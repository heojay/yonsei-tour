경포 해변,212건의<U+00A0>리뷰,강원도 강릉,1위(48곳의 강릉 소재 관광지 중),"I live not far from this area and so have been coming to Gangneung quite regularly for six years now. Gyeongpo is a wonderful place in that the beaches of the East Sea are far cleaner than those on the West Coast of Korea. The water quality is excellent. Wonderful to swim in. The adjacent lake is an excellent place for bird watching, with herons, cormorants, and sandpipers dominant from April to October, followed by various migratory duck species from late fall to early spring. My only gripe about the area is that the restaurants are slightly overpriced IMO. Can rent tubes and do paragliding, jetskiing, etc. St John's hotel, with one of the best saunas in the area, is a 15~20 minute walk away at Gangmun Beach.The place is good, a very beautiful lake view from the hotel, needs more attention to hotel management. the supplementary items are not up to the mark.Expected so much more.The beach is known for its romantic resting sculptures for couples. But there are just a few, spread along the wide beach. I really meant it by 'wide'. You gotta walk to each and everyone of them.The beach is huge. Lots of sand before you could reach the water.Directions:. Gangneung Bus Terminal. Bus 202. Alight at Gyeongpodae BeachC ( 18.12.18 ) The beach was famous place, and one of excellent beach in East Sea. There was well-managed and had good sand. There was very good place to enjoy sea bathing in summer and walk along the beach. Excellent beach.Wake up early and be rewarded with a surreal experience of the epic sunrise seen directly from the beach. The horizon stretches uninterrupted end-to-end.We live in Gangneung so we visit gyeongpo beach alot in the summer. The beach is quite nice and warm in the summer. The only downpoint is that is always packed of people. In the night they always have some festivals or music playing so its good even in the night. You could visit many restaurants and bars around that place in the morning and night plus during the day you could rent boats!This is a beautiful beach located in the east coast of korea. The area got a boost with the winter Olympics of 2018. Many new hotels, motels, restaurants and coffee shops were built. Unfortunately after the Olympics not many people are visiting. Beaches are beautiful, white sand and long and importantly not crowded. Recommended to visit.I loved this nice long beach walk which is decked so it's very easy to walk while enjoying the ocean and pine trees on the other side.We attended the winter Olympics and our accommodations were a block away from the beach. We used the great amenities of restaurants and hotels that catered to the beach crowd to our vantage. It was cold and windy while we were there, so not your typical beach weather. In celebration of the Olympics there were some great sculptures and other displays which made the cold weather less of a factor as we still enjoyed our time on the beach.This is a very popular beach, although there was no swimming in February! I was here for the Olympics, and there were cool large sculptures on the beach, intended to be burned on weekends. The sunrises were gorgeous, and there are lots of good food choices nearby."
정동진 해변,136건의<U+00A0>리뷰,강원도 강릉 강동면 정동진리,3위(48곳의 강릉 소재 관광지 중),"Leaving the train station, straight ahead was the rail bikes. Super fun with minimal pedalling. Wished it was a little longer.Leaving the station to the left is the pristine beach with magnificent views of the Suncruise hotel. Hourglass park a little more farther.Good day trip.This is a clean and great beach. It also has lots of sea glass so we enjoyed an afternoon collecting lots of beautiful pieces. There is no shade however. There are lots of touristy things next to the beach like the time museum and the little peddle train but we chose to just walk.Foreigners can not ride nor register to purchase the rail bikes since they are only required Korean credit card. Global Korea???? A representative couldn't (did not) know what is going on.외국인은 레일바이크를 탈수가 없는걸 아시나요? ISP 프로그램은 한국 현지인에게만 할수 있는 프로그램입니다. 외국인은 할수가 없군요. 한국사람에게 현금을 주고 해야 할 지경 입니다.글로벌을 외치면서 너무나 아쉽습니다.We checked out the beach through the railway, we checked out the station too. Fits couples and families with small kids.in the middle of not really somewhere - but I didn't check before - hence - perfect for lovers.maybe more liveliness in peak season.Beautiful aqua green ocean in a small town. I loved the smell and nice color of the ocean. Beach trail that starts from the parking lot on top of the Sun Cruise hotel was awesome.We took an overnight train to the beach and as a result we saw the sun rising over the ocean. It is a very special experience. The beach is beautiful and easy to get to, but its a little rural and people don’t speak a lot of English. There is a good bus system that can be used to get around as well.Cute little sea side town with quirky attractions, nice beach and lots of local restaurants but not a lot of EnglishBeach was not that long but the scenery itself is very satisfactory, there is a rail bike you can ride - from the railway station nearby. it is around 40~50 minutes experience. good for family activity.This is the beach near the Sun Cruise Resort-- famous for that ship hotel on a cliff. In fact, you could take a scenic photo with that as backdrop.At the time we can when it was a super peak season in the country, this beach just had few people. The sand is light brown. It's a relaxing spot. Swimming is only allowed till 6pm although the sun set at 7:30pm."
초당동 순두부 마을,60건의<U+00A0>리뷰,강원도 강릉 초당동 (우) 210-120,9위(48곳의 강릉 소재 관광지 중),"Great place to visit for some traditional tofu restaurants. The tofu here is different as in other places because saltwater is used which makes the tofu soft. I really liked it. I ate at 농촉순두부 restaurant and had some tofu ice cream at 초당110. Give it a try, a good overall experience!After reading so much about sundubu (fresh tofu) as a specialty in Gangneung on the east coast of Korea, we decided to give it a try after walking the searoad or badabuchaegil.We headed to Chodang village and chose a restaurant without a queue and ordered the non spicy set. On taking the first mouthful of the sundubu, we were delighted to find the taste to be familiar as it is similar to the best of Japanese and Ipoh tofu.It was a simple set with few side dishes for which we paid 18,000 won for both of us. We then adjourned to a cafe across the road. The lovely pine trees around the cafe contributed to its nice laid back feel. This area is well served by cabs and was only a 5,000 won ride to the Gangneung station.Short street lined with tofu shops. Some specialized in seafood, so check out store front pictures. Felt welcomed even though English was basically ""hot"" or ""no hot"". CC accepted. Also had a popular tofu ice cream. Daytime hours are best.Chodang Sundubu Village is a place where they serve soft, milky and delicious tofu. There are many restaurants to choose from but I was told that this one is the oldest and the most popular. You can tell they are popular with the long lines outside.This street is famous for popular dishes with Tofu and fish. You can order soup or thick curry with rice. It’s quit spicy but still worth trying because of speciality of the area. Recommended. Cost around 30,000 for 2 persons.Our Airbnb was basically inside of the Tofu Village, which was great for us. We found the hours confusing -- not easy to get dinner on a weeknight as most places seemed to have closed around lunchtime, while Saturday was crawling with people. If you can figure out how to avoid the crowds but get to the shops when they're open, it's well worth it. The food is excellent and its a neat cultural experience. We ate at two different restaurants. The first time we ordered the JungShik (dinner set) and the second we just ordered a jiggae (soup) to share. Both times we really enjoyed our meal.Freshly made soft tofu which I loved and this is great for vegetarians.  Price was reasonable at $8-10 per dish.Menus are in English. Although our waitress didn't speak English, she kindly got the host who was able to help us and recommend things. We got the Tofu set which same with tofu soup, two fish dishes cooked different ways, a nice, large piece of tofu, and a bunch of sides, all for 28,000 won (more than enough for two people).The restaurant was busy, but spacious and the food was delicious. I am not a huge fan of tofu, but its a must if you find yourself on this side of Korea.We had a great experience here and could not recommend it enough.Sundubu means fresh tofu in Korea. The best place to try their special version of tofu here in Gangneung. Since it locates near the sea, the best ingredient to make the tofu is sea water instead of usually plaster.The ""Chodang"" tofu tastes just wonderful, though it looks different than those normal tofu.Must try if you have the chance to visit Gangneung.I'm clearly not a tofu fan but since it's Gangneug specialty we wanted to try it. We asked the taxi driver to bring us to a famous sundubu place and he brougth us there (check the picture). When you enter, you notice a lot of korean celebrities pictures and broadcasting channels signs, I guess it was a famous place. Apparently they use sea water which makes it really tasty.The sundubu tasted amazing (Jambong Sundubu and Cho Sundubu) and the side dishes were amazing. One of the greatest surprise we had in Gangneung. The village is close to the beach so I would recommend to catch a taxi and to ask him to bring you to ""sundubu maheul"" or ask for ""sundubu matchib""."
고성 통일 전망대,45건의<U+00A0>리뷰,강원도 고성 현내면 마차진리 188,1위(19곳의 고성 소재 관광지 중),"This review is in three parts - the Observatory, its accompanying museum, and the new DMZ museumWe drove hire car so getting there not a problem. When we got to the military checkpoint, about 5 km out, a pleasant, young soldier explained in passing english that we had to turn around and go back to the other side of a tunnel, turn off and get the pass we needed there. We followed those instructions and they were fine. At the office, located in the back of a souvenir shop, a man gave us a form and english translation for how to fill it in. We paid him 6000 won. When we had completed the form we handed it to another bloke and he took 5000 won. We think 1 was the Pass fee, the other the Observatory fee.We returned northwards, the soldier greeted is worth a cheery 'welcome back'. Car, boot was checked. Given some instructions about not photographing military and a bright yellow card to put on dashboard.We went to the DMZ museum first. We were in by 9.05 and the only ones there for an hour or more. Another very good S Korea museum, in parts. It focuses more on the DMZ than the War. There is english on the ground floor, though more would be better, but little on the upper floor. It is all very modern. We them drove the 2km or so to the Observatory. You park below and it is uphill walk to the building. There there are outside platforms to look across to the border. There are also some pay for binoculars. If you look carefully you can make out a ridge running fence and path away in the distance. All looks pretty desolate It looks like they are building a higher modern observatory, all stainless steel and height, but when open don't know. Only date we could make out on the building screens was 2017, so they're late. Across the car park there is then the War Museum. Pretty depressing and aging somewhat. Also hardly any english there, just some English headings above Korean writing We were in the area for about 3 hour and it took more than an hour each way from Sokcho. At no stage were poor passports checked. Nor were we stopped from taking pictures at the observatory towards the borderCertainly an historical and fascinating place to visitPretty amazing, hard to get to if you don't have a car and no buses go right to the observatory so plan your trip.Did this as part of an organised tour run by Hanjin Tours. Not quite sure what I was expecting but ended up being a little disappointed by the experience. You get taken to an observatory where you can see the DMZ in the distance and there are a few artefacts (and some art) to look at. Didn’t get to see any guards etc.This was a great experience and a must see if you visit South Korea. You can see where North Korea starts and the observatory has a great history.Probably hard to reach without a car. You have to stop and register 10 km before reaching the guards. Feels a bit tensed while passing, but once you're in it feels like you're in a tourist area again. Not crowded at all, at least not in March. The observatory is easy to reach, it's a five minute walk up a hill. The view is great, I would even say beautiful, but of course its chilling when you think of what you are actually looking at. You can se the border and far away a small city. Not too much information in english, but it's not a big problem. Among the most interesting and unique things we did while in South Korea.Not sure how easy this is to access via public transport. Most drive. You must stop 10km south of the observatory and fill out a form and pay. Then you are shepherded 30 vehicles at a time along the road, in and out of weaving tank traps and barbed wire. Car will be checked out by ROK military and then a 2km drive to the observatory. There is a white building on the left at the top of the hill with uninterrupted views over North Korea's beaches. In the car park there is a small, awfully presented museum (free) about military life. It was mostly fascinating for its awfulness. Not many food options here.The drive from Seoul is not hard, maybe 120 miles, and then all the way north on Highway 7. The ""educational"" film is 4 minutes all told. 2 minutes on the rules, the rest is all about how awesomely Korea put itself back together, better than ever, following the war. The restaurant at the site is a train, you eat inside. Korean food (Hwang tae is the local fix of choice) is good there, but I tried Pizza Don Katsu, so pizza fixings deep fried together--might fine. The observatory allows you to look into NK, but nobody is visible, probably ever. The beaches are beautiful, and sadly fenced off until who knows when to stop infiltrations from the north. The museum at the observatory is free and has a very interesting section on South Korea efforts to recovery missing war dead from around the country. Also a great display of how many UN troops from what countries came and fought and died here. When you leave the slightly run-down observatory place there is a new and beautiful DMZ museum just down the road, very nice. Interactive themes for kids and a lot to look at. Gift shop is nice too. This entire day is great cheap and easy if you speak Korean. If not, find a friend to go along.you can know today of korean unification and see north korea's nowadays.If you want to see north korea safely and know the sad history of Korean divisionThe most interesting part was the DMZ museum. It gives good explanations in English, though everything isn't translated. The staff at the museum speaks good English and will be able to help you with directions to the observatory. Though it isn't hard since it's on your left when getting out of the museum and there is only one road. The observatory isn't that much of a big deal we thought. Try going there by good weather if you want a chance of actually seeing something. And if you are going by your own means, you will need a car to get there since they don't let motorcyclists or pedestrians in. Don't forget to get the paperwork done in Machajin at the Tongil security park. The staff there doesn't speak English but patience, good will, your best efforts and a smile will get you there :)"
망상 해수욕장,26건의<U+00A0>리뷰,강원도 동해 망상동 393-16 Mangsang-dong,3위(19곳의 동해 소재 관광지 중),"Strong Breeze hits the shore with Strong Waves. Refreshing and lotsa restaurants that you can choose from. We stayed in Donghae Boyang Spa Convention Hotel which is great to relax after our Spartan eventMangsang Beach was a very nice surprise. The beach is huge, stretching for kilometers. The sand is nice and the water clean. The water gets deep very steeply, so it can be dangerous, and lifeguards have no tolerance for those who step outsied of the designated swimming areas. Another good thing is that the beach is not only long, but it's also wide, which is great for people who want to play soccer, fly a kite or just want some extra room to run around. Finally, the central area of the beach has a nice area whit various dining options, coffee shops, small stores and even a small arcade.Mangsang beach.. located in the east coastal bed of south korea.. we went with an 2 year old kid. Similar to sokcho beach, the waves and depths are high for kids.. but for adults visitor, this beach is an awesome one.Overall a worth visit and not a much visit place..No cons for this beach.We (me & my fiance) visited Mangsang Beach in the middle of September, which should normally be monsun time, but this day was sunny and hot. In any case it was after season and additionally during the week, which resulted in the beach being almost empty. Unfortunately, ""No swimming"" signs were killing the fun right away, most likely due to strong waves and currents at this day. This was a shame as the beach is very nice and the clear, not-too-cold water would have made a great time. So we decided to just walk along the water in the southern direction.And here is what you should absolutely be aware of: The southern part of Mangsang Beach is a restricted military area, which is announced by one (!) small sign in Korean language only (photo attached). Rule of thumb: If you see barbwire to your right and the sea to your left, better turn around. We walked almost one kilometer into the restricted area, which features some nice parts of the beachline like rocks and a creek leading into the sea, before some heavily armed South Korean soldiers hastily jumped on their watchtower and blew their whistles to signal us to turn around immediately. Given that there are other watchtowers and some CCTV cameras before that, someone clearly wasn't doing his guard shift correctly... Why didn't we turn around long before? Easy - this far up north, basically the whole South Korean coastline is fortified against North Korean infiltration attempts using mini-subs. One can see soldiers patrolling along the beach on other locations, too, so the barbwire itself did not work as a particular warning to us.Enough of the scary stuff, the rest of the beach is wonderful and, given good wave conditions, clearly is an awesome place to go swimming. There were some quads and jetskis lying in front of a store, I assume they're for rent, and there are also stationary caravans to rent for a camping experience. There's also an Italian-style restaurant called ""Piano"" run by Koreans, close to the main vehicle entrance to the beach. A very neat place with little-above-average prices, but very good food, a tasteful interior and a beautiful view at the sea.The beach is long and wide, so there are lots of people and no shortage of space on the sand. There are also lots of shops and restaurants, loud speakers, and the constant whistles of obnoxious, speedo-clad (horrifyingly small), lifeguards. It's not a relaxing or quiet experience, but could be fun for families and groups who'd like a lot of space. The beach/sand has a pretty sharp drop off to the water, which makes for pretty hard waves and a strong current I suppose. The lifeguards are very strict about people going out in the water. I will grant them that it's pretty dangerous, especially for people not used to the ocean or young swimmers, but they whistle non stop and very rudely order you back out of the water (I was literally standing in water up to my shins when I was whistled). One guy in a tube went out in the water a good deal further than they liked and four lifeguards dramatically swam out and pushed him back to the sand. Stick to the small and pleasant beaches around Donghae. Mangsang's waves and surf is tough and the lifeguards ruin it anyway."
추암해수욕장,25건의<U+00A0>리뷰,강원도 동해 북평동,2위(19곳의 동해 소재 관광지 중),"CC+c ( 19.05.17 ) My family visited this beach for viewing Candlestick Rock. The beach was not big area, but beautiful and calm. Though another beach in East Sea was good, this beach was more calm and good. Some restaurant was operating, and proper size to enjoy sea. One of good beach in Gangwon-do.This is a very beautiful beach right near the candlestick structure. The surf pounding the beach late in the afternoon is awesome.It is recommended to go there in the day rather than at night. The view is more beautiful but there is constructiom going on so it would not be as beautiful, yet.Beautiful and busy beach. Lots of umbrella and safety tube facilities. Lots of eateries opposite beachfront Water good swimming temparatureClear water, Great scenic view,Good food and Friendly people. The Perfect weekend scape with family in relaxed atmosphere.This is a wonderful place to relax and enjoy the beautiful sea view while sipping a cup of tea at a cafe just along the beach. The cafe even played the theme songs from a few of the Korean hit drama. Such a nice cosy ambience .Remember to bring along a big straw hat and apply enough sunscreen as there are not many places with shade. The sea is very clear and the place is currently not crowded with people."
삼척 해양 레일바이크,47건의<U+00A0>리뷰,강원도 삼척 근덕면 공양왕길 2,1위(3곳의 삼척 소재 야외 활동 중),"Hi I'm local here. Rose Park is one of the greatest places to visit in Samcheock. It is a park famous it's many rose. I think the admission, you don't have to make a reservation in advance. I recommend this place especially for couples.You can go to rose park using a taxi. You can simply take a cab, and it takes 10 minutes to get here from the terminal. Also, it takes about 3,000 sons for service. There aren't have near by restaurant In addition, there is river in front of rose park. 장미공원에는 정말 많은 장미들이 있습니다 제가 생각하기에 장미공원을 걷다보면 분명 좋은 추억을 쌓을 수 있을 것입니다.I did this with my friend in the pouring rain in October and had a blast, so I knew I had to come again in the spring with my mom.We arrived at 11:25am to find the ticket office closed for lunch. The office was to open again at 12pm and bikes starting at 1pm. Why would you close a very popular tourist attraction for 2 hours in the middle of the day? We nearly missed being able to do this because we were told there were no bikes until 3pm, but when we asked 20 min later there was one available for the 1pm departure.Information on the bike is difficult to find in English (even Chrome can't translate the webpage).Overall we had a great time, but it impacted our schedule for the day greatly.A really pleasant ride along the coast and through a few tunnels. The bikes are on a rail (obviously) so you can only go as fast as the car in front of yours. So this can slow things down quite a bit.Travelling with a friend. It was a 5.4km of cycling but the view and everything was worth the money and cycling!Better reserve the seats early during peak time but youre gonna need someone who knows Korean. Go to the tourist center to help you make the reservation!Suitable for people who love nice views while exercising (:This a fun family bonding experience that anyone can enjoy. You will bike close to the coast with the view of the gorgeous east coast sea and cliffs and totally relax and have a fun experience.It was a fun and relaxing ride with a view. The ride started on time as scheduled. The sea view was beautiful and riding in the tunnels was exhilarating with the lights/music. With so much to see, we didn't really feel that the distance was long or an issue. In no time, we reached the end.However, a word of caution to be careful of your belongings during riding. I hung my expensive Rayban sunglasses on my shirt but it dropped off in the midst of my excitement and photo taking. The only sad memory of this trip. Sob!This was a chilled out ride with some pretty, weird and wacky sightings. It's a totally unique experience, and I'm glad we gave it a go.Last time we could not enjoy the rail bike as we did not make a reservation in advance. This time we could make a reservation luckily even though we tried the reservation 3 days before.As the course is located along the coast of East sea, the scene is wonderful and we also encounter some tunnels. As it was Summer, we tried the 1st time in the morning.The rail biking with all the family together with a stunning coast view is fun and memorable. Please keep in mind that you should make a reservation in advance on the internet site.I went with my family. We have passed couple of tunnels in the whole 5.4km ride.. the tunnels are filled with patterned lightingz.. kid enjoyed it. There was 7 minutes break during the ride..Overall it took an hour for to complete the rail biking event. Online ticket booking is also possible.Inviting view of the ocean while on the rail bike. Be prepared to pedal and sweat (during summer), good combination of tour and work out. Ladies, I don't recommend being on maxi dresses or long skirts if nobody is going to pedal the bike for you, thanks to my husband he was prepared. A good experience though, a must try!"
설악산 국립공원,985건의<U+00A0>리뷰,강원도 속초,1위(39곳의 속초 소재 관광지 중),"It was very windy when I visited Seoraksan and the cable car stopped functioning. My friends and I hiked the Biryong trail to see the waterfall. The waterfall is stunning and worth the hike. The hike is not too long distance but relatively difficult for a beginner hiker like me. The Hallasan Yeongsil trail is easier than Biryong trail but much longer distant. Biryong trail has more stone paths, hanging bridge etc. Overall, I would revisit Seoraksan again for the beautiful scenery.If you want to be in nature but don’t want to hike, this park is perfect for you. You can take your family here for a nice stroll, but make sure you go on a sunny and warm day unless you want to freeze! I went when it was super cold (but hiked, so it was OK) so I took a warm jacket and it was alright, but I think it would’ve been much better if I had gone in the springtime.I did not join the hiking tour but took an easier one ie getting to the top in a cable car. The whole trip was much easier than originally thought. I had to wait only 40 minutes for the cable car (running every 5 minutes and carrying 50 persons; best to buy the cable car ticket as early as possible); took pictures of the Buddha statue and of the surrounding areas in the meantime, before going back to the cable car station. Then there was a walk of some minutes up to the fortress. The walk was not difficult and the stairs were lined with anti-slip rubber. At the top there were many people; all coming up for the expansive views. The whole trip took about 3 hours.Can easily spend days here doing all the various walks, bring water as some of the hikes are a little tough but are so worth itHailing from a lovely mountainous place myself, I take hikes and surrounding mountains very seriously while traveling. There’s just something soul soothing about strolling along beautiful scenery, surrounded by nature. Seoraksan is massive, with the best views coming from the hikes themselves rather than just the cable car area shown in photos attached. There are food areas near Seoraksan cable car, and great snacks available this time of year such as Hotteok. It an absolute must see, photos cannot do it justice. Definitely look up more on the park before you go, you won’t be disappointed.The easiest(??) and one of the popular route to seoraksan is to the Biryong waterfalls. We went here on a weekend, so it was like everyone from Seoul wanted to see Seoraksan. By the last week of October, there are already autumn leaves around the middle of the hike up to the water fall. If you want a more leisurely hiking pace, go here on a weekend. There are many restaurants, a coffee shop and many agricultural stores, but nobody speaks English. There are some street food, however, if you have allergies, the Ahjumma's will not be able to explain the ingreadients.It was autumn and though it came later than predicted this year, the view was still amazing. I would definitely come again and try out the trails. Went up through cable car and the hiking to the peak from cable car station on top, was not steep (+ stairs). I would like to enjoy just sitting still while watching the view for at least an hour up there. Unfortunately due to time constraint, was not able to do it. If you stay in Seoul and would like to come here, make sure you arrive at the express terminal station early in the morning to take earliest bus to Sokcho!Be aware that this park is very busy! Weekends are a no no, so we arrived on a Monday but even then it was crowded. However we saw some lovely Autumn colours and the paths are quite good to walk. We did take one to the round rock and this wasn’t so easy for walking - a lots of steps made of large rocks really. Enjoyable though.We enjoyed a full day in the park. We appreciated views of beautiful riverscapes, autumnal tree foliage and rugged mountain formations. The varying angles and levels of light added to the spectacle. Be warned: we were there on a Monday and it was very busy with long queues of cars to enter the site and lots of people.The park is Very well maintained considering that it is quite a huge park. Requires lots of walking, for some hiking. Take the cable car for a closer view of Mt. Seorak & its surroundings. There is a big sitting buddha & temple as well. The natural landscape of the park makes for a relaxing ambience."
울산바위,190건의<U+00A0>리뷰,강원도 속초 설악동 설악산국립공원 내 (우) 217-120,2위(39곳의 속초 소재 관광지 중),"I went in November and I thought it would be really cold, but the weather on the mountain was so nice I had to take off my hoodie and wear my tank top to hike! The hike up to Ulsanbawi takes around 2-4 hours depending on how fit you are; it took me around 3 because we went slow. The mountain looked beautiful even with its leafless trees & I would love to go back to hike here again. Please be advised though: the hike is rather strenuous and you need to be at a relatively fit level to be able to hike to the top!This is the best hike in the whole park but warning it is very tough and you need to be fit to do itThe hike up was really tiring for a good 1.5 - 2 hours (upwards) but well worth as this is not a very touristy place (you'll find yourself hiking amongst mostly locals). Go early so you don't have to squeeze w everyone else when going up and when you've reached the top. We started at 9am and would say the crowd was moderate - we did have to wait a few minutes before our turn to take photo w the rock ，The light plays on the white rocks all day with changing angles and intensities. This is a spectacular formation set in an amazing landscape.The path is okay, it starts easily and gets more exhausting when approaching the peak. As a sportive person it is absolutely feasible, it took us 1.5h to reach the peak. The view was stunning! I would recommend to start as early as possible. We began at 8 am and there were only few people, when we hiked down after a looong break the path was very crowded!! After that we climbed up to Geumganggul cave, the path is more difficult but less exhausting and the view was even more beautiful than ulsanbawi and less crowded. So do ulsanbawi early to avoid the crowds and continue with Geumganggul, if you want to seize the day :)This hike is an absolute must when visiting Seoraksan National Park. The hike takes about four hours back and forth. The hike starts easy enough walking trough a beautiful forest on good trails, but it gets strenuous after you've passed Heundeulbawi Rock. From then on the path leads you straight up so many stairs that I lost count. But the view after conquering this climb is so rewarding that you'll forget all your suffering in a heart beat.The Ulsanbawi rock formation is gorgeous, but you need to be a a good condition to get there.Ulsanbawi Rock is a unique rock formation composed of six granite peaks. One needs to be of general fitness to do this round trip hike of 4 hours. The initial trail is relatively easy, walking along the forest on big gravel rocks, boardwalk and stairs. After about an hour, I arrived at the famous Heundeulbawi Rock and had a 15 mins break for snacks and drinks.From Heundeulbawi Rock to Ulsanbawi Rock, the slope gets relatively steep. The majority of the trek is made up of steps, and the steeper stone sections come with ropes while the steel steps come with handrails. I needed to my arms to pull myself up from this point onwards. I finally arrive at Ulsanbawi Rock after hiking 1 hour 45 mins from the base. To reach the summit, I had to queue for about 15 mins along the narrow stretch, just to take photos of the flag and the rock indicating 836m.At the summit, one is rewarded with spectacular view of Seorak Mountain. There were many local hikers resting in the open space to have their meals as well as enjoying the view. The weather was perfect, clear blue sky with some clouds adding texture to the background. I spent 45 mins at the summit before my descent. Overall, it was an enjoyable hike, though tiring.Just want to comment on difficulty. I am a 65 year old man, in decent, but not great, shape. The walk was strenuous, especially the last 0.6 km. Uphill on either steps or a rock path. By the time I reached the top, I was quite pooped. But glad I did it. For someone younger in good shape it shoud not be that hard. For someone older or in poor shape, it will be a challenge. Also, I did it in April, so it wasn't very hot.Show lessWe decided to climb up Ulsanbawi even though it was rated ""advanced"" on KTO website. We were glad we did because the climb up was great and the view even better. It wasn't not difficult as there were proper tracks and stairs although some parts were rocky steps. The difficult part was probably the energy and endurance to keep walking and climbing. But it was worth it.The last .8 km seemed to take forever. Be sure to go early if you wish to avoid the crowds. Got there just after 7am, taking pictures before really starting out on the course around 7:30am (on Wed 10/24). Total trip time ~4 hours. The crowds started coming in when I went back down."

It's educational because you are going to learn history about North and South Korea. Before going inside the tunnel, we wore a protective helmet. We walked for five minutes to get to the ride stop. Since there were a number of people when we visited, we had to queue in for the trolley ride. With this ride, we were able to get to the inner part of the tunnel. Unfortunately, we were not allowed to take photos. After the ride, we went back outside and had a chit-chat with the soldiers since they know English well.This is a great experience to see what lengths North Korea went to to try and tunnel through to south Korea.First you HAVE to go to ""Eulji Observatory.The 4th Tunnel Ticket office.I have placed a screenshot of the location.There you will show your Passport and fill out a form with car registration also .They will give you 3 pieces of paper.One for guard at the gate before the tunnel.One with guard at the tunnel and one for guard at the observatory.If you don't get these before you get to the tunnel you will not get through.They say you have an hour at the tunnel and an hour at the Observation.At the tunnel you will see ashort doco on the war.Then the guard will tell you no photos inside the tunnel.You will walk 100 meters to a small train.Then you will have a 100 meter ride,stop and return backwards.Its noisy but save.Then you return to the outside and head for the Observatory.Once in the Observatory the lady will tell you a little history.You look through a large window at North Korea.No photography allowed.inside.You then return via the guards at the gate.If you have a car you must use LOW gear on the way back.Very steep long road.The entries are all FREE.Going into the tunnel and seeing the efforts that the North Koreans have gone through in an effort to be ready to attack the South is remarkable. This is the DMZ in your face, at your fingertips. No photos are permitted, but when you see the tunnel and imagine that something like 10,000 soldiers per hour could have gotten through, it is shocking. The minefields (with live munitions) are just yards away. This, more than anything, reminds you that the Koreans play for all of the marbles, all of the time.It is quite the experience to visit this place, put on a hard hat and walk the several hundred metres to the end. But it's not for the unfit or those with a heart condition...the tunnel is a steep descent and a very tiring climb back to the top awaits!The good news is that a mining style railway exists and is used to transport visitors to the bottom who are not keen to walk.You'll be asked to store your cameras in lockers at the top, as photos inside the tunnel are prohibited. If you're out touring the DMZ then tunnel 4 is a must.This location is pretty remote, but to experience it firsthand gives you an uneasy sense of ongoing ""state of war"" that exists and that overshadows what is a pretty peaceful area. It's pretty incredible to see first hand the work the North Koreans did was by hand. The views above looking over the DMZ is also beautiful and eerie. If the business of Panmunjom doesn't appeal to you, then this is a place worth checking out."

There is another theater that is close to CGV and another, Lotte Cinema, which is in another section of the city. As far as I know these are the only three large theaters that show movies in Wonju. CGV is also the nicest. It is situated directly above the bus terminal and can be accessed via elevator on both sides of the bus terminal. Tickets may be purchased on the seventh floor and movies are shown on the seventh and ninth floors. The theater is very large, the area where you buy tickets and concessions has a lot of space. There is also an arcade of sorts and a Lotteria on the same floor where you purchase tickets. The staff is very friendly and helpful, I have seen dozens of films at CGV and never had a problem with anyone. Prices are in line with the other two theaters and the quality of their concessions is probably on par with the other two as well. The theaters themselves are stadium seating style and vary in size. Some are relatively small and some quite large. I have been to all three theaters in Wonju and also prefer the seating in CGV to the other two theaters (although the seating in the Megabox theater is comparable). Sound and picture quality is good and the theater stays relatively clean based on my observations. Essentially all three theaters in Wonju are relatively similar, CGV is just slightly better overall."

The other galleries within the museum however were beautiful and interesting even for a non-museum lover. The architecture of the building was amazing and the view outside was spectacular.

I'm quite sad that I only had an hour to spend there, but I am for sure going back in the near future.

From the history of paper, art painting and the exquisite James Turrel imagination. A new experience for seeing this. It's lot of fun with groups.

Starting with the location and the architecture, continuing with the artworks everything is outstanding. The building has a clear marked design of Tadao Ando and it's wonderful, in line with all other building that this Japanses architect has built. The buildings, the small lake, the park, everything is exceptional. The artworks inside the building are not very much but all of them of excellent quality.

It's very pretty in the nature and easy to access. I recommend visiting this amazing temple if you're in Inje-gun.- Well-known for locals as the temporal lodge of former president and Han Yongwoon.- Damaged and rebuilt several times in the past.- There's no admission fee.- The stone tower area and the stream before the temple look great. In fall, there's pretty fall foliage as well.- Temple Stay is available.- The Suryeom Valley trail until Suryeomgdong Shelter is also fun and easy. You can walk along the beautiful valley and water. It takes about 1~2 hours for one way.- You can also climb up the mountain route starting from the temple.- The shuttle ticket office and platform to the shuttle is at the parking lot after passing the bridge.How to get:For mountain climbers coming from the mountain, it's on the downside from Oseam Temple. From Inje Baekdam Village that has a bus station connecting to other cities, there's a shuttle from Tourist Information Center. The ticket is 2,500 won. It's a long hillside way to walk and takes about 15 minutes by bus.Baekdamsa, of the Jogye Seon (Zen) Buddhist order is located in the Seoraksan mountains, not too far south of the North Korean border. The temple itself has only a few historically important or architecturally interesting buildings, though all are very beautiful. You can arrange a ""Temple Stay"" here, and participate in many of the chanting, meditation, dining, and other activities. There is usually a good contingent of Koreans doing that. There is a great 20-minute drum ceremony at 6:00 pm and 7:00 am every day, timed with the beginning of services in the temple. This is a working monastery temple, meaning that there are a number (app. 20) young monks in training that live here, including about 4 Westerners. There is a little tea shop on the grounds w/ nice local teas, as well as a coffee/sweet shop and tourist shop for Buddhist knick-knacks.Located in the Seoraksan National Park, it is also a favorite spot for hiking up along the mountain river gorge, filled with huge boulders. As you go up from Baekdamsa, here are a number of smaller temples along the way as you go, and typically lots of tourists hiking up and down the path. Lots of wild animals, we saw boar, antelope, a fox, lots of birds and critters.Unfortunately, it is hard to get here without a car. There is a bus to-and-form Seoul, but it is about a 25-minute hike from where you get deposited on the highway to the shuttle bus up to the temple (you can, of course, walk up). Nobody at the bus station in Seoul will help you with English, and there are no English or roman-script signs along the way, and it would be easy to miss your stop. The return is even more complicated-- we couldn't find the bus stop or where to buy the tickets (even w/ a Korean speaking friend helping), and when the bus did arrive it was full and we had to wait for the next bus. . . and the next. . . in the end, we took a taxi to a larger town and w/ the help of a friend finally got a bus for the two-hour ride back to Seoul.It may not suitable for foreign tourists, because there is not beatiful architecture.However this temple has some role for Korean people.A road to this temple is one of trekking coures of Seolak mountain.A monk named Manhae had lived in this temple. He was very famous because he had struggled for independence of Korea.If you are interesting for Buddhism, I will recommend that you apply to temple-stay in this temple.You either need a car to get here or to join a coach tour. We drove to the bottom of the mountain (east part of Seoraksan National Park) and parked. (I don't know the cost of the carpark). Then you have to take a minibus up to the temple (again I don't remember the cost) because the road is restricted to buses and service vehicles. The road winds along the river up into the mountain until you reach the temple. So hidden. So perfect. You cross a bridge and you're in another world. This is where Han Yong-un (aka Manhae), monk, poet and political activist lived. Travelling back to the carpark at the bottom of the mountain there are cafes with delicious homecooked food.This is one of my favourite place to go when I'm around here. Though sometimes crowded with visitors, the temple itself has so serene an air that I feel my mind is cleared, and has old tradition in regard to the famous buddhist monks in Korea. They run ""Temple stay"" program that provides bed(actually ""Ondol"") and vegetarian meals and helps take part in some buddhist ceremonies for very reasonable price.The Baekdam Valley, which was named for having more than one hundred ponds and gave this temple the name, Baekdamsa, can be said to be the most beautiful valley in Korea. I recommend you rather walk by feet from Yongdaeri village where the bus stop, along this valley to take better look at this unspeakable colour of water. it takes about 2 hours. but if you have short time budget, you may take local bus. By the way, this local bus gets in the way of the walking travelors too much and makes them worry about air pollution. I wish that this cement-paved road were turned back to more nature-friendly trail only for pedestrians and trekkers."

For KDrama fan like myself, I am so excited to come here, to see the exact location of DOTS. This is place used to be a coal mine, and now a museum. Other than DOTS, KDrama Phantom (starring So Ji Sub, my favorite actor) and Running Man variety show also filming here. If you are a fan of KDrama this place is a must visit!An interesting museum, it has a lot collection of antiques such as telephone, piano, masks, statues etc. it also famous for the K-Drama shooting place Descendants of the Sun. Might be interesting for someone, but also it's kinda creepy museum. Grade 7 out of 10Even I'm not into the DOTS drama, but I enjoyed my visit to Samtan Art Mine. This museum features a vast collection of previous coal mine items as well as few attractive arts collection. The highlight is the room used for the DOTS drama shooting location.My friends and I had a wonderful time exploring Samtan Art Mine. The property is huge and the sheer volume of art all around is mind boggling.

제 2 땅굴,11건의<U+00A0>리뷰,"강원도 철원 Gwangsam-ri, Cheorwon-eup (우) 269-820",3위(15곳의 철원 소재 관광지 중),"Me and my friends went there last Winter together with other foreigners thru an agency (Adventure Korea). It is not easy to enter the area (DMZ), I guess we passed thru one or two checkpoints (gate). The easiest way, I guess, is to book thru a known agency. On the area, we are not allowed to take picture at the right side where the South Korean army are located. But free to take picture at the left side or in front of the tunnel entrance. Inside, they restrict visitors from taking photos or videos. Some portions are restricted or closed. The tunnel has low ceiling which is slightly uncomfortable for tall person. That's why they provide a helmet at the entrance to protect your head. Inside, the floor is slightly wet but not slippery. Also, it is well lit and not scary. It is also safe for kids. The place is nice and interesting. I would recommend to visit the small museum outside the tunnel. Also, they have small shop where we were able to buy an authentic North Korean paper bill for souvenir.The JSA was closed on all of the days we were in Korea so I looked around for opinions on whether to go on the 3rd Tunnel tour without the JSA or find something else. I read about the Cheorwon DMZ area and thought it seemed interesting. Our visit was on a Monday and there were very few other people visiting for a tour. It was a nice experience and definitely was not a touristy area at all so we were able to just take in the history and stories that our guide told us.This site is within the restricted zone, so you can only visit as part of the tours that leave from the tourist office at the Iron Triangle Memorial Hall (on weekends, or take your own car on weekdays). There is not a great deal to see but the interest lies in the experience of walking down into a tunnel which was stealthily dug by North Koreans. You are handed a safety helmet by a solider, as you walk into the tunnel. It is not particularly small (nothing like the Chu Chi tunnels in Vietnam) but there are some places where rocks jut out, so you could bang your head. You walk about 500m into the tunnel and then turn around to come back (it was rather damp and slippery so wear good shoes). Not sure what the furtherest point represents as the tour was in Korean only. There's not that much to see inside, they do point out some spots that had landmines . You are allowed to take photos at the entrance (even with the guards), but not inside the tunnel. There is also a small museum of wartime artifacts and a shop selling simple north korean goods and even army rations!You need to book ahead if you want to visit here. On weekends you are not allowed to take your own car so need to use scheduled tour bus. We got there on week days in winter. Met groups of eagles . Red crowned crane. And other animals like wild hog and roe deer probably only place you will find so many bunch in one place. It is just nice to drive around since there is no fraffic at all.The cave itself has nothing much to see but still is interesting and in summer it is cool place to visit. Tall ones should definately watch out for your forhead"

So there was tasteless. If you visited there, I recommended to visit in warm time.Nice view of Hantan river and place to get some information on tour of DMZ. Walk down the stairs to take a better view of river- which is more like a stream. Just next to 고석정, there are okay restaurants which sells original stew of north Korean style and fish dumblings."

Can see the North Korean side but nothing is amazing or great. I thought it was rather boring. HOWEVER if you are in DMZ, gotta see it because it is probably the one of top three places to visit.This large and optimistically named ""peace"" observatory is located within the civilian restricted zone, so you must visit as part of the Iron Triangle Battlefield Tour. You gain access to the top of the observatory by taking a short monorail ride . Once there, there are observation areas with binoculars so you may see over to the DMZ. Inside there is a theatrette where we had to sit and watch a short documentary, unfurtunately it was all in Korean, so of zero value to an english speaker. After that we were allowed to wander around and look, however you are not allowed to take photos towards to DMZ area or military installations (you can see a military checkpoint and fencing). You can also see that there is no sign of human habitation in the DMZ, quite eerie. It was a very rainy and cloudy day so we could not see much but it was still interesting to imagine what might be there. Also on sight there is a small museum (all in korean) and a shop selling local foods and some north korean items."

I would recommend going to Garden of the Morning Calm if you are not a fan of Korean tele-novelas.A nice small island of commemorating the famous general Nami. Suggest spend a day here to thoroughly enjoy nature and different elements on the island.I visit the Name Island every year in recent years, usually end Oct./early Nov. This year the summer in Seoul was exceptionally long and there was little rain, hence the ginkgo trees in the city areas, including the Seoul Forest, had not turned yellow. So when I found out Nami Island still had yellow ginkgo trees end of Oct. (normally the ginkgo leaves would have fallen) I decided to go there 3 times over 10 days, to see the changing autumn colours. Fortunately I got some good pictures of chipmunks and of red squirrels. I had not seen a chipmunk at Nami in the past, as they were very shy.Went on a Monday and it's still very crowded. The autumn atmosphere is very nice with the cool refreshing air and colourful leaves all around. Getting there from Seoul central by metro is a bit of hassle and confusing due to the need to change lines 3 times. Maybe easier to go by shuttle bus.Nice place to visit if you have an extra day in Seoul.if you are fans of korean drama winter sonata, then this is the place you shouldnt miss... nami island still remain nature and good for a day trip..I do not understand Nami Island. Sure, the fall leaves are beautiful, but I do not think it is worth a trip from Seoul. It is crowded beyond belief and is some sort of children's theme park. As an American, I did not notice a general theme or anything of interest to me as an adult. There is just a mismatch of attractions from ostrich to troll sculpture. It was boring, touristy and not a cultural experience for me. I suppose it is interesting for a child.Must visit place for tourist who visit Korea for the first time. Romantic Korean drama Winter Sonata made this place famous.Nami Island is one of the places for Korean drama shooting, on Nami Island it is suitable to travel with a partner or family and suitable to come there during winterI went with a tour bus in October, and it was so nice to see the color leaves and Fall season here!!! The different colors of the leaves really light up Nami Island :). I would highly recommend to come here in the Fall--October to early November. At Nami Island, you can eat and buy souvenirs. There are some snack shops, as well as restaurants on the island. You can also rent a bike for 8,000 won for 1 hour. I did the bike rental, and it was great to ride the bike around Nami Island. You can also see many different statues, and the famous Korea drama statue---Winter Sonata. Many fans from around the world come to Nami Island to see the Winter Sonata statue. It's smaller in person, but it's nice to see if you are a fan of the drama. Overall, Nami Island is such a gorgeous set it with tall trees on the sides of the path. I love it, and sure would visit again in the future :)."

Maybe it was not a good month to visit because when we got in. There was absolutely no sheep at all. What made the trip nice was it snowed heavily when we got there on 15th March 2019.There isn't that much to see though I have a feeling a lot of people come just for the store which sells instant noodles at a super discounted rate. The scenery was pretty though and we took some fun family pics.Make sure you know when the bus leaves each location. The driver doesn't count the number of people and if you miss it, he'll leave you.This is sheep ranch and very big area and for family with children, will take about 1 hour plus to complete to whole area. But it is good for education and very nice view during winter since you can see a lot of snow covered the mountain and etc. Even you can feeding the sheep and etc. Beware that the entrance is about 800m walking from parking area. The charges for the ticket still okay and i could not remember but if not mistaken about KRW5000 for adult. Nevertheless you can always check the price online.Excellent place to see where your dairy comes from. Scenic pastures, mountain views. My boys enjoed meeting the cows and sheepThis is a pretty site where you can feed sheep. There are also some snacks available just outside the entrance. The fee is small so worth a short visit.Visited this ranch last winter and it was very very beautiful. We took a cab from Hoenggye and the cab driver agreed to take us on a private tour for KRW50K/USD50 inclusive of entry fee. There was no timeline so we took our time. He drove us around the ranch and we could freely ask him to stop at all the scenic spots for photography. Most the the spots were well marked so those wanting to have their photographs taken at drama locations will be very happy.Winter is not the best time to go for taking photographs as the cold winds were very harsh! However the winter landscape was undeniably beautiful...a stark kind of beauty. Definitely worth a visit!With such good reviews, we were excited to take our kiddos to see this Ranch. We went early this month and were not impressed. We paid about 30,000 won for entrance and only saw the ostrich's and a couple of sheep. The dairy farm was closed to visitors and none of the animals were out in their fields, but stuck in their little pens. Our kids were pretty disappointed. Be sure to bring food if you plan to go around lunch. The restaurant and shop has a lot of ramen and frozen beef and that is about it.Took the hotel shuttle bus to the sheep farm. Cost 2200 won per pax. Was around 20-30min journey. Entry was 4000 won per pax including sheep feeding. Was quite fun. Kids will definitely enjoy it.This place is very amazing not only as a ranch but as an entertainment. This ranch made by Samyang, which is one of representative food companies in Korea so that in this place, you can taste some food which made by that company Samyang. You can try Samyang's ramyeon and some dairy food before touring that ranch. In Summer, it gives you a free tour bus so you can take on whatever you want and the scenery was really great on the top of this ranch, personally. I recommend this place!The place is a great place to visit, especially if you're traveling with kids. There are a lot of sheep and Holstein cows. At the same time, there is also an ostrich enclosure. There are also wind turbines and the view is breathtaking. I like that there is a Samyang noodle store within the property that also sells milk and cheese made from cows in the area (or for the cheese, Korean cows at least). What is amusing is that they even sell blankets made from the fleece from their own sheep."
대관령 양떼목장,85건의<U+00A0>리뷰,강원도 평창 대관령면 대관령마루길 483-32,5위(79곳의 평창 소재 관광지 중),"This is a hiking trail which is fairly steep & sometimes slippery as as the walkway is covered with gravel > the walking course is circular & it is more slippery on the way down then up. this is a sheep farm but during our visit we saw about 50 sheeps feeding on grass in one sectioned off field & remaining field did not have any sheep except for about 20 sheeps in the feeding area. We were travelling with an elderly person & course was not suitable to walk together & the hills & trails are not suitable for wheel chair therefore had to wait in coffee shop. the admission price was Krw6,000/person including the grass to feed to sheep. Its good if you have children & want to let them see sheep close up & feed them but if you want to see large flock of sheeps then you will be disappointed. There is a good view of Pyeongchang area at the top of the hill. Its good for 1~2 hour visit.Worth a quick stop, come in the morning to beat the crowds. There is not much on display in terms of sheep, but a very nice walk trail is made within the park.It's on a beautiful grounds with plenty of sheep to feed. There is a nice walking course. Not the best for strollers.Feeding the sheep and seeing the views is the main attraction of the place. It is not expensive and it is a nice hike around the grounds. Kids love it.The views are fantastic. Sheep were wonderful. They are scattered on the hill. The sheep are the superstar but one can also come here for an easy hike up the hills where there are set trails. It's not as overwhelming as other bigger hills/ mountains are. With the 4,000 won ticket for adults and free for children under 5 or 3 (not so sure, but my child is 3 and free), it includes sheep feeding. Sheep are very kind creatures. This may just be not exciting for people who have been to countries that have abundance of sheep, but this is a great experience for anyone if you're in Korea. We visited during the summer. I wish I could be here in winter. Also, this is a good side trip for those who visit Pyeongchang for the ski resorts.Natural Beauty and scenic view of Hills is just amazing. Very good for natural lovers. Very good experience.Wonderful scenery. Abit of a walk up but so worth it. Beautiful way to spend a day. Bring a good camera the view is awesome!This farm is attached with another attraction : "" Making Cheese D.I.Y"", we were instructed how to make a cheese by milk, then we walk to the farm, there were a lot of sheep waiting for us to feed them, I personally think is ok only but my children love it. It was raining after visiting the farm, and was very cold.The landscape at the ranch looks quite foreign. All the sheep were out on the hills, dozing. It was nice to walk around the ranch going up and down. You can also feed some of them. I and my friends enjoyed the visit.I went there last August.Although it rained, still had a lot of fun.If you are planning to go there, I advise you to check the bus time table"

The water park is warm , clean and there is a lot to do. The wave pool and water park were fun. We really enjoyed the outside sauna and pool. The river, tube pool was a bit too strong though and I would say almost dangerous for kids under 8. It’s just rough and as an adult, I felt a bit seasick afterwards. Other than that, great fun. Try to get there either before lunch or just after since they will close in the early evening. They also close on Monday’s, so schedule your trip around that. When we went the cafeteria was a bit backlogged and took a while to get the food so possibly order 30 minutes before you think your kids will get hungry. The water park was a highlight of our trip for our kids so I would recommend it.It's a great water park. I thought it was going to be very cold during winter. I was wrong. The park was warm and the water was just nice. There's a lot of things to play inside. Slides, tubes and a fake wave pool too. Very clean. There's personnels around the area to assist you after you slide down into the pool.It's just beside the Alpensia Pyeongchang Ski resort. Walking distance to the ski area and Holiday Inn Hotel.There's place for lockers, showers and a shop selling swimwear & gears if you've forgotten to bring yours.My kids enjoyed it so much. Mind you it's during winter some more. Just awesome!Facility is fine but over charged . After the main entrance fee , you have to rent a life vest and cap (this is mandatory, regardless your swimming ability ) , and rent a lounge chair if you want to sit on the side to watch your kids.Stayed at the Intercontinental for 4 nights during the winter months mainly for skiing. This water fun park is a great break from skiing when the kids were a bit tired of skiing. It's not the greatest I've been but quite good with about 5-6 areas with different rides with floats and tires. My favorite was being able to swim outdoors in warm water when it's like -5C outside, almost like the onsens in Japan. We went after day skiing about 5pm and stayed till 8pm which was really plenty of action for kids to exert whatever energy they had after skiing. Slept well that night!!Spent an hour with my year old daughter. Facilty is modern and clean. Difficult to navigate if you do not speak Korean however staff are exceptionally friendly and really try to help. Park is advertised as one of the largest in Korea however actually quite small. Fortunately not that crowded so you can easily have multiple goes on the water slides. Tornado four person rubber ring slide is a must try..my daughter loved it.We spent a fun hour there, however could not imagine spending much longer.Though it is in winter, the waterpark can still give you fun. The water is warm with spa, made you relax and relief. It was also suitable for kids with a few slides. Feeling good when you go outside of the waterpark especially in winter time, so enjoying.Since it is not crowded, no need to queue up for most of the water rides. Water can be warmer, but overall very good. Changing room is super clean.Small indoor park with few slides but provided good fun away from the slopes for the children. Its heated, so its nice and warm although its snowing outside.Theres also a korean sauna at the top level where one need to be fully undressed to enter.Theres stalls serving udon, burgers, fried chicken, rice, etc. Enough to keep rumbling tummies happy.Recommend for family with kids if you are visiting Alpensia.Great indoor waterpark and small part of it is open to air and especially good during winter, discount for hotel guest and please show your room keyIt is good for adult but not good for kid who height lower 120cm. Because all faculty is not for kids. The price of ticket is quite high but guest of hotel have 30% discount."

We picked the Green Condo as we wanted the whole family of 4 to stay together. We would have to book two rooms if we chose the hotel. The ski resort is huge. With hotel, condo, villa and youth hostel. We picked the room of 99m2 which had one room with two beds and another room with tatami. With a small kitchen we were able to cook some simple breakfast. No room service, not much toiletries for condo. 5 mins walk to the ski rentals/lift ticket office. Good mix of slopes of different levels. Snow honestly not very good this year cos not cold and no new snow. Quite icy. Nite ski was good as no queue for lifts. English speaking ski / snowboard coaches available and friendly. Waterpark, bowling, spa n sauna, arcade avail. The waterpark is only good for very small kids. Don’t waste money if your kids are older. Can go to the sauna to enjoy hot-spring which is much cheaper. Bowling is good value of money. Restaurants ok. More choices if you walk out of the resort. 5-10 mins walk. Facilities overall i would say excellent in terms of convenience and variety but cleanliness and service level average. Would be good if staff can speak a bit more english.Top of the class ski resort where the Winter Olympic was held here recently. Ski track is very spacious, offering breathtaking view. Should spend the whole day here, at least.We (European family with 6 and 4 yo) spent 1 week in PyeongChang over Christmas 2018 and had a fabulous holiday. Phoenix was for us logistically easier than Japan (Flew into Seoul Incheon and pre-booked a shuttle service to PyeongChang which took 2,5 hours). The kids took skilessons at the Foreigner Skischool and the resort provides ample beginner slopes, great fun!! My husband and I enjoyed the advanced slopes and were OK with the fact that the resort has only few slopes for us. Each kid went with their own instructor as level was uncomparable and there were not enough non-Korean kids to form a class. Compared to a week skiclass in Europe for kids, it is pricy as many Koreans take lessons by the hour and the price is calculated by just summing up hourly rates. Their development in 1 week was tremendous however and most importantly they had a lot of fun. We took lunch at the food court: choice of 6 dishes, affordable and more than enough, it is quick but has little atmosphere. We enjoyed the americano coffee at the NY coffee and hotdog truck at the foot of the slopes. There is no such thing as a village bus service. You have to walk or take a taxi if your accomodation is not right at the foot of the mountain where the few restaurants and bars are. Not ideal when you have little kids as a bit isolated to our appartment in the morning and evenings, however the price difference between our appartment in Story residence and the hotels at the foot of the mountain was a factor 1:4. All in all, great week of ski <U+2600><U+FE0F>Phoenix Park is very well kept. The snow is mostly artificial but the grounds crew does a great job maintaining it. It can get icy. To me, the best thing is night boarding. 2200-0400. It helps saves time in your busy weekend schedule, but of course, it gets really cold at night. If you're looking for stuff to do or restaurants to go eat out at, good luck, because you're not going to find anything. The ski resort is basically located in the middle of nowhere. During my first years living in Korea I had a season pass but now would rather go to High1 Resort because it snows there often and has a bit more to offer outside the resort. Phoenix Park is small, but that means you get a lot of runs in. It can be crowded but the lift lines move quickly. Panorama Slope is my favorite.It was my first time at a ski resort in Korea. Apparently there were many choices available but we were brought to this one by our tour guide. The hotel was just located below the ski resort and it was easy for us. The rental of the ski shoes was also done within the compound. Overall a nice experience and great views at the top!The Phoenix Snow Park is surrounded by good places to ski and it now joins the Pantheon of Ski Resort venues that have hosted an Olympics.1) Fly to Seoul.2) Head to Seoul Station. Take KTX to Pyeongchang or rent a car. The road can be slippery after snowfall. Take 4wd if you plan to drive around Pyeongchang.3) Best to stay in the ski resort to maximise time on the slope. We stay at the nearby AirBnB.4) There are 3 ski resorts around Pyeongchang. We recommend Phoenix due to trainer availability. *Don’t pay for the ski park entry yet, It’s for the lift. You probably not ready for Beginner slope on the 1st day. * Take 2 hours class. It’s worth it even if this is just 1 off - bucket list thing. The class make the next 2-4 hours on the slope more enjoyable.5) Schedule a class before arrival or in our case we just walk in and book 2 hours afternoon class for 5 people. If you don’t speak Korean, you have to book private class with 1 trainer.6) Come early, take gondola to the mountain top. Have some hot chocolate, throw some snowballs before the class.7) Allow 1 hour for prep to pick up ski set - ski, shoes and poles. Helmet & goggles are optional but they keeps your head warm. * The shoes are uncomfortable. The ski set are heavy.8) Today class is about how to slow down (without falling down too much ).There you go. That’s pyeongchang 1 day. Scheduled it to happenI'm a skier, but did not ski this trip. I went for the Olympics and saw two events at Phoenix Park (also known as Bokwang Snow Park) a ski resort in South Korea. It is located in the township of Bongpyeong-myeon, in the county of Pyeongchang. Note: Pyeongchang is a county, not a city. The area was all decked out for the Olympics, but the mountain still looked inviting with a variety of ski slopes to entice beginners to upper intermediates. New hotel construction in the area will offer ""front door"" service to chairlifts. Other accommodations in the area are readily available and numerous ski rental places. Note: Koreans seem to all rent skis, not own. By KTX train, the nearest station is Pyeongchang with easy taxi service to hotels and the resort. The resort also has a bowling alley, ""food court"", spa, billard parlor and although closed in the winter, there is a big water park. The winter visit was great, but I'd also enjoy seeing the area in a different season.We visited this place in early March 2018 Most of the events for the ski had ended. We had great enjoyment as we were the only visitors there at this time.We went to watch the Ski half pipe and of all the events we watched this was definitely one of our favourites. I am not sure whether the Olympic facilities will remain after the Olympics,, but I sincerely hope they do to provide young Koreans with the inspiration to follow in the footsteps of their successful athletes."

홍천 은행나무 숲,10건의<U+00A0>리뷰,강원도 홍천 내면 광원리 686-4,4위(21곳의 홍천 소재 관광지 중),"A small and private place. They say that this is a private place own by a rich man who created this for the enjoyment of his ill wife. The ginkgo trees are planted bh him and only open in October. We were not lucky when we went there because the leaves of the ginkgo trees alhave already fallen due to rains the previous days. It was compensated by the colors of the trees/leaves at the entrance though.Hongcheon ginkgo forest is a hidden gem because it is not open to the public except in the first 3 weeks of Oct. (approx. period) when the ginkgo trees turn into a beautiful yellow colour. The map coordinates are: 37°41'49.0""N 127°53'19.3""E and one has to join a local tour (in Seoul) to go there, as it is quite remote (3-4 hours drive from Seoul city). I went there in early Oct. and only the rear part of the forest has turned yellow. Nevertheless it was a great place to visit. The ginkgo forest which had been strictly closed to the public for 25 years starting in 1985, has been allowing free admission during a designated 20-day period in October. Located at the far eastern end of Hongcheon County, the ginkgo forest is lined with around 2,000 ginkgo trees planted at intervals of 5 metres. In Oct., the ginkgo leaves turn yellow and create an unforgettable scene. Near the ginkgo tree forest, visitors can try local specialties sold by local residents.The best time to visit the ginkgo forest is mid Oct. This forest is probably the best place to see ginkgo trees in S. Korea."

알파카월드,26건의<U+00A0>리뷰,강원도 홍천 화촌면 풍천리 310,2위(21곳의 홍천 소재 관광지 중),"There's no public transport to Alpaca World, so you'll have to grab a taxi from Namchuncheon Station (it'll cost around 40,000 won for one way). Do install Kakao Taxi as we called for a normal taxi via the hotline and it took around 1 hr of waiting time before it arrived. All the visitors there were the locals who drove there. I'd say the travelling time wasn't worth it.We took a day tour covering nami island and alpaca world. After Nami island we had to travel further up for another 1 hour plus before we reached the place. Maybe it wasn't peak season, there were only a couple other visitors so the park was very quiet. The alpacas looked very skinny and dirty - maybe their fur was trimmed during summer? The animals in the park were confined in a small space with insufficient space to roam about and they don't seem active and happy. In fact we feel a bit sad for them. All in all, I don't think it's worth the time to travel so far (we took about 2.5 hrs to return to myeongdong) and atmosphere was not a fun and happy place to enjoy as the animals don't seem very well taken care of. I would recommend to spend the time elsewhere instead.Visited this place by a day trip booked with Klook.We went on the mini-train ride with the help of a kind korean lady to buy the tickets, have our lunch (fried corndog, tuk-sausage stick), feed the deers, alpaca watching and also walking around all done in 2.5 hours. The place was much smaller than we thought. Definitely a place where the kids could run around freely and enjoying feeding the alpaca, rabbits, and deers.We were there in first week of April. It's about 3 hours coach ride from Seoul. Alas much of the attractions in the theme park appeared to be closed or under maintenance. There are still the walking trails which is nice to do in that cool weather, but still, we were there for the animals not the trails. Seems like we were there too early in the year and that May or June would be a better time to visit.Alpaca world was a great park to go too as there are a lot of animals and the alpacas r really cute and friendly. A good recommendation.It was a good zoo to come too especially seeing those adorable alpaca which are really friendly and cuteAlpaca World is a relatively new attraction in South Korea. A 2-3 hours drive away from Seoul, you might want to include this attraction into your itinerary if you’re into alpacas and other furry animals like rabbits and sheeps. There are ample opportunities to take really nice scenic photos and we highly recommend that you visit during spring time. When we were there in Winter, it was really cold. Having said that, children and adults will definitely enjoy their time here as there are opportunities available to walk the alpaca and feed them. Feeds and other adhoc activities like the monorail and walking the alpaca are charged separately though.It’s a valuable chance to meet so many alpaca here! We can feed it or even have a walk with it! Don’t miss the chance to come here!I had been there in July 2018 with my family. Although it is a bit far from the city, it is worth to visit and there are lots of different kinds of animals except Alpaca. You can touch and take pics with the alpaca over there. Besides, there is a train in the slope you must experience as the staff will give you a cup of food to feed the alpaca while you are on the train.Free n easy to Alpaca World is like go at your own risk if you decided to take the last public bus! 535pm (bus will arrived and take off early, stand on the roadsite and wait! Else bus will just drive off!) I notice bus number 3 drove by same driver, so if he is sick, good luck to you! Unless you can call a taxi, else there is no transport back to town! Nov is a cold weather, temperature drop to 2° and sunset is around 510pm. Something that not very tourist friendly is that the stuff will lock the makeshift waiting room (with heater) at around 5pm. So we have to wait outside in the cold for about half n hr! Aside from this, the park is fun and kids friendly (not suitable for handicap or elderly with problem walking), prepare to climb lots of hill! Highly recommended. My family have a great fun around the park for one whole day."

I am a foreigner married to a Korean national, so it is not my first time in Korea. This weekend we decided to visit Hwacheon Ice festival for the first time and totally regretted it. I speak higher intermediate Korean, so I thought that visiting the festival is not going to be a problem at all, but I was yet to know that staff here is judgemental and rude to foreigners. They just look at my face and scream rude english words, even though I tell them in Korean that I don’t understand that they were saying. Left with ruined mood and worse memories ever. I would reccomend choosing something else for your vacation, as my experience was not good at all. It is overpriced as well! If you don’t speak english, you should not scream random english words you remember at my face. I as you a question in Korean and you can’t even answer? Then, you should not even work there. I how Hwacheon Ice Festival will reconsider their staff choices. Until the staff is changed, I am not coming back. Ever, and not reccomending it to anyone else.Our group enjoyed snow sledding, ice fishing, korean snacks and grilled trout. The overall experience was wonderful.If you want to try a winter experience, I would recommend this ice fishing festival. Fishing on a frozen river is an exciting experience.The organiser have allocated an area for foreigners and staff are able to speak English so communication is not an issue. You are able to move around the area to try the different holes to get your fish. Each person is allowed a maximum of 3 fishes. Staff are at hand to help you removed the hooks from the fish once you caught it. After which you can bring your fish to the kitchen and they will grill it for you. It is a good activity for an individual traveller or a group.Went with my wife and 4 year old on our recent trip to Korea on a weekday and we all have a really fun day out. We booked the trip on the Funko website with Korea Tours and were picked up within 100 metres from our hotel in Myeongdong. Comfortable bus took about 2 hours to get up to the festival nestled in the mountains, where the activities were all explained by a friendly guide. It wasn't crowded and we tried the ice fishing, ice sledding, assorted sleds and the price of the tour also included a food voucher for lunch. Our favorite part of the festival was the indoor ice sculptures. It was advertised as 5000 won per person but the lady just waved us in for some reason and it was fabulous. A bit like a kiddies play gym made from ice. This one was a bit away from the main festival (500-750m perhaps) and a little tricky to find but we managed (It's right next door to the cinema). People there were very friendly and many stopped to try and talk to us. Highly recommended day trip if visiting South Korea.About 1-1.5 hours from Seoul. It's absolutely unique experience only can do in winter in Korea. Entrance fee is around 10,000 Won. For tourists and locals, our fishing area are separated. Will be given a fishing rod and you find your own ice-hole to catch fish. Maximum 3 fish per person. If you failed to get any, they will give you one during the exit. There are facilities whereby you can ask them to cook your fish. Price range around 3,000 - 5,000 Won. Other than fishing activity, there are more fun rides on ice, concert and few stalls that serve local food.Really well organised and interesting event for the family. Got our fishing rods and tickets then off we went ice fishing. My young kids 2 and 3 year old had loads of fun. After catching the fish we had them grilled at a tent for 3000krw each. Even if you dont catch any you still can get grilled trout at that same price so technically it makes no difference whether you catch any. Just really for the experience and fun. Great service, friendly staff and many activities available for everyone. An experience that shouldnt be missed.This ice fishing festival has been running for a number of years now and they have been able to keep up the momentum from year to year. The main activity is the titular ice fishing, and it is a great activity. There are also restaurants on the grounds that will cook up your fish. In addition there are plenty of other ice related activities to be had on the ice.We came with a tourists group of 65 people and we really enjoy this day in ice festival ! So many activites proposed there (ice fishing, quad on ice, hand fishing...). We appreciated the general atmosphere on this event even if you were so cold (-15 degrees). Super nice moment ! Thanks a lot to make us discover winter in South Korea !"

This 30,000 sq m mountain garden is quite majestic in its natural beauty. It can be accessed by hop on hop off your bus from Gapyeong station or Cheongpyeong station. You can also take a taxi right from Gapyeong station which is what we did and it costed around 30,000 won. The garden is truly beautiful during all seasons but my favorite is during the fall when vibrant colors mark the park like dotted spaces. There is a cafe and restaurant at the park and lots of resting spaces. Right in front of the entrance to the Garden they also sell snacks and local food you can take with you. Go check out this place, it will take you on a relaxing adventure for the soul!I'm glad to have visited this awesome garden during autmn season last November 16, 2019. I would like to think that this is The Garden of Eden. A must visit place if you are a nature lover.I visited this garden each time I went to Seoul. In spring there were lots of flowers. In autumn there were not only autumn colours but also lots of flowers. They really kept the garden in good order.The Garden was a pleasure to visit and walk. Landscaping and foliage are excellent. Soft soothing music in the background enhanced the pleasure of strolling and relaxing in the beautiful grounds. At Petite France, soothing music was also played in the background - seems like a common feature in parks... Petite France has lots of French-inspired (as its name implies) architecture especially images / statues of the Petit Prince which are a big plus for a fan like me!Re-visiting Nami Island was great (last visit 10 years ago was in winter) as the gingko trees were changing shade to yellow.Check with your hotel concierge for a day tour to Nami Island, Garden of the Morning Calm and Petite France - it's really worth the 130,000 wons (organised by Cosmojin travel agency, includes chicken bbq lunch)If you are planning to go here, you need at least half a day to finish walking the whole garden. Not recommended to follow tour group.I would prefer The Garden of Morning Calm compared to Nami Island. Not too commercialize and can feel the freshness in the air. I love this place!Love this beautiful garden! We came in the morning and enjoyed the cool crisp morning air with lesser crowd. The garden is perfectly manicured with lots of beautiful pathwaysGardens are beautifully manicured and well kept. It was autumn so the leaves had already started turning and falling. This place is definitely worth a few hours if you enjoy the peace and serenity of nature, even more if you want to get great photos and are a fan of horticulture.This is one place you shouldnt miss when going on a trip to Seoul. Autumn, for me, is the best time with bursts of yellow,red and orange complementing the spectacular garden foliage. Photos taken here are definitely keepers!After the congestion of Seoul, this is a welcome respite. Lots of nice walking paths, but there are hills. Definitely felt the calmness and peace. We arrived fairly early and noticed more people arriving later in the day. If you feel the need to slow down, this is the place to go."

Also the staff is very helpful, for foreigners too.We watched Kung Fu Panda in 4D at the CGV IIsan Theater in Lafesta Shopping Mall in Goyang. This was my first full length movie in 4D. The theater was a bit complicated to understand for us at first. My Chinese wife and mother in law couldn’t help me nor could my Korean father in law because he never frequents the movies. I got in line and spoke to the cashier but she wouldn’t help me and kept speaking to me in Korean. Finally, a lady helped us and told me that I had to get a ticket. I wondered if I was at the DMV lol! So first step is to get a number and wait your turn. Then ask which movie, if any, is in English. There was only one movie in English but it was also in 4D and that was Kung Fu Panda. It wasn’t my first choice but I’d rather watch a cartoon in English than watch a movie dubbed in Korean. Were so glad we were able to watch that movie in 4D because of all the action which made the very comfortable chairs vibrate and rotate. It was an incredible experience for all of us except for my Chinese mother in law that doesn’t speak English nor read Korean nor likes jerking chairs haha. This is my review and I loved the experience. Watching a movie in 4D at the CGV Theater in Lafesta Shopping Mall in Goyandg is a must!"

국립 과천 과학관,74건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경기도 과천 과천동 706,2위(14곳의 과천 소재 관광지 중),"Could barely cover half of the main exposition with our toddler. Most of the exhibits are targeted at school-age kids, but we still had lots to play with. All the information is in Korean, which was a bit of a problem, but half the time we could figure it out one way or another. Most of the exhibits are interactive and fun! Would surely come back for more if had more time... Could spend the whole day here, especially if also visiting the separate space exhibit, and planetarium, plus there's a park around all that.We absolutely love this science centre as it's filled with interesting exhibitions and hands-on activities for kids. Though 95% of the information was in Korean, we still had a great time and learned new things. Our children (5 and 10) especially liked the Natural History Centre and Advanced Technology exhibition hall. Too bad we were there on a rainy day so we didn't get to enjoy the outdoor area where there are spaceship, trains, playgrounds, etc. Anyhow, it's a great place to visit if you're travelling with kids and looking for something educational to do in Seoul.We travelled all the way here for my 4 year old dino-obsessed son. We thought it was totally worth it! Word of warning - taxis are hard to come by so you are probably better off prebooking your ride. The main exhibit hall was great - lots of informative stuff in English. They also have separate buildings for an Insectarium (which we didn’t go to) and a Space Centre (which we did but left quickly as it was all in korean and we understood nothing). There’s a Dino park outside as well with Dino statues which my son loved taking photos of.The place was big and there were lots of exhibits, but almost all in Korean and very little English, which was a waste because the whole place looked very interesting but we couldn't really understand. My six year old boy enjoyed himself though, since he doesn't read much yet. Koreans really put alot of effort into educating their young as evident in the huge Science Museum. We also sat in for the entire Planetarium show in korean (which again, we understood nothing) but the show was nice. We didn't know there was a large foodcourt on level 2, and went to the cafe in the train outside the building for some sandwiches. We went on a public holiday (Korean Election Day) but the place wasn't really crowded. It's a nice place to visit if the weather was hot or raining, but you'll have some trouble understanding since almost everything is in korean.This is my first time in my adult life to go to a national science museum, the place is large with many different sections. However it is best to go with a Korean Translator or someone who understand Korean, because most of the information is in Korean. It was fun to look around, but it will be even more wonderful to understand what is going onIf you have young kids they will love this place. Lots to do and look at. And great value! Even though most of the displays did not have English translation we still enjoyed our day out ( was a rainy yucky day) and was very easy to get to.Seoul, Koreans understand a lot about Kids education. this is an amazing place to experience with your people. How is life in Mars? Wanna be an astronaut? 3 to 5 hours would do.I almost skipped this place but Im so glad I didn't. It is amazing, most of the exhibits are in Korea but it doesn't matter - there is a massive Sci-Fi and Space section. You should allow atleast half a day out hereWe went there already twice and for children is a nice place. Many things to learn and to do and especially during spring and autumn good place to be (if fine dust in Seoul is not higher then yellow). Just recently went during the winter days and it is not recommendable because nothing you can do outside. Outside area you have huge trains, rockets, dinosaurs and many other things. Inside quite a lot about human history, space and universe and all the planets around us. Many things are also kept interactive and kids running from one to the other to try and see. Unfortunately most of explanations are in Korean only (Will check that out next time being home how is that done in our country). However newly installed electronic ticket booth does not offer English. That's poor. So try and error. At least the lady at the food court was speaking English quite well. Parking place available. Car entrance 5000 Won per car and entry fee for adult 4000/child above 7 for 2000 Won. From our point of view price performance ratio is excellent.Good place to spend time with kids.
Many things to learn and play.
But dont expect specialize and expertized things. Good for kids."
서울랜드,126건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경기도 과천 광명로 181,3위(14곳의 과천 소재 관광지 중),"This amusement park is older and dated but it was still fun as there was not really any lines for any of the attractions. You will notice that many younger children or families go to this amusement park however it is still good for all ages as there are rides for children and those who are older.download Klook and buy entry ticket which is a lot cheaper than buying at the entrance, you can do this even if you are already at the entrance and its great to redeem the tickets immediately. We went on Easter Friday but the park was not as full n crowded as Everland so way way more fun in Seoul Land.Very large park with lots of rides and things for the whole family to enjoy, its enough for a full day outing, many many restaurants inside to choose from for eating.This park is in the Seoul Grand Park area not far from the Zoo and has some really cool rides including 3 roller coasters. The nice thing about this park is that since most people go to Lotte World and Everland, it doesn't get as crowded. There's a good mix of rides with something for everyone.The place is suitable for both young children and adult. Many attraction can be played by all family members. The place is big enough for us to spend full time and play same attraction several times. The crowd was less than I expected and we were lucky for that. Overall, we were happy to get the chance to play all the attractions with beautiful view of autumn scenery along the way to Seoul Land by walk, or by sky lift from nearby station.Although this is one of the most convenient theme parks to go to in Seoul/Gyeonggi-do, it lacks a real crowd drawing ride. Kinda like Lotte World's lesser cousin.A good place to go when you have nothing else to do or are unable to go to Lotte World of Everland.the trip is nice to go down of the hill and the view is lovely .. you can see the park and lack and trees and mountingThis is an outdoor amusement park. Highly recommended for kids and you have many rides that you can enjoy without queuing for long.Many local food stalls within the park and you will not go hungry.This is a outdoor theme park consist of different kind of themes for children.  If you would like to have fun with your children, this is one of a good choose for you.  But it is a bit cold in winter.Maybe this theme is old already or maybe I came during winter, or maybe combination of both. There is really very little people in this theme park. There is so little people that I believe because of it many of the rides is closed or seems closed. But if you approach the rides some of them is actually open and the staff will return and operate it. (they seems to be talking to other staff which also their rides have no guest riding it lol)A little anti climax since the mood is so different from lotte world or everland, but a very good point here is that you can practically ride everything that is operating even if we came at noon time because there is no queues mostly. Only thing to note is many street food stall is closed so you have to eat at their restaurant, which is also empty, so don't come here on empty stomach.Everything is old and such don't expect pretty stuff, but during winter, they have ice sledge which in my opinion is the most fun ride and worth coming. No waiting time, can play as much as you want, I will not grade this theme park higher or lower than everland, both are as good, just different expectations.Very near Gangnam District in Seoul.Just show the Korean address of Seoul Land to the taxi driver and you'll be there in 20 to 30 minutes. The staff at the main Information Office at Seoul Land just before the entrance are very accommodating and helpful, and they speak good English too. We asked for a taxi from Seoul Land back to the hotel and we waited not more than 10 minutes. Great!"
국립 현대 미술관,48건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경기도 과천 광명로 313 (우) 427-701,4위(14곳의 과천 소재 관광지 중),"Large extensive grounds, interesting stores including one selling clothes repurposed from other clothes. The exhibitions were, well contemporary and I'll leave it at that.Why the title? According to their website, the museum is supposed to open at 10:00 on Sunday, when I got there the sign said opens at noon, which is a bit frustrating on a hot sunny day.Highly recommend visiting this wonderful museum. I had the chance to see a wonderful exhibition on Park Seobo and honestly I was amazed by it. I wish there would be a lot more discussion about modern contemporary Korean art.The MMCA is a beautiful building is worth to visit only because of its Architecture the exhibitions i saw The Korean Artist price 2018 was pretty remarkable.I used to be a frequent visitor to Seoul but recently have not had the opportunity to visit so I was excited to return to the city. Several friends suggested that I visit MMCA and raved about it. It was much less than my expectations. Building is interesting but exhibits were boring. Too much empty space to wander around. Perhaps it was the time I visited. It is quite a distance from even Insadong, although it looks much closer on the map.and is definitely a destination visit. I love modern art but unfortunately this is not one of the best museums I have found.MMCA is quite easy to get to, it's right next to the ancient palace Kyung Bok Gung. The area itself is artsy and even if the exhibitions are not to your taste, it wouldn't be half bad to just stroll the surrounding area after your visit to the MMCA.Anyway, I really enjoyed my visit to the museum, free entry for under 24s and seniors (also have happy hour offer for entry after 6pm) which is a plus. A lot of interesting things to see at the museum, suitable for those who want to take a day or half a day off from their shopping spree in SeoulA long metro ride and then 10 minutes bus ride on the free shuttle bus to get to this museum, so you need to have plenty of time in hand for a visit. External sculptures as well as 6 main galleries. Check what's on before you go to make sure it's worth the effort."" so awesome because the admission is FREE! Perfect place to visit especially those who love paintings, collections , and some unique arts. Great to know that some of the paintings and arts here have history to tell people. Best place as well for students and for the whole family ""This was a really nice museum and I was quite surprised to discover admission was free. There was a great variety of exhibits, which I really enjoyed.The grounds of the museum were beautiful, with a reflection pool where you could sit under an umbrella and enjoy a coffee and a sculpture garden.If you're up for a bit of a hike, I highly recommend getting off at Seoul Grand Park station and walking up the hill to enjoy the view of the city and get a peek at Seoul Land and the zoo. There's also a shuttle that runs several times an hour if you prefer to ride. Parking at the top of the hill is limited and looked cramped, so if you're driving I highly recommend parking in the large lots at the bottom and riding the shuttle!To see outside of the window
After I saw the paintings.
I soon realise there is.
Hold my breath
And feel.
NATURE.
Nothing's special
But tells me something.I'm not really an art person but i enjoyed my afternoon here. Getting there was EASY. After coming off the Grand Seoul station (line 4) exit 4, a few meters away is a shuttle bus going to the museum. It runs every 20 mins and the service is FREE.There is a large garden with an open museum with various installations. There's also a small snack bar for those who wish to have a cup of coffee or sandwich while enjoying the beautiful grounds.Entrance is also FREE for the permanent exhibitions. There's a ticket for the special exhibitions but i opted not to. I must say there was a lot to see and even if Im not really an art person, every form of contemporary art imaginable was there. From photogrpahs, to paintings, to 3D art, multimedia and interactive pieces.I spend around 1 1/2 hours walking around which was quite relaxed pace. Overall for a free trip, it was worth it.Also there a nice pond with tables and chairs at the front of the museum where once can just simply enjoy and chill and relax."
서울대공원,268건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경기도 과천 대공원광장로 102 (우) 13829,1위(14곳의 과천 소재 관광지 중),"The Seoul Grand Park has a good zoo and rose garden. I did not see roses in past visits but this time (late Oct.) the rose garden was filled with roses. In autumn the autumn colours are fascinating. However this year was dry and the summer was unusually long so the ginkgo and maple trees were much less attractive than last year. I like the park because it has a bird house where one could see various birds face to face ie not caged. The zoo is very large and has a wide range of animals.The zoo is big and nice, better you buy the package ticket wich incl elephant tram and sky lift. The only minus thing is there is not much option for food. Mostly sell sausage, teokkebi, and other korean food. So, if you want to eat other cuisine, bring it from home/ buy it before get in to the zoo. Oh, there is also 1 kfc outlet wich always full and dunkin doughnut before the ticket counter.We went there to visit the Zoo, we ended up visiting the whole place and spend the whole day there. The zoo is big and there is a lot to see. There is a sky lift that goes over a huge distance with amazing views. We did not expect something so nice - we were also lucky to go there in autumn when all the leaves were changing and the views were incredible. Definitely go even just for the sky lift ride - it was amazing!To access this area I would recommend using the lift as it provides an aerial view of the zoo. Within the zoo there are many animals on display from giraffes, elephant, lion, etc. The zoo is well- kept and the grounds are so pleasant to walk through. There are even some activity areas such as a rock wall and elephant trunk slide.We drove. Traffic was pretty backed up getting to and from the parking lot and Waze was directing us away from the parking we needed, beyond the ""Seoul Zoo"" parking sign, so we ignored Waze. We were able to pay for parking using our debit card, didn't need a Korean bank card or won. 5,000 won for a smaller vehicle and 10,000 won for a larger. From the parking lot, follow the crowds to get tickets for the Elephant Tram or walk 1km to the main entrance of the zoo. At the zoo entrance, buy tickets to enter the zoo. There are stroller rentals available, we were also able to use our debit card for this. 3,000 won, but had to leave ID there until we returned. Strollers were nice. The zoo grounds are beautiful. It was hot out, but I bet a trip in the fall would have been perfect. I was expecting to see a lot of sad exhibits based on other comments, but they seemed pretty typical compared to any other zoo I've been to. I thought the spacing was good and yes, there's a lot of walking, but it didn't feel like too much. My kids had a lot of fun. I thought the food/drink choices were good, too. You can also bring your own food and drink in if you wanted. When leaving, you have to buy a return trip for the Elephant Tram or make the 1 km trek back to the parking area (which is also the same as the entrance to the subway)... I recommend going, especially if you have kids! It was fun!Easter weekend travel to Seoul Korea and we knew we would have to visit the Seoul Zoo during April, my daughter loves animals and zoo's, we came here in Dec 2018 and it was too cold and the animals were all housed inside so it wasnt fun last time but this time it was amazing. The weather was very nice, sunny and cool, no icy floor, the cherry blossoms were still in effect so lots of people were still taking pictures, all the animals were out and about instead of locked in large rooms. Kids get in free so when we went there was many school children which was very nice to see them enjoy the park.The park has been one of my favorites in Seoul. It had been under renovation for many months but fortunately the renovation was completed when I went there in early Nov., 2018. The aviary was extensively altered. Now the visitors are isolated from the birds by glass panels. However some new species have been added. I like to go there in late Oct. or early Nov. as the maples and ginkgo trees create a beautiful mix of red, orange and yellow colors. The park is very large and I like the zoo most. To save walking, it is better to take the chair lift to the top and then walk down the hill. Once back to the zoo entrance I usually take the chair lift back to the main entrance, around sunset time. The view (from the chair lift) of the lake at sunset is fascinating.I love visiting zoo’s and seeing different animals. However, I recommend not visiting this zoo. I travelled 1.5 hours to get here, and I feel like my time travelling and visiting was wasted. There were many different animals, which was probably the best point. Each enclosure was small, dirty, and there was no sign of a zookeeper anywhere. Usually on my visits to the zoo I see many zookeepers tending and feeding the animals, but during my visit here I didn’t see any. Many animals looked sad and hungry, often eating dry leaves. The monkeys were also acting out at each other, probably because the cages were so small. As I mentioned, I love to visit the zoo, just not this one.I visit this park today and not much animals plus all the information in the park in korean languageAbout an hour bus ride from Seoul is the Seoul Grand Park with Zoo. It is a fun place for friends and families. The place is huge and so many animals to see. You will see bears, elephants, birds and a lot more. The entrance fee is not that expensive which comes with a free ride to the zoo bus and skylift. It goes uphill so you will get tired going up so be sure to bring some water and snacks to replenish."

광명동굴,94건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경기도 광명 가학로85번길 142 (우) 14341,1위(12곳의 광명 소재 관광지 중),"Sure it's a bit far (40 mins train, 40 mins bus) from most main tourist zones in Seoul, but this quirky little park is worth your time. Part cave, part weird underground amusement park, this place can keep you busy for an hour or two for sure. I see people talking about the walking/steps, but if you are even minorly in shape, it's not an issue (maybe a few hundred stairs total). We did a cold wednesday morning and it was almost completely empty. For only 6000won, plus another 3000 to go through a ""horror cave"", you really can't go wrong. In addition to the cave and it's few offshoots, you can also do some virtual reality (5000-14000won), climb a platform for pretty good views, and there is upcycle art gallery worth a quick wander. It's not that the cave or attractions were so good, it's just the undeniable uniqueness of the entire experience that isn't available anywhere else on planet earth.This is a cave park with some fun attractions, shops and foods. Very nice for a family with young children. A day trip from Seoul is available.- How to get there: Subway line #1 (heading to Suwon, Byeongjeom, Shinchang) from Yongsan to Geumcheon-gu Office. And there's a connecting 4-coach shuttle train from the very platform you got off. This shuttle train stops at the next stop, 'KTX Gwangmyeong'. Be aware of this train's schedule. In the worst case, you may wait for almost an hour. After leaving Gwangmyeong Station through exit #7 or #8, take bus #17 at platform #8-1. 10~15 min until Gwangmyeong Cave. Follow others after that. It's about 15~20 min until the ticket office.- Entrance is 6,000 won for adults and there are other discount rules.- It takes about an hour to see the cave. You will go until wine cellar & cafe and come back.- Gwangmyeong Cave isn't that tough to walk around. Seniors can finish even if there are some up & down. They provide helmets. But, these aren't necessary. The observatory is next to the cave entrance and this is the only thing turning down for seniors.- There are other attractions in and out. Additional programs for additional costs. These are mostly good for children.- You can learn the cave's history. But, this cave is mostly for entertainment having fishes, laser show, illuminations, photo spots, wine cellar, etc.- The food truck zone outside looked cool for foreign visitors.We had a really good visit! The cave itself was a very enjoyable showing, but I also enjoyed learning the history of the cave. We visited the second exhibit (better for kids, additional fee) “Rainbow Factory”, a hands on traveling exhibit and light and technology. We didn’t experience the VR (additional fee) but heard great things. We hiked up past the sign on the mountain and explored the upcycled Zoo exhibit as well. Food trucks and cafes on site. Water for kids to splash in.It’s my first time visiting this attraction. Visit was worth it. The light and sound show. The gallery. The Lord of the Rings concept . The dark history of its past. But just a gentle reminder, this is said to be more of a man made instead of a natural creation. Another reminder , going to the main entrance itself will be a steep uphill climb. And inside will require 150 steps each going up and down both ways. A small consolation is a drinking fountain midway. And of course some wine tasting at the end of the tour . Our tour organiser arranged a fine dining set up for us.You can tour inside the cave for 1hr...lots of stairs and cool inside, you won't get lost, there's a lot of guide too. Outside the theme park are food and gift shops, and down further you'll see a mini recycling park and museum.I traveled all the way from Yongin to see this beauty. Took the subway all the way to Cheolsan Station from Stadium-Songdam College Station (took me 1 hr and 40 mins). From Cheolsan station Exit 2, I walked a little to the left and crossed the street towards the bus stop and rode Bus 17 which goes all the way to the entrance of the cave (travel time is around 1 hour). Upon arriving at the main entrance, I had to walk upwards for around 8 minutes just to get to the cave entrance itself. Tickets cost 6000 KRW for adults. Upon going in, you'll be amazed how Koreans were able to transform a former mining cave to the attraction that it is now. Inside they have aquariums, light tunnels, a lake, dioramas, and even a wine laboratory!Be ready to go up the Stairs of Longevity. It's quite steep and I was out of my breath upon reaching the top!Kids and elderly people might have difficulty roaming here as there are a lot of stairs, but they have designated rest areas where people can sit.A must-see! When I was there, all the people inside were Koreans.Booked the EG shuttle to visit the Cave which is an hour from Hongdae. Must be physically fit to visit because it took us about 1.5 hours to complete the circuit, excluding the horror zone. It is cool in the Cave with impressive light displays. Initially, the route we took was mostly down the steps but there was a stair of longevity which was going upstairs and it was challenging. There were no worries about getting lost because staff at stationed at strategic points to direct visitors. The last point is the wine cellar and there was even sampling of wine. After this section, we u turned and. the exit was not far away. Didn't want to wait for the EG shuttle so went across the road to take Bus 17 to go to. Cheolsan Station to return to Seoul.There's so much to see in the Gwangmyeong Cave alone. They have a light and sounds show in the media cave, big & moving dragon sculpture, hall of lights, aquariums, wine cave and cellar, horror section, historical and information area, golden cave, etc. Just be prepared to walk up and down lots of steps and stairs.Modernized cave with entertainment , various activities, sightseeing with aquaruim (small), light and sound displaying on the rock facade, winding steps but not too physical demanding, ex underground lake with light illuminstions, temperature is cool as compred with freezy cold outside. Pink tall chimney is the landmark when reaching this cave themed park.I booked transit tour ahead from incheon sirport website, important thing is that you need early morning arrival and then quick go thruogh immigration, further your way out through the custom declaration and go to identify yourself-booking reply e mail at the tour desk between exit gate 8_9. It's amazingly organized , and much important thst it's all free including transportation, english speaking tourguide, admission fee and transfer back to your terminal.We definitely recommend a visit to this site: a testament to the will of the Korean people to overcome a dark past. This cave was actually a mine exploited by the Japanese during their occupation where Koreans were the forced labour to mine gold, silver, zinc and other minerals. It was later used to store dried shrimp and other foodstuffs, then left abandoned for forty years. The old mine has been converted to a tourist site as a cave with an interesting light and media displays, local plants nurseries, and aquariums of exotic fish - all in addition to relating the story of the cave's past. For me a hightlight was a New Age music and video presentation using the contours of the rock as a screen for the video - just spectacular!"

남한산성,29건의<U+00A0>리뷰,"경기도 광주 남한산성면 남한산성로 784-16 784-16, Namhansanseong-ro, Namhansanseong-myeon",2위(39곳의 광주 소재 관광지 중),"The World Heritage listed Namhansanseong fortress can be reached from Seoul in about an hour. Catch the metro to Sanseong, then the bus to the fortres. Set in the hills the fortress is a great place for hiking. The walls are about 12km long. The fort has several gates, crennulations and watch towers. A good half day out.It’s a little out of the way from Seoul, but totally worth the visit. Easy to get to as directions are quite clear, and in doubt you can follow the many elderly folk going there too. It gives you a different feel from the bustle of the city, and the air is cool and crisp. Lovely trip. At the base of the fortress there are also many restaurants and cafes which offer good food at affordable prices. Well worth a visit to do something different if you’re going to stay in Seoul.One of my favorite hiking sites to date...I'm loving hiking here in Korea, even summer time can make you feel happy...Nice view feom the top and you'll get to see the city view, if air quality is favorable, you'll see lotte tower too...It only took less than two hours to take the old walk way course. Hike for free.I combined my trip to Namhansanseong with a visit to Hwaesong, starting out in Seoul. All is easily doable using public transport. Since it was quite a hot summer day, I enjoyed that most of the ways to get from place to place is in the shade, the walls and gates are really pretty. If you have seen the royal palaces in Seoul beforehand the (reconstructed) Palace inside the fortress might be a bit of a let down. Inside the fortress is a normal village, you also find plenty of food or drink options throughout the paths you can follow. Besides the fortress walls and gates you can also step into a couple of temples.Very well maintained and marked attraction. Enjoyed seeing the various buildings and reading about them.I finally went out to visit this UNESCO World Heritage site, and I'm so glad we went. It has easy and more challenging trails. We took a bus from Sanseong station to near the top of the mountain to have an easier time. We walked to the North Gate and then up the mountain just a little bit to the West Door. We walked around just a little bit more before heading down. There were enough signs along the trail indicating where to go for what. Looking at the map was a little bit confusing, but the signs that pointed down each trail saying what was which way made it easy to figure out where we wanted to go. Be sure to eat lunch somewhere near the North Gate! There are a bunch of restaurants and cafes. We had a nice coffee right near the fortress palace and then a really delicious lunch of smoked duck, bibimbap, potato pancakes, and bean paste stew.Locals and tourists flock to this fortress and the city inside of it. Take the #52 bus from Namhansanseong station, or the #9 bus from Sanseong station.The city inside the fortress is filled with restaurants. The palace was recently reconstructed. This palace includes beautiful views from the mountain of the town below. There are many different walks or hikes you can take from the town to tour the fortress, ranging from simple to challenging.For a challenging hike, walk from the Namhansanseong subway station about 1.5 km to the park. Then, take another 1.5 km hike up the mountain in a beautiful valley. Locals come to this area to picnic, relax, and exercise. The route gets steeper as you go. Toward the top are natural springs you can refill water bottles from. At the top you reach the South Gate of Namhansanseong Fortress. This is the most photogenic of the fortress entrances. My 9 year old son and I did the above hike. From the South gate, we walked the perimeter of the fortress to the North gate, then down into the town. By the end, we were exhausted. It was a rewarding experience.This is made in Bakjae dinasty(7, 8 Century). Used also in Silla and Joseon dinasty. It is not tough at all, very easy walk course. There is also small palace where King stayed(need to buy ticket for the palace). We were lucky to have chance to watch the Korean traditional performance at the yard of South Gate. They said, every last Sunday of the month, there are some traditional performance for visitors. It is free.First of all, if you have time to see only Namhansanseong or Hwaseong(the other unesco listed fortress in the area - in Suwon), most definitely go to this one. The time it takes to get to either of them by public transport from downtown Seoul is roughly equal, but this one has more hiking, more views, more information, and generally more of everything. Do see both of them if you have the time though.Plan for a full day if you can, half a day if you must. The shortest suggested hiking route from the bus stop area is marked as taking about an hour.The fortress is in the provincial park, or the provincial park is in the fortress, can't really tell. Anyway, it's a large forested and hilly area surrounded by a wall with a village (mostly restaurants and cafes) at the centre and some pretty temples and military buildings all over the area.Tourist information isn't marked super well: from the last bus stop head towards the roundabout the bus just crossed and look for two small houses with thatched roofs some 200 m further out and slightly to the left. Once there you can get all the info about the area as well as buy tickets to see the fortress's ""emergency palace"" (guided tour in English at 14.00). There's also an info booth just at the roundabout, but here they only ask you how much time you have, hand you a map and say go this way and that way and bye bye.We came there for half a day, completed half of trail no 1, half of no 2, did some sightseeing at the palace and loved it all very very much. And we plan on coming back to see the rest.A bit hard to reach by public transport but totally worth it. The fortress covers a huge mountainous area, so be sure to wear hiking shoes. If the weather is nice, you can see a large part of Seoul from the walls. You can choose from among several walking trails. In the valley in the middle of the fortress there are plenty of cafes and restaurants. To get there, take subway no.8 to Sanseong station (not Namhansanseong!) exit 2, and then bus no.9-1. You can also reach it by bus 9 it takes longer and has more stops.Definitely worth visiting!"

동구릉,33건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경기도 구리 동구동,1위(17곳의 구리 소재 관광지 중),"Korean respect for their ancestors is impressive, well documented in the remarkable state of preservation of these Joseon dynasty tombs. There are apparently 119 burial sites for the 500 years of this dynasty, of which this site, ""East Nine Royal Tombs,"" is the largest cluster. Very impressive, wonderfully landscaped with stone paths connecting the nine sites.Donggureung means Royal Tombs of Joseon Dynasty specifically located together in Guri City, Gyeonggido Province maintained by Korean Cultural Heritage Administration.- This is a really good place to learn history and take a walk in a forest area.- This is in Guri City. Not easy to arrive for foreign tourists. From Dongdaemungu or Jungranggu, Bus #88, #202 and #202-1 get there. It takes 30~60 min depending on traffic. Cheongryangri seems to have a good connection from the other districts of Seoul.- Locating outside Seoul, this is not that crowded with few people.- The entrance fee is 1,000 won. And there are discount and free rules depending on conditions.- Staffs were really kind and friendly.- The guided route is counter-clockwise from the ticket office.- Built in a massive area, visitors have to walk a lot. There are benches and folk playgrounds in many points.- The stream passing in this area is really pure and clean. It's so refreshing to see fishes and frogs in the water.- There are 9 tomb zones and some of them have more than one tomb in a single zone.- The oldest tomb is for the first king of Joseon Dynasty and built in early 15th century.- They have wonderful ceremonies on memorial days. Those rituals will be interesting as well.- There is the only one tomb that visitors can access so close. Others are quarantined by fences.A little hard to reach but is worth it to be in the company of such a historic UNESCO world heritage site - the tombs of many of the great kings and queens of the past Joseon dynasty ... Honestly it amazes me how quiet this place is, I had it almost to myself was a little creepy. The scale and sense of history here is just amazing and to share a quiet moment at the tomb of the founder of the dynasty with no one around is a unheard of experience in Asia. Please if you have any interest in history make the effort to come out here for a few hours -You will not be disappointed as even if you are bored of the history, the natural landscape is gorgeous!Went to this place with a Meetup group and was stunned by the sheer magnificence and beauty!!!It so stunningly green and just...wow. The history and preservation of this place is by far one of the best I have seen so far.The people are so attentive to keeping and preserving these tombs.There is complete and open space of just fields of green surrounded by huge oak trees which from my understanding are the kings of trees.Our guide was very knowledgeable and you could tell he loves the history of the tombs.I was very glad to have made the trip although the humidity was a killer.This place is huge and worth to visit. We luckily went inside without paying but I felt bad for doing so; this place worth more than \1000. The design of the tombs was similar to one another therefore you may skip it after seeing 2 or 3 tombs. To reach this place was a bit difficult; we got lost on the way thereCC(2013. 3)Donggureung means east nine tombs. The size of Donggureung was bigger than I thought. In Donggureung, six kings and ten queens are slept(Joseon's 1st king Taejo, 5th king Munjong, 14th king Seonjo, 18th king Hyeonjong, 21st king yeongjo, 24th king Heonjong). Maybe this royal tombs area will be the biggest Joseon royal tombs in Korea. If you want to know about Joseon's tomb form, we recommend to go there because there are nine tombs!!This historic complex of tombs is wonderful to explore. King Taejo's tomb which dates back to 1408 is the oldest Joseon tomb, as he began the Joseon dynasty in 1392. Seventeen kings and queens of the Joseon dynasty are located here. The tombs reflect the ideals of the Joseon dynasty, and are infused with Confucian design and principles. Each tomb site was carefully chosen using feng shui, to locate the most auspicious place to build.Donggureung is perhaps the best place to see various examples of Joseon tomb design. There are tombs found here from the 15th - 19th centuries. The beauty of the location, as well as numerous hillsides make it an ideal location. The elegant, yet simple design of the tombs found here are pleasing in their intricate details and stone guardian statues. If you have only one opportunity to visit a cluster of Joseon tombs visit Donggureung."

It way out of the reach of the city! It is closer to the Incheon airport and if you have a transit, you may consider visiting but I would not agree with shopping there! Will have to cab it there and get a return cab to the closest metro if you live in Seoul!This small mall based around the Lotte department store is a good place to kill a few hours before or after a flight at Gimpo airport. It’s attached to the underground walkway between the domestic and international terminals that connects to the subway. Nice selection of restaurants including decent Mexican, Indian and Chinese.Its the second time we were here. I find tgat that its a very big Premium Outlet complex, lots of walking to do. There's East, West and Tower blocks. Able to find many branded goods here. However, there's too little choice when it comes to dining. This complex and all their food outlets znd restaurants close very early, at 8.30pm. Tough time looking for place to have dinner after all the shopping. Hardly see any taxis around, too.In this unforgettable trip, we have been to Hyundai premium outlet and lotte department store of Gimpo airport. Unexpectedly, I love HPOG so much. There are many famous brands and traditional Korean foods that you can choose. By the way, one of famous Taiwanese beverage shop as well. For instance, I bought Nike shoes around $ 60, which is really cheap compare to Taiwan’s outlet. Spend too much money- please be careful.

All in all a good place to shop if you are in The area.Terribly disappointed with GUCCI service ,the lady with her title MANAGER is a disgrace , poor English and poor service , she got irritated and angry when we asked her some information about the bag , she obviously didn't understand what we are asking and just keep dismissing us with YOU CAN REPAIR THE BAG AT GUCCI SINGAPORE . well I can do without a bag in my life but let's see if she can do without a job with this kinda of service attitude if she remain to be like that forever <U+200D>♀<U+FE0F>Outlet with premium international and Korean brand inside, with 3 levels and few gates. Few cafes and free wifi also....across the street there are H & M store, Uniqlo and some other stores. Tax refund applies for \ 30.000 minimal expenses. Nice place for shopping.Marvelous shopping outlet for famous international brands outlet I've ever visited.Name it....you can find almost all famous international brands there, say Ferragamo, Tory Burch, Jimmy Choo, Burberry, Prada, Miu Miu, Tod's, Channel, Balenciaga....and many more. If you can do camping.....just kidding, do so, as 1 day not enough for you to check in each and every shopIt's a new shopping area, so everything you see there are brand new. However, you walk outside to get inside individual retail chain stores. On weekdays there a few people, so it doesn't feel like a place for shopping. Also, I remember there wasn't a place to eat nearby (no restaurant). Overall, Hyundai Premium Outlet Gimpo is just an average shopping outlet center, for now.Don't see much review for this. Anyway, explored it. Pretty big and nice to walk around. The usual international Stores are there - tods, Ferragamo, Tory burch, Burberry, ck, etc.Quite easy to get there from Seoul. A quick subway to Gaehwa station before changing to a taxi or bus (number 16). I took the bus as there wasn't any taxi in sight. About 25 mins to reach there (last stop).There is even a kids club there where you can leave by themselves to play with supervision. Cost only 10000 won for 2 hours. Very clean and safe environment. Best of both worlds."

To there, about 30~40 minutes from parking area, it was good walk to us with fresh air and beautiful view. There had the cave Buddhist sanctuary that was beautiful. Good to enjoy nature smell, view and feelings on the way to temple.The temple complex itself is a relatively modest compound nestled into the base of a cliff and ridges leading to the six peaks that constitute the Soyo San (Mountain) Park. While it gets lots of visitors especially on Spring and Autumn weekends from Buddhist pilgrims given the attendant lore which stretches back well over a thousand years, it does not suffer from the level of traffic that afflicts many larger temples. The circular geography of the park allows you to either start at the temple or hike across the six peaks and finish at the temple. The peaks are modest by Korean standards measuring between 500 and 550 meters above sea level and can be traversed in between 2 and 4 hours depending on one's stride and stamina. Getting there from Seoul by car will average about two hours on Highway 3 passing through Uijeongbu and Dongducheon. I'm no geomancer, but there is an aura of serenity about the place that has kept me coming back since my first visit in 1998I dont know anything about this temple architecture but I love the stream and the cave in this. It's so beautiful and it makes the people feel the value of each moment clearly.I hiked to the four major points, some spots more scenic then others.The first point was the hardest to hike up, many stairs and hard to maneuver areas.Please be careful, I would not recommend children go with you. Some areas up top the maintain are straight dropping points.Stay vigilant and enjoy the views.This is a great place to just get away. I hiked the entire mountain in about 4 hours going pretty quick. Bring plenty of water and some snacks. Wear layers since u will warm up quickly hiking nearly straight up.This most serene spirited site is one that I will always keep coming back to that will last a life-time for me. My favorite time to visit is early fall when you get to see and view the beautiful different colorful scenery of Soyo Mountain and the surrounding area plus the weather is so serene pleasant during this time of the year.Koreans love to hike/walk. So this place is popular with locals. There were monks there when I went and the people along the trail are surprised to see tourists. The trail is well maintained and steep in many places. ADA is not a Korean thing. There is a cool restaurant at the bottom of this hill where you can get coffee before or beer after your long walk. There is spring water at the top so bring a bottle if you dont want to use the community cups.Must do if staying in or near the Dongducheon/Camp Casey area. A nice walk, very approachable for anyone even moderately physically fit. Getting there: I followed liljazz01's instructions to the letter and had no trouble finding the place. Seeing it: to be honest it was a bit further to the temple than I expected (2 miles? from the train station?) but about the time I was ready to give up on it, there it was. Level of difficulty: 2. There are stairs to climb, but they are sturdy and well-treaded and so not so treacherous, even in foul weather (it was 40F and raining when I went). Lots and lots and lots of grandmothers hike this trail. It's just a nice walk. For the dedicated hikers and more physically fit among us, there is a more challenging trail that goes up the mountain and for that the temple is just a startpoint. Why go: The temple itself is lovely but the real attraction is the scenery. The trail follows a winding streambed and when conditions are right there are waterfalls. Afterward, if you're hungry (and you will be), there are a number of restaurants at the foot of the trail. I can recommend the Soyasan, a fairly large restaurant serving hot pot-style meals, right near the intersection of the road that leads to the temple and the road that leads to the Freedom Protection Museum.If your stationed in Korea, have a day to kill and want to get a good leg workout i recommend this place. Lots of photo opportunities. Tips/Info:1. Cost 1000W to get in.2. Wear comfortable shoes and clothes. Hiking boots or combat boots recommended but not necessary. 3. Get there early if you want to do the longer trails.4. Not all trails have stairs, some have ropes to help you pull yourself up. 5. We caught the Taxi from the Casey Commissary and told him Soyosan Mountain. He took us there for 5200W. Took about 10Min tops.6. Bring water and snacks.Someone already mentioned how to get to Soyosan via vehicle, but it's just as easy to take the bus or train. The 39 bus will take you all the way there, or alternately, you can take Line 1 (dark blue line) to the last stop, which is Soyosan. Upon exiting the train station, go straight ahead to the main street, walk right to the first crosswalk and cross the street. You can start walking right and turn left down the first alley, go straight, then follow the street around. If you get lost, just follow the groups of people in hiking gear. If you forgot your hiking gear or want new stuff, there are shops on the way with super cheap stuff outside. I saw jackets for as little as 15,000 won and pants for 10,000. As others have mentioned, there are food stands and restaurants on the way as well, or you could pack your own food and bring some makgeolli (or buy some there) and picnic like the locals! Entry is a meager 1,000 won. Allow yourself 3-4 hours if you intend to climb all the way up and enjoy the surroundings. Make sure you are in ok shape before you go and bring water or buy some on the way because, although the mountain isn't huge, there are some fairly steep areas and you may need to take a break or two to catch your breath and hydrate. This is a wonderful experience and I especially highly recommend it to anyone in the area!"

If you come to Dongducheon from out of town, it's well worth yout while to spend the day here, with much to see and do. You can go up Soyo san, hike the trails, check out the MTB trail. Lots of nice little eateries and gift shops. It's especially beautiful in the Fall.The museum has artifacts and a lot of historical information about the war, great for history buffs.Definitely think the museum is worth seeing, but not sure it warrants a trip in and of itself. A good day, if you have the legs for it, is to make the hike to Jajaeam Temple in the morning, have lunch in town, and then see the museum in the afternoon. They're both right there together. You'll see the museum off to the right just as you head up the trail to the temple. If you just want to see the museum, then others have described how to get there. Allow 1 1/2 - 2 hours. If the weather's nice you might consider packing a picnic lunch and eating on the terrace just off the 4th floor, which allows for some nice views of the valley below.Was taking my wife to Soyosan and was curious about this area so we went into it. Taught us some interesting facts about Dongducheon and the Korean War.

There had several facility including bungee jumping, trail and performance area, etc. There was very good place to enjoy rest with family. The parking area was big, and 2 hours free. Only one demerit was some private tomb was located inside. It was certain that there was good local park.We went on a Saturday afternoon in Winter on one of the days that the sun was out. The place was overcrowded yet no one bumped into us as we took a walk. I would not say that you should go out of your way to see it. I wouldn't dare do the bungee either as regulations in Korea wrt to these things are a bit lacking.A quiet park, good to chat and walk by a lake but I cant really say this is a great place to travel out of your way to visit. Just make sure you stop by if you are dining or staying near by.The only reason we went to the park was to try their 45-48 ft. Bungee Jump!!!!! We paid 25,000 won. It was such an amazing experience!!! Whilst swinging, I saw the beauty of the park. So I got two prizes for the price of one. Beauty and thrill. To get there.

Baekhyeon-dong Cafe Street 10 mins away by car provides a better alternative and more atmosphere.Trendy cafe street looking like luxurious blvd. of Gangnam-gu.If money isn't your concern and you're staying nearby, good to spend time here.Many places to eat, shop and chat with friends and family. You can enjoy a number of different types of food from virtually all the world such as from India, Thai, Japan, China, Italy, Spain, and US.Maybe it used to be better, but these days it is just a short street with the odd cafe and western restaurant. We ended up eating in burger king and walked along the stream/river to Sunae station area to grab a coffee. Perhaps I was expecting too much or looking in the wrong place, but I much preferred Sunae for food and coffee options.4.5/5 would be the perfect rating. I gave it 5 because is beautiful should i say. Lot of coffee places and cozy restaurants. Some boutiques for shopping as well. Outside Seoul so there isn't much noise around. I saw this as a hidden gem to be honest. Would probably go back.Filled with many Japanese Izakaya restaurants and other expensive eateries. I would rather visit Jukjeon Cafe street. I would not recommend a visit to this street.This area is safe and has many cozy places to drink some coffee and teas. But the price is a little more expensive than other coffee shops. But it is worth to go to date with your bf or gf.아기자기하고 예쁜 카페, 음식점, 와인바가 있어서 좋아요. 조금 비싼 게 흠이지만 여친 혹은 남친이랑 데이트하기엔 강추인 곳입니다. 주차는 길가에 해야해서 주말엔 차 안가져가는게 좋은 것도 단점이에요 ㅠㅠThe title explains it all, since this is trip advisor i score it very low as there is literally nothing to do in this area for tourists, no local culture and horrible parking.

I went there by back gate, it was hard to walk because the road is inclined steeply. But there's atmosphere and air was very good. Around back gate, there was gate ball and badminton arena, and well-managed. There had good mood, but inclined steeply. So I recommend to go there by front gate.This is a great park for a nice stroll and view of Pangyo/Hwangsong city.  You can also see some Korean old culture and houses in the park.  I would say this is a hidden gem of the area."

수원 월드컵 경기장,94건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경기도 수원 팔달구 월드컵로 310,7위(61곳의 수원 소재 관광지 중),"It is a pity as there was no game on due to the world cup but we walked round the stadium and you could see the pitch from outside. There are quite a few sculptures in the vicinity of the stadium that are interesting. Apparently there is a world cup museum but we did not have time to look for it.I am currently staying in Suwon, and I decided to catch a game tonight. Great venue. Friendly staff who spoke good English. Food and drink was adequate and good. Very convenient and easy to get to. Atmosphere and crowd wonderful. Tickets nicely priced. No complaints ! A very good night out !Caught a football match here recently. At the gate, the cheapest tickets were 14,000 KRW (approx. 14 USD), but since there were lots of empty seats, it was easy enough to manage an ""upgrade"" once inside. The Suwon Bluewings are an entertaining team to watch (they played well in the one game we saw anyway) and their hard-core supporters do not stop chanting and singing. One can only imagine the atmosphere they'd produce in a high-stakes game with a larger turnout.One of the 2002 World Cup venues, the Suwon stadium is well-maintained and has good snack options (the chimaek is tasty). Would have been five stars but for my experience with the ladies' room. While clean, none of the stalls I tried had any toilet paper left (if they had any to begin with). So grab some paper towels by the sink or bring your own tissues just in case!If you are coming here from Seoul, the most straightforward way is via taxi (ask a local to write down the destination and address in Korean for the driver). The ride took about an hour and cost between 40,000 and 50,000 KRW each way. Taking the 1 subway line all the way to Hwaseo or Suwon is a cheaper option, but note that from the train station you'll still need to catch a taxi or bus to reach the stadium.Saw a soccer game between the local suwon football team vs another in the same tier & the whole stadium was really well kept. Great accessibility, shops & large availability of food & drinks.Transport to the stadium with subway or bus from Seoul was also really easy so that made for a high mark aswell.I visited the Suwon World Cup Stadium sometime in Sep'17. I had a flight to catch in few hours and i decided to make the most of the available time in hand. I arrived at the stadium and found that it was closed!! I realized that there was no game on currently and so the stadium was closed. It was a bit of a disappointment (Hold on , there is a happy ending to this story :-))So, I spent the next 30 minutes walking around the stadium, taking pictures of the exterior and through whatever opening i could find of the pitch and the spectator's gallery. At the end of my walk, I came down and reached the museum at the stadium and found it was locked. There was a lady at the museum reception and i asked her if the museum was locked as well. She replied that the museum was closed for lunch and would open in an hour.I casually told her that I was from India and i had hoped to catch a glimpse of the stadium, but could not wait as i had to catch a flight in few hours. She thought for a moment and told me ""Wait!"" and spoke to someone in Korean and I guess explained my situation. Someone came over within minutes and she told me ""I take you to stadium""!!I could not believe it! I had a personal tour of the stadium (Look at the pictures!!), I was able to walk along the sidelines and see the stadium, all on my own!! Of course the lady was watching me and instructed me not to step on the pitch :-)The stadium is well maintained. It is also the home ground of the Samsung Football team.I spent about 10 minutes inside and then she opened the museum for me. I took a quick look around, took a lot of pictures, and thanked her for the hospitality.Suwon is the city who has a Samsung football team. In this world cup stadium, you may have a world class facilities with fun. This wolrd cup stadium has several restaurants including golf practice range, swimming pool, health gym. within 30 min distance, you also can find out baseball stadium as well.Were here last week to watch World Cup U-20 match! It has good facilities, clean restroom, and even when you watch from the high-end seat the view is still amazing. The stadium also located in the center of Suwon with almost 24 hours transportation available. Outside the stadium, there is a track perfect for morning jogging.I first went to this stadium in 2002 for the World Cup, so everything was brand spanking new. Although subsequent visits were nearby, I did not go inside to see how it aged. Pristine clean, safe, and modern, it has all the things you would expect in a stadium of this category. For those of you who have never been to Korea, MasterCard and Visa (and Amex) are NOT the predominant credit cards used there. There are few places to get cash, and from what I remember there was only a couple installed at the stadium for these cards. Korea has their ""own"".Stadiums in South Korea are generally good. They have good facilities and well maintained. Very good place to hangout with friends.Here now its been 12 years this was a part of the world cup stadiums..its been looked sfter snd maintained very well."

Part of the 5km circuit of the fortress walls.The gate looks quite impressive from both the inside as the outside of the walls, although I have to say I liked the Paldalmun gate more.After passing this gate, you can get inside of Suwon Hwaseong Fortress and reach Hwaseong Hanggung Palace.
I guess this gate is bigger than any other gates in Seoul. It's good to visit and learn history & architecture.

수원화성,934건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경기도 수원 팔달구 정조로 910 (우) 16253,1위(61곳의 수원 소재 관광지 중),"Just wonderful on fine day. Great to walk around the walls, stop and see the towers, bells and view points. The marsall arts display is free and worth watching.It is easy to get there. Just need to take the bus from the suwon train station, or you can go by foot and take a look at the city.The long walk is definitely worth it. Lot of nice point o view.Suwon is easy to get to from Seoul on Line 1 of the metro. At Suwon station pop into the tourist information and they'll give you the info for the bus to the fortress. Once at the city gate walk round the roundabout and you'll see the path leading up to the city walls where you pay the booth, then just get hiking! The first bit is pretty steep with steps but that's the worst bit and the rest if fairly level. It's quite a walk the whole way round but worth it, if you get tired you can stop halfway and walk along the river back to where you started. A nice walk on a sunny day with good views and history.Travelling south on Seoul's metro system your will reach Suwon station. From there a short bus ride will take you to a major gate on the cities former outer wall. After paying a token 1000 won you can explore the walls for as long as you like. The walls and fortifications are in pretty good condition and run for kms . In places there are canons and structures where soldiers would watch for trouble. In most places you can safely walk along the ramparts but if you tire of that there are adjacent pathways. Well worth a visit and even better if you have children. There is plenty to see and it's well worth the effort.We went there expecting an ordinary looking place but to our amazement, the place is very big that it will take long for you to completely cover the whole area. There are rides for touring the whole area so I suggest you get one of those.Since you can access the fortress by subway anyway from Seoul, it is definitely worth making the approximately one hour journey to this fortress. It was recommended to me by a friend of mine living in South Korea, and it definitely did not disappoint! It costs 3,500 won per person to enter the palace area and the museums (though we didn't go into the museums). The palace area is worth exploring, and you can drink from the spring water there and see what Korean life was like in the 1500s there. After looking around the palace, you should head up to the top of the fortress overlooking the palace and the city. I also recommend walking a short distance away to ring the bell. You can ring the bell three times (once for parents, once for family, and once for yourself) and it costs 1,000 won. Then go back the other way and climb down. You can get a great view of the old wall, and there is a lookout point where you have to remove your shoes, and you can get a good view from there. Since it was early fall, we were able to see some of the trees just changing color and it was quite beautiful. A must-do day trip from Seoul!What an amazing place to visit. You forget how big and busy the City is that you are in the middle of. The day was cool and clear. Lots of amenities like bathrooms and food options.Suwon isn’t far from downtown Seoul and it provides a relaxing time combining history and nature (as long as you stay in the western/upper side of the fortress). It is better to bring a guidebook as explanations on the spot are rather limited. Nice for kids.This place is really impressive and very well maintained. It´s a walled city where the wall and all it´s adjacent building remain, but the inner city has been replaced with 20 century buildings. Most of the fortess is located on the hill, between trees (at least in september) most of the town is hidden and you can really make a trip to the past, when this fortress protected the innercity and the Hwaseong Palace. This place was in my top 3 of things to do and was well worth the 1 hour metro ride (don´t be mistaken, Tripdavisor said half an hour but this is not true). Take the blue line (1) or the yellow line (B) to Suwon station. There you look for the Novotel busstop and take busline for about 15 minutes (6 stops) and you are there. I walked the entire walled city and that is easily a 2 -3 hour walk, with many stops along the way, many photo opportunities and just in general a really nice escape from busy Seoul. Make sure to visit the archery site at Yeonmudae, which is a fun stop to practice your bow and arrow skills for only 2USD.Spent the day here as part of a group... we had the added bonus of a tour guide which I think was helpful to understand some of the history of the Fortress. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site dating from the Joseon Dynasty-era. Out visit started at the Paldalum and we enjoyed a performance by the Martial Arts Trial group. Interesting show and impressive feats by the artists. We hiked the short but steep trail to Seo Jangdae - (west command post) and Hwaseo-mun gate. The hilltop is not to be missed as it has a wonderful view over the city. We followed the path along the fortress walls - seeing the various gates and appreciating the endurance of the double-walls. The full walk is 5.7km (estimated at 3 hours) though shorter options and a fortress trolly are available. Covering the diverse areas of Suwon with this walk there are a variety of options to get lunch/snacks and drinks. I would recommend water for the walk as it gets quite warm with little option for shade. There is a nice rest spot near the Banghwa Suryu-jeong (North-East pavilion) with a small pond and shade trees. Great for people watching here as well... The Sundae Market near Paldalmun has some small gift shops with handmade trinkets and ice cream/cookies. There is an option to try your hand at archery near the Hwaseong Yeonmudae Post, just 2,000 won for 10 arrows! The Hwaseong Fortress is easy to reach from Suwon Station (exit 4) - maybe a 20-30 minute ride on bus 11, 13, or 13-4 to the Hwaseong Haenggung, Suwon Seongji bus stop. This is a great option for seeing some Korean history without venturing into Seoul or for a quick trip outside of Seoul to see a bit of the ""countryside"". I would recommend to friends, Families, and children would enjoy the tour - just make sure you are prepared to walk!"

I went into the Armani outlet and found what I wanted with no hassle. No one followed me around the store, no one hovered around, I could browse in peace until I made my decision. It was nice. The outlet overall is a nice place to shop. I love the Marvel Store and there are good restaurants for everything from date night to having a meal with friends and family.Siheung Outlets is a new outlet location located outside of Seoul. It is still on the Seoul subway lines so it is easy to get to though it may take some time depending where you are located.The outlet is smaller than others in Seoul but has many different brands and there are a variety of items you can buy. Both Luxury and normal items. The food court is a little bit of the small size for how many people visit but the food is good and priced well. Make sure to go to the info desk first and see if there are any coupons available for stores as you might be able to save more. There is also a large play area outside for kids if you do bring kids. Pets are also welcome and there is a doggy stay area at Molly's Pet shop if you need to.Bring your passport as you may be eligible for tax free rebates.Overall I thought it was a good experience and it is not too far away compared to outlets in the USA and Canada."

It is possible to travel there by metro from Seoul Station. It takes about 90 minutes to arrive to Oido. Then it is necessary to take bus (number 30-2) to go to seaside. There is nice walkway along sea. There are many restaurants with a lot of sea food selection. I recommend sea food next to this Red Lighthouse. You can choose the sea food which you wish and they prepare. It is quite nice experience for street food, sometimes raw but always tasty.We start our journey from Seoul Station at noon time. It takes about one and a half hour to get there by train. When arrived we need to take a bus number 30-2 to the red lighthouse. But we were so luck that a mini bus 11C arrive before the normal bus, and the stops for this minibus are much much lesser, so we can get to the red lighthouse much quicker. The fare for these two type if bus are the same 1300 won, if you have T Money, you only need to paid 1200 won, time to the lighthouse is about half an hour. When we get there, lots of seafood restaurant along with the dam. At the end of the dam was the red lighthouse. Lovely place to spend a day on it, you can feeding the birds, play fireworks and choose a seafood restaurant and have a good dinner.The area has a lot of space to park and walk around high above the roads. Many folk here walking with their loved ones and children on this Sunday afternoon. The lighthouse is a beacon and is very red. Great view looking over the harbour.Landmark of Oido. But this lighthouse is indeed red, and nothing more. You can take few pictures and that would be enough for this spot.Great place to visit for one day trip by rail. Lots to do, see and eat. Very close from Seoul. Fully recommend it.It's a red light house on a rather dirty looking seafront surrounded by seafood restaurants. There's a nice walk along the front with fireworks being sold in the evening. Don't expect to get to the Sea though as it's fenced off."

So I have been fortunate since staying here to have visited a wide variety. However, this park was a bit disappointing. There is a lot of construction activity going on nearby which resulted in a lot of noise. The park is not also particularly easy to find. Thankfully I was able to spot the turn off in time as not to miss it. In the winter the park closes early so make sure to arrive in the morning if you are interested in visiting. Overall, I wouldn't make a special trip to come and visit this park. There are many other more relaxing parks in Korea.I could ride a bike to this place along the bicycle road by foreshore. I enjoyed the beautiful scenery reed and wetland made, listening lots of birds singing and the croaks of frogs.I've gone here a couple times for weekend birdwatching although it's closed this winter to prevent bird flu. It preserves a small patch of marshland (most of which is being converted to industry in the Ansan area). Some of the areas on the edge of the park are a bit polluted, but the core areas are fine. There's also a nice exhibit hall. The nearby riverside promenade seems popular with walkers and cyclists, though most don't go near the park. Also, there's supposed to be a bus that goes there, but I've never seen one.It's a beautiful track besides marsh....

We went there just for some photo taking shots.As it was winter, the lotus flowers in ponds were withered. The water had also started to freeze.Nevertheless,the season couldn’t hide the facts that the scenery from here should be great during other seasons. We were here by joining customized Day tour guide. As such it saved us a lot of time & ease in traveling with group of seniors & teens with lots of diverse activities.Yes it’s a charming place, the side where the water is. And it’s not difficult to get those scenic shots that you see posted online. However, it’s not a huge area and other than enjoying the serenity of and admiring the pictursque surroundings, there isn’t very much things to do. You get the laid-back sort of vibes and you could choose to while away the day sipping a cuppa with your favourite pastry at one of the cafes there. We didn’t think we would need to make a special trip there so we wove it into our strawberry picking itinerary.We went to Yangsuri Strawberry Farm near Yangsu Station in the morning, had lunch at one of the restaurants along the way and took a leisurely walk to Dumulmeori which is about 700m away from the restaurant.We then crossed over to Semiwon via a connecting bridge and back to Yangsu Station before taking the train back to Seoul in the evening. The walk was seamless and relaxing although the lotus pond at Semiwon has become a wiltered lotus flowers’ graveyard. I’m sure it would have been gorgeous during spring time. Do bear in mind that there is a “toll fee” to use the bridge connecting Dumulmeori and Semiwon - KRW3000 for adult and KRW2000 for students.All these within a day at a leisurely pace and doable on your own. Was an effective relief for shopping fatigue.Here is the famous spot where the tides of two rivers(Northern Han river and Southern river) meet. Pure water and scenery is harmonious. You can walk freely for 1 - 2 hours. If you have a chance to come to Yangpyeong-gun, it will be a MUST-VIST place.This place cannot be judge by just looking at photos. What you see personally is different from what is seen in photos. Walking in the park and looking at different angles gives you different views. Great place to enjoy the fresh air and beautiful sceneries, lake, mountains, trees. Also, great place for drawing.Lotus Park, you can say it, but when I visit there it's was during March, so the lotus not yet blossom. But the scenery is awesome, my friend explains to me that was where 2 rivers meet together. We walk along the way, enjoying the view and fresh air.It's quite easy to reach the destination, walking from yangsu station exit 2, all the way straight to traffic light(saemiwon), turn right to cross the river and turn left into a small path along the river. Walk for another 30-45 minutes to reach the infamous photo frame and continue down to the point where two water meet. It's pretty amazing to see in winter, the whole river is frozen and we actually walked a bit at the side of the river. Worth visiting! The journey is rather long from Seoul but it's relaxing stroll and I would recommend this place for sure!Was in Yangsuri for strawberry picking activities. Coming here was not part of my list, but was glad that we decided to walk over from the nearby strawberry picking farm ( 10 mins walk ).Crowds here are locals which filled up this place. Mountainous view was absolutely stunning and breath taking. My mind simply wanders off to a llalla land.We chose a cafe and rest our tired soles. With such mesmerising view in front of us, seeping on strawberry shakes / sweet potato hot latte + a kimchee pancake to go with. What more could we asked for.Glad that we make a visit here! It would have been beautiful when seasons are in full bloom. * PS - People who are not able to walk much are advised to get a cab back from here to Yangu subway station. Maybe could get help from a information counter at the carpark area. We walked for at least a good 40 mins or so which was really tedious for an elderly.A local told us walking to Yangsu station which would takes us at most 20 mins, but we embarked on a seem like never ending walking journey back.Dumulmeori is the place where 2 rivers meet together. It has very beautiful scenery. If you visit during autumn, you can see colorful foliage with the chilly breeze.Two rivers - Bukhan and Namhan - meets at this place. This place is near Semiwon Garden. There are several cafeterias around there. You must experience the worst traffic jam from Seoul to there and around, especially on weekends.Feels so happy that we decided to come here. Its peacefull and beautiful here. Especially the lake and surrounding. We took a cab to go to the lake and walked after enjoying the view, back to the train station. A little bit far but we enjoyed it very much.

용문사,46건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경기도 양평 용문면 신점리 625,3위(25곳의 양평 소재 관광지 중),"This is a temple in Yongmunsan Mountain. Unlike other temples, this is very commercialized like a tourist site. But, the trail to the temple is really peaceful and it has an amazing ginkgo tree. Good for a day trip from Seoul especially during fall foliage season.- This temple is accessible through Yongmunsan Tourist Site. So, visitors have to buy tickets(2,500 won). The front gate is about 15 min walk from ticket office and the main temple is 30~40 min walk from the front gate.- The way to the main temple area is a chance to feel the nature and quite peaceful.- When we visited in early November, the fall foliage was in the middle of season. Really beautiful with yellow and red colors.- Main temple area is not that small nor that extensive. It doesn't take much time to look around. But, the old ginkgo tree which is more famous than the temple is must-see.- Not many hills nor stairs. Beloved by many seniors and entrance is free for them.- There were very few foreign visitors.We paid the parking and entrance fees then walked up 2km to the temple. But when we were there, most of the temple buildings were locked so we could not get it. It was not worth to pay full fees for seeing the famous ginko tree and seeing the temple exterior. Maybe the temple stay and hiking there are good. But there are many more wonderful buddhist temples and mountains in/out Seoul free of charge.Can be accessed easily in a day trip from Seoul, train then bus, although the bus stop is a short walk from the train station. The bus stops a short walk from the temple, you could follow the road but we took a nicer route through the wood. Walking through the wood there are lots of little things to stumble upon, such as view points and stones, there were also almost no other people. You approach the temple from above give a nice discovery feeling. Not as impressive a walk or a temple as some located closer to Seoul but a good option if you want a day away from the city. There are some eateries around the bus stop and a nice tea house by the temple.Nice temple in the mountain. Nice scenery, especially during the autumn which you can see the colorful foliage.One night evening program consisted ofLecturesHow to bowDinnerMore lecturesWaking up at 4am to bow 108 timesBreakfastMaking buddhist braceletMore lectures and meditation instead of short hike (because it was raining)Clean up roomIntroduction to food buddhists eat (and lunch)Tea classNo weekend programs for foreigners, my whole program was in Korean and I didnt really understandTemple and dorms pretty and in nice locationDorms cleaned (but not thoroughly)Garden behind dorm and sometimes can get veggies to take homeParking at bottom of the hill (15-20 minutes walk up to the temple) or you can just drive straight up to the temple and park at the templestay officeIts a little bit of a walk from the parking lot to the temple. Along the way the scenery is real pretty. There is a stream flowing along the path & makes for some nice photos. 
It's a typical Korean/Asian temple, very colorful.C1 ( 2013.3.29 )

여주 프리미엄 아울렛,62건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경기도 여주시 여주읍 상거리 460,1위(17곳의 여주시 소재 관광지 중),"A nice outlet mall locate about 2hours away from seoul. However while the place has wide variety of stores, prices are just ""ok"" with not much one can really call a bargain. Families traveling with baby strollers might have a hard time as the place is divided into various levels. I'm sure they have elevators, but they don't appear to be conveniently located. I suggest booking a private van to go to and from the place as going back to the city as it is quite a challenging commute via public transportation.Prices are good and can get real bargain if you search hard. Not many local brands though, so it is different from the others Korean outlet we been. Transport could be difficult and bus drivers not the most helpful onesThis outlet located outside a city. There provides many brands. I think 2 hrs is not enough for shopping. Price is ok for some brands, Some brands are expensive too. there has 2 shops of Starbucks coffee. I think the kios shops price are expensive.If you’ve been to premium outlets in Europe, then I would not recommend you to go to this place. Items were similar to the ones in Europe but the price is slightly higher for outlet price. But still cheaper compare to prices in the boutiques in Seoul. The place is quite far from Seoul if using public transport. The place is huge but still a nice place to go if you have more time in south Korea. But this is going to be my first and the last.It’s a huge space with plenty of brands. Mostly international known brands so it can still be pricey even with discount and not as cheap as in Europe or US outlets . But great bargains can be found usually in some sale racks with 90% Off or flat prices for the whole bin . Make sure to allocate 2 to 3 hours at least. Not sure about the food options but I saw some kebabs and we snacked on some ice cream and had coffee in Starbucks .I think you can find all brands but still the options are limited except for some brands such as Polo, Addidas... It has limited restaurants especially if you are not fan of Korean foodsLove it so much but unfortunately our tour guide only gave us an hour to explore..We need a half day at least to explore this areaIf you have been to other Premium outlets in US, you either have to manage your expectation or just not go. Prices not that cheap and range for shopping is very limited. Most shops are quite small and some service staff appeared bored and disinterested to serve. Not worth the travelling time of almost 2hrs and 5700won (one-way bus ticket from Seoul Express Bus Terminal). Save your time & money for shopping in myeongdong or Doota. Also, since the instruction to get there is not very clear. I will attempt to provide some info: 1. Go to the Seoul Express Bus Terminal2. Buy the ticket to Yeoju Premium Outlet from the counter 3. Journey is supposed to be about 1hr 40mins4. Alight at the last stop Yeoju and take a taxi (11,000won) to the Outlet. (There are buses but apparently it takes a long time and we wasn't sure where is the bus stop. See photo instruction we took at the bus terminal)"

한국민속촌,749건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경기도 용인 기흥구 민속촌로 90 (우) 17075,2위(37곳의 용인 소재 관광지 중),"Went to the Folk Village today (November 2019) - the place itself is nice (the Joseon style houses were well kept and interesting) BUT off season meant that every single workshop was closed (I.e. any interactive element of the village), construction and maintenance meant many things were fenced off (including all of the food court seating!) and the “entertainment zone” rides were all at an extra cost despite paying 20k won entry per person. There was basically nothing to do and the entire place felt like a ghost town; we were done within an hour. Felt like a big waste of time. I’m sure it would be nice in peak season but they should either close the park in off season or offer a discount cost if they are going to remove most of the entertainment for remaining visitors. Very underwhelming.Amazed at the good reviews here. Maybe coz there was a slight drizzle alot of performances were off. Even the exhibits where we were supposed to see craftsmen at their work, only a few supposed craftsmen were there. Took a few photos n left. Not worth the long journey here from city. Why do people spend good money to come here.If you're visiting Korea, a cultural tradition heritage stuff must be in your visit list if you're grown up adults or smart teenagers. No need to explain in details. Just take a time to visit to explore and leave cultural remark on your Korean tour.Interesting place to visit... gives one an idea of the old way of life of the koreans. Great shows at certain times of the day which should'nt be missed. Even the school childrenwho were there having field trips enjoyed the shows. Well worth spending time to exploreI enjoyed this attraction.This is a korean old ancient cuiture attraction showing how the things were in ancient korea.This attacted me much because ,we in India had same traditional culture and even today in remote villages.I took lot of photos.I WAS REALLY SATISFIED WITH THIS TOUR.A must see attractionTake the day and simply enjoy what the Folk Village has to offer. There’s tons of history and even though it’s crowded at times, it comes in spurts. So wait for the Korean crown to move on and take in the village at your own pace. Enjoy some scallion pancakes....Yum!Since I had a free afternoon on a business trip to Seoul I decided to visit the Korean Folk Village. It was an interesting afternoon as they have re-creations of a number of traditional houses, offices, and even a jail! Perhaps because I visited on a Sunday afternoon the place was quite crowded and there were many korean families and young people there. Particularly interesting was that a good number of the young people, mostly couples, we’re dressed in beautiful traditional Korean clothes. Now my suggestions. I came from Seoul to the Village by cab which was probably the quickest way but expensive. I decided to take public transportation back to Seoul since I had no idea where to get a cab back home. So far as I could tell, there were no instructions in the village on where to catch a cab or public transportation. There was a guide in English where this could have been explained. Even better would have been an information booth for English speakers. There was a free shuttle bus from the Village to a local station which I discovered on the internet but this ran irregularly. Second suggestion. Although there are a number of performances in the Village it is very hard to figure out the schedule for those performances. It would be easy for the Village operators to post those (in Korean and English) near the entrance.I am so glad that we decided to do this. There was so much to learn. It appeared that many families were spending the day there which was nice to see. We spent more time there than I thought we would have. Some activities for children, a few places to eat, and also reenactments take place. The grounds are larger than expected and there are plenty of photo ops.You can learn and understand the ancient way of life in this folk village. From the manufacturing of olden day tools , By Straw , iron, wood and the ancient farmers houses, land owners house and old jail and daily they have folkloric dance performances.A place to learn and understand the Korean culture. Include traditional costumes rental services. Learn about the old days Korea and various Korean traditional houses and way of living....Nice and valuable visit..."

Get a chance to see the well taken cared of lion, zebra, tiger, panda, giraffe, flamingo and many others. It's a theme park and a zoo in one beautiful place. You must allot 1 day to enjoy all the activities in the park.Younger outdoor theme park and safari compared to the 20-year old indoor Lotte World. Nevertheless, it is still very fascinating for young children. Located at a huge valley with several sections: young children section at the entrance level, cable car downslope with more thrilling games and safari at the end. Because it is outdoor, better go on warm sunny days. Weekday mornings can avoid long lines.Having visited few international theme park such the universal and Disneyland, I did not harbor any expectation on the visit to this renowned theme park both local and abroad; I was impressed. For the price paid, you get more, much more, very much the worth and value, when compared to the big shots out there. The park is vast and wide, the landscape are wonderful, photogenic in many possible angle and many possible perspectives. While certain park either only suitable for kids , or too extreme for young child, everland has activities and rides that are just nice for all age group, from toddler to elderly.There are actually some clue to visit Everland.It is suitable for family and also youngster who love challenging games.Let me share my experiences..We reached Everland at 950am but the queue outside the main entrance is super long and we actually worry that the queue after seeing that.I advise all of you to purchase tickets online first whereby online purchased is cheaper and you can actually skip the long queue.Then, if you are able to reach before 10am, first place you should visit is animal or lost valley first because they are alot of parents bring babies and family and their main aim is to visit animal.So first station we were actually queue for about 1 hour only. After that, we went to Panda which is no queue needed, then we went to kids zone to relax awhile first. Then we went to the Z Line which is the most popular ride in Everland and we managed to queue only 45mins. So please dont listen to others which taking 1-2 hours for all rides. That is not true. But please make it on weekdays.So overall is good, really worth to try it and have fun!Everland is a dated version of Disneyland. We went on a Wednesday and it sure is packed even on a weekday. Most of our day was spent lining up for rides/attractions. If you don't have the patience to line up an average of one hour per ride/attraction, skip this theme park. Not a lot of restaurants inside the park. Good thing you can bring your own food.Tip: Purchase your tickets online so you can skip lining up at the ticket booths under the scorching heat of the sun. Get a Q-Pass (express pass) if you can.This place is huge! It really cater to the different age group. The queues for the rides are pretty long. But glad there is a big garden for people who doesnt take rides. When we were there, the theme was Halloween and it was nicely done up. Heard there the winter theme is even better.We went to Everland middle of December 2018 (3 adults and 2 kids).. We enjoyed the safari the most. Animals were interactive.almost all Korean citizens use various discounts such as certain credit cards brand usage, online social commerce stores such as Coupang, Tmon, etc."

The garden is lovely and some of the stone sculptures wonderful. As a foreigner it was somewhat difficult to understand the art even if we had a guide. I would have needed some more pre-knowledge about Korean history to fully appreciate the museum. Still a visit there would be worth it especially during more beautiful months like spring or fall.Make sure you stop by to see Korean masters if you are an art junkie. They have an impressive facility, view and landscape that encompasses the work very well. I think its a place where you wont feel crowded, disturbed and may be a great place to enjoy a cup of tea and scenery with your lover or family.

이천도예마을,29건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경기도 이천 (우) 467-843,6위(18곳의 이천 소재 관광지 중),"I visited the village as part of an18 day Pottery tour for potters. The village has over a hundred ceramic shops. Some are kitchy low end pottery but many are of a high level of quality. There are Master Potters with permanent studios located on the village site and their work is something to behold even if the price is out of your budget. That said, all the pottery for sale is easily worth the price listed. Sadly many might think some prices to be overpriced but if you ever produced hand thrown pottery you will know the number of hours put into each piece and the many years to acquire the degree of skill to pull off such beautiful work. Icheon by the way is the original location where Celedon Pottery began and due to the unique clay in the region it is the only place where you can find true Celedon.Baek Cheon Ceramic was our first stop. We didn’t find anything in the store front, but when Baek Cheon gave us a demonstration, our eyes suddenly opened to a world of wonder and beauty. Also, if you find a piece that is not yet glazed, he will ship it to you. Such a great host. Thank for giving us your time and artistry. After that, we went to the Icheon Ceramics Village. Be prepared for pay a little cash if you like shopping. Great experience! Will go there again. A must-visit!!!My teenage sister and I decided to try and learn a little bit of Korean pottery so we tried out the pottery class here. It's all very basic. There's a small demonstration with the pottery wheel and a brief talk on the history of Korean pottery and their kilns. Then we get some mounds of clay and were free to play around and make our own ""pottery"" crafts.I wanted to try out the wheel but there wasn't anything but the demo. So we sat at our tables and made whatever we wanted. My sister and I made small jewelry boxes and we saw a lot of other women enjoy making mini sculptures and molds too. Afterwards, they take whatever you made and fire it up in the kiln and have delivery services available that you prepay if interested. But I wasn't about to pay over 50+ bucks of international delivery charges for something I made on a whim.But the experience itself wasn't half bad. I think this class would be great for family of younger teens but not so much on children younger than that. But the more I think about it, this class and trip itself may be good for ladies day out half trips. Also, the gift shop carries ceramics that are indeed beautiful pieces but they are pricey. So watch out before purchasing. Overall, it was pretty okay. But if you have other places to be, you can skip.Icheon Ceramic Village is a hour away from Seoul downtown. The place is nice for a half day or day trip. Not recommended with very small children. However many shops with quite some ceramic stuff. Big small cheap expensice. One beautiful vase hit our eyes but the prices.was a bit excessive LOL Just 20 Mill Won is not our budget. The girls may like this place for look around. But be informed that you will probably not find white porcelain espacially plates. Thats the wrong place.Han Cheon Pottey is owned by a pottery Master Craft, who was being awarded ""Master Hand"" by the President in 2013. [if this was what I understand correctly..]My mother, my 10-year old son and myself booked a 1 day tour to this Incheon Pottery Village, where we get to make our own simple item n get to draw on pre-made cups as well..For people who like crafts, this is quite an interesting experience. Most importantly, our English guide - Mr Brian Kim is a polite n kind soul. My mother could not bend her knees to eat with traditional Korean sitting (on ground) thus Brian tried his best to make quite a few phone calls for queries n brought us to else where with tables n chairs.This is a beautiful place to make, learn about, buy, or look at korean ceramics. If you book ahead, you can make them. Seeing the traditional kiln was hot., making art was great. There are several shops and a coffeeshop. Lots of ceramic statuary for photos. Outside in the parking lot there is a traditional eatery. To the right of the entrance there is a park with a Buddhist temple, walking paths, river boat rides, etc. mid October and late spring is a beautiful time to go here.We stopped at Icheon Ceramic Village to shop and look at ceramics. Many of the shops had similar items for sale. Yet, each had their own styles and different things for sale. I wasn't that impressed, but, perhaps, we didn't see enough as it was late in the day. Shopping in Insadong, we saw similar tea sets for sale for slightly less than in Icheon, so, I'm guessing that you need to be careful while shopping.  Several days later, my husband and I went to a Tea Exhibit at COEX Mall that had top rated Korean ceramic artisans and displays of their art and ceramic. Now, those ceramics impressed me! Some displays were from private art galleries. The ceramics were truly art pieces and some were made by Korea's Living Treasures.Took standard tour to Icheon Ceramic Village to see how they make celadon ceramics. Guide spoke excellent English; 1 hr from COEX to the village. Which is quite substantial. We visited two master hands, one of whom demonstrated throwing a large pot. The beautiful creamy light green is a favorite of mine; the process of making it fascinating. Total 4 hours. included ransport for guide, 2 tourists and driver. Was able to return to the hotel and catch a 5pm flight out of Incheon. Worked beautifully in my tight schedule.While the pottery village may not be for everyone, it did provide my husband and I with a deeper understanding of Korean culture! We were there on a snowy afternoon in January. My husband and I do not speak or understand Korean, and we know only what we read on the internet on the way to the village about pottery. We arrived late in the afternoon, visiting about ten shops surrounding a central circle drive. To the naive, the display of pottery was amazing! We were kindly greeted by all the artisans and merchants! After looking at many pieces of pottery (yes, most, but not all, were mass produced), we purchased a beautiful handmade pot/vase as a memento of our experience in Korea. The artist offered us tea, took us to the back of his studio to watch his wife carving on a vase, and showed us the fire shooting put of his blazing hot kiln! Even though we did not speak the same language, we sat around their little stove with lively animation sipping tart plum tea on a blustery day! What a treat!One other artist offered us tea as well, and another ALSO took us to her studio and showed us her process of making cedalon--- and gave is a ""cash"" discount on a vase!What I experienced here was about much more than pottery! While I suspect my husband came at the ""right"" time, I would encourage any curious travelers to stop and see the magic! This was a trip highlight for us both.Having experienced the high price of Korean celedon in Seoul, we boarded the bus for Icheon in search of quality and reasonable prices. Of the many store fronts in the village only one fit our particular celedon search we were looking for. The store had exactly what we were looking for and at a very reasonable price. The village was a charming place with many things to look at and experience. The kilns were not operating on the day of the visit but it would be worthwhile to make an appointment with a master potter to experience the ceramic process. After the visit we walked across the busy highway to have lunch in one of Icheon's famous ""rice restaurants."" The prices were reasonable and the meal was huge. We stopped counting the side dishes at 27 and gave up counting to attempt to finish the meal."

I didn't know about the ceramics works, but this museum made me admired with good works. There had many works by global artist. Excellent museum with beautiful ceramics works. And the staff was very kind to me. Recommendable place.Great place for viewing or purchasing Korean ceramics. We had the great opportunity to visit with some Korean Master Potters and came away with a very different impression of what ceramics is all about. The pieces here are beautiful, exquisite, and some quite expensive. But you can find some wonderful pieces items at very affordable prices. If you are into pottery or ceramics, this is a MUST visit.Best ceramics museum I have been to. Interesting Biennale work - wide range and lots of on site workshops. Lovely environment and just extremely well set out.Smallish number of shops, about 50+. Prefer Mashiko in Japan. If you hunt around, you can find something reasonable for $50. A good piece costs about $200-300. I took a subway to Gangbyeon, then took express bus to Icheon, then took a taxi to village. The express bus passes by the village. It goes into the mountains, then makes a right turn on the freeway, passing a store with large black pots, then a fleet of autos for sale. On return, took a bus back (bus is on the main road), but got off too soon,so walked back to bus station. Note that you have to stand by the bus stop to get a ride. Driver doesn't stop if you're sitting down. Ask your hotel to write down Icheon bus terminal in Korean so you can ask for directions or a taxi ride.Note: Coex mall is a few stops pass Gangbyeon and has good restaurants.I am an English teacher in Icheon. My school had it's birthday, so I decided to go to the ceramic festival. It was a great opportunity to walk around and take photographs. Seolbong Park is right beside where the festival is held and it is quite a breathtaking site in Icheon. I love going there to take photographs and take a walk.This place is amazingly beautiful and peaceful. You are surrounded by art. Located on the grounds is a large outdoor kiln and behind that a body of water. In the body of water are wonderful porcelain pots of various size and shape. the works of art displayed out side are beautiful. My favorite the the metal tree with porcelain bells. This place is truly a wonderful place to visit. You can see the cities passion for ceramic all over. On the mountain sides are porcelain places and the bridges hold ceramic pieces. You truly should not miss out on this.The newly opened art center at the top of the complex is extraordinary. If you have any time at all go to see this 'expo'My husband and I took a local bus from Gangnam Bus interchange (Gangbyeon subway station) and the ride was cheap and comfortable. You get off at Icheon bus terminal, and just hop into a cab to go to the Wirld Ceramucs Center. My husband and I thought that we could walk... So we did and enjoyed ourselves. But I won't recommend because it took over an hour and we were huffing and puffing. By then we spent precious time walking and were in an exhausted state of mind. But the Center made up for all the sweat!! It was gorgeous and I spent an enjoyable hour having a class (~US$10) on using ceramic chips to make a picture. The teacher made up for her limited English with peals of laughter and enthusiasm for her craft. I bought a cup made by a resident artist and took a pic with her. How meaningful to support local artists!My husband and I then took a cab to the pottery village where there were clusters of shops selling celadon at very reasonable prices. In fact be expected to pay as much as 60% less vs shops in Seoul. The creativity of the local artists are so inspiring... I bought heaps of work to decorate my home, and as gifts for others. My only limit was my flight luggage allowance and the bus ride back. :-) I think Icheon is the supplier for many shops selling pottery in town. So why not spend a meaningful day out of Seoul and take the path less trodden? Just a note that you should have lunch at the Center before heading off to pottery villae cos we found it difficult to find restaurants. Cab fare from pottery village back to Icheon bus terminal was about US$8-10. It will be useful to get your hotel concierge to write in large print the Korean names of the places, cos level of English proficiency kinda takes a dip outside Seoul. But I didn't speak a single word of Korean and still found it easy to navigate! Highly recommended."

Ребенок 1,5 года был в восторге от всех аттракционов. С ревом покидали аквапарк. Он бы здесь и жить остался. ОБЯЗАТЕЛЬНО иметь карту для обратного следования в Сеул. Наличные водитель автобуса не принимает. И не опоздать на последний в 17 часов. Ждать он никого не будет! Да и еще. Если заранее через интернет оплатить (попросите администратора Вашего отеля) на родном языке и сайте аквапарка и оформить один билет на всю семью, можно получить очень хорошую, до 50% скидку на посещение центра.Посетили в декабре. Отличное место для расслабляющего отдыха на минеральных источниках. Зимой на улице работает только бассейн с гидромассажем, купели с водой различной температуры и всевозможными добавками, сауна и пару небольших горочек (больше для детей). Помимо общей части, есть отдельные помещения для мужчин и женщин. Там разрешено ходить только без одежды. В этой части есть пару купелей на открытом воздухе, две сауны, бассейн и несколько гидромассажных ванн. Есть возможность перекусить на фудкоре, либо в нескольких кафе. Для посещения лучше выбирать будний день, т.к. стоимость билета ниже и народу меньше. Термеден находится в Ичеоне. Важно не перепутать и не уехать в Инчхон (где аэропорт). Это совершенно разные места. Добираться лучше всего на прямом шаттле с автовокзала ≪Тонсоуль≫: Из Сеула 2 рейса в день <U+2013> 09:20 и 10:40 и из ≪Термедена≫: 2 рейса в день <U+2013> 16:00, 17:10.Очень понравилось, накупались, ванны напринимали, на горках покатались, гидронамассажировались , в баньку, которая на улице, залазили несколько раз , посетили сауну, ну в общем очень здорово, с удовольствием сходили бы еще туда, наплюхались от души, народу было немного, что тоже не маловажно .По поводу народа, в парки-аквапарки ходить нужно в будние дни, т.к. в выходные посетителей бывает на столько много, что в бассейнах стоят, а не плавают. Входной билет (включает все) стоил 28 000 вон на человека. Мы приехали на первом автобусе на 9-20 уехали на последнем 17-10,Поездку в Термеден лучше планировать в будний день, тогда народу будет поменьше. Время в пути из Сеула до Термедена приблизительно 1,5 часа. С автовокзала Dong Seoul Bus Terminal ходит два прямых автобуса до источников. Вход около 30 000 вон. С собой иметь только купальные принадлежности. Бассейнов несколько (есть закрытый и открытый), плюс несколько теплых источников с разными температурами и добавками. Есть детская горка и взрослая горка (но в начале сентября взрослая горка почему то не работала). В здании Термедена есть один корейский ресторан и маленький магазин (где можно купить воду и разные снэки)."

캠프 보니파스,68건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경기도 파주,8위(50곳의 파주 소재 관광지 중),"Camp Boniface is a base with the DMZ. It is guarded by South Korean and US troops. Can only be visited as part of a DMZ tour, but must include the JSA. The tour guides are left behind and army take over as the guides. We had a couple of young American privates, who had to wear sunglasses. A very important political site on the Korean border.This is within the JSA. You just visit here as it was so interesting and like nothing else I’d experienced before. You can go into one of the small blue rooms and actually go into North Korea. The USA military soldiers were absolutely excellent.This is the main place on interest for most people wanting to take a DMZ tour - the opportunity to experience first hand the tension between the two Korean forces. It is bizarre and exhillarating at the same time.On arrival you met your serving military guide on the bus (we had an America soldier) and are directed to a large room to be given a safety briefing where you sign a disclaimer recognising that this is a war zone. After having the life scared out of you, you return to the bus to head into the JSA and the famous blue buildings. On the bus you pass through a couple of kilometres of the DMZ, seeing farms and people who live there going about their business.Entering into the South Korean administration building you emerge facing the blue UN buildings which traverse the border. You are reminded only to look forward and to only take photos in the forward direction between two distinct points. It is all very tense. You can photograph the blue buildings and the North Korean buildings. After a photo stop and a few stories of North Korean soldier's antics (which happens while the tour group ahead of you is inside) you are then taken into the blue building itself. Half of the room is soldiered by South Koreans, the other by North Koreans. The N Korean soldiers don't look real, rather they look like wax work models. However, look closer (don't get too close as you will regret it) and you can see them breathing. You can walk over to the North Korean side and officially be in North Korean terroritory right in the middle of the DMZ. A fascinating and slighty unnerving experience, and the closest most people will come to the North. Back on the bus you can breathe a sigh of relief that you survived and back at the main camp buy a few souveniers to mark the occasion.An absolute must do if you’re in Seoul. Make sure you book the JSA and DMZ tour otherwise, if you book the latter, you’ll be going back to Seoul at lunchtime and missing out on the most amazing experience. A guide on a bike tour told us that trips to the JSA can be cancelled at a moments notice, sometimes as the coach is pulling up to the gates of Camp Boniface, so the atmosphere is already a bit tense. Camp Boniface is the “entrance” to the JSA. As it’s a live border, the US Army are very strict about what you can and can’t do - clothing (see my picture for what my tour company allowed), a briefing, the security waiver, telling us when we could and couldn’t take photos. Sadly there were no North Koreans soldiers out that day, our US Army soldier guide said they rarely are when tours arrive on the South Korean side as they hate them, but we could see shapes moving around in doorways and behind tinted window.You are on the border for no more than 10 minutes but it is so worth it. Didn’t see the Bridge of No Return due to security issues which weren’t elaborated on. Such a fascinating tour which is equal parts exciting and nerve wracking at the same time!At Camp Bonifas, you’re getting incredibly close to North Korea. But this is only the appetizer to the main course. It is certainly of interest to see where the soldiers are stationed, but pushing deeper to Panmunjom gets much more intense!Named for one of the two soldiers killed in the axe murder relating to the poplar tree trimming. This is covered in the short film in the JSA buildingIt was a surreal experience stepping into this place as this is the middle ground of the ongoing war between North and South Korea. Although this is called demilitarized zone, this is one of the most militarized area in the world. Camp Bonifas includes these freedom houses (blue-colored houses) where peace negotiations are held between the two parties alongside the UN. Must visit for those who can.This is the sole reason why I booked the DMZ/JSA tour. It is all about coming to this location, and stepping inside the ""blue building"", so you can step into North Korea. This is no joke, you have to sigh a waiver form, you MUST bring you passport, there is a dress code, and various rules as to how you must act. With that said, you will be in the blue building for around 5 minutes in total. You will then step back outside and face the ""North"". It is here that you can also take pictures. But of the ""North"" only. No picture taking of the ""South"". When I was there, there was one North Korean soldier outside. He is referred to as ""Bob"". There is also a 10 minute briefing before you aren't to this site.This is the place where the South Korean/UN forces and the North Koreans are only a couple of meters apart from each other.This site has a great historic and current value. It really is impressive.Join a JSA tour to see it.We joined the trip that was organized by USO-Seoul which we can recommend. The trip takes you around Camp Bonifas to view the North from a distance. Further the trip takes you to the tunnel and the railway station. For the tunnel you must be fit to make the climb back up since the tunnel is not a full height. Yes visiting is worth and must be part of your itinerary when you visit South Korea"
도라전망대,228건의<U+00A0>리뷰,"경기도 파주 Jeomwon-ri, Gunnae-myeon (우) 413-920",3위(50곳의 파주 소재 관광지 중),"I went there as part of a guided tour. They took us there and we went to the new observatory up the hill. It's really steep. From the observatory you can see the neighbour. I have been lucky because the weather was good and I could see really far.This is quite sensitive area, you need to bring your passport or visa or ID to enter. You are not allowed to take photos of soldiers and military equipmentsThis place offers you a great view of both North and South Korea. You can observe North Korea Goengsan industrial complex. Beside the view was really beautiful.The Dora Observatory overlooks North Korea. it is near the South Korea propaganda village and overlooks the North Korean propoganda village. Look at the 2 giant flagpoles. A great place for people interested in history and cold war politics.Pretty special place to visit. Walk all the way up to the observatory and you can see into North Korea across the DMZ. Really puts the place into context. Great experience and very lucky to have been there.We visited the Dora Observatory as part of a Seoul City Tour of the DMZ. The tour of the DMZ is the most popular tour that you can take while in Seoul as everyone is interested in what is happening in North Korea.Dora Observatory is a modern observatory that allows you to look across the countryside to North Korea. What fun.Fantastic views across the DMZ and into North Korea. There are mounted binculars for you to use for free and you can see people working in the fields, North Korean guards at their post, the massive North Korea flag fluttering in the breeze You get to see the nearest city to the border and you can easily make out individual buildings and statues.After spending a day in the DMZ it was great to get such a good glimpse into such a mysterious and forbidden place.There are great views of the south from the other side of the observatory.Dorasan Hill is a high land of 156 meters above sea level. During the Korean War, this has been changed hands between the South and the North three times and mines were numerous as evidenced along the road we escalating to the Observatory. Here mainly is a view point to see North Korea closest at hand. Propaganda village and farmland of North Korea are spread just ahead, and some city area of Gaeseong , Gaeseong Industrial Complex and a bronze statue of Kim Il-Seung can be seen through a telescope.The deficit at this observatory is not 360° and also lack of illustrations for directions of point of interest at telescopic locations. Also, telescopes are too densely located without considering the enthusiasm of tourists.Nevertheless, hopefully these telescopes will became a redundancy as eventually Dorasan Hill will be changed, like Lok Ma Chau of China Hong Kong, no longer a tourist spot of Memories but to be an international exchange center.One of the highlight in visiting DMZ! It is on top of a hill where you can look at the North Korea land using provided binoculars. The view is breathtaking.If you are lucky, and the weather is not that hazy. You can see North Korean soldiers on the other end. This will give you a view of both North and South Korean flags.This is one of the stops on the DMZ tour and there are telescopes to peer into North Korea. Because the JSA was closed to us, this was as close as we were to get."

판문점,358건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경기도 파주 군내면,1위(50곳의 파주 소재 관광지 중),"This is the UN administered part of the DMZ. Access to the area is by a guided tour only. A dress code holds and a copy of your passport is required before hand. The tour is guided by a member of the military. This is the area where North & South Korea meet to discuss border issues.Came here on a tour and was very lucky to spend a few hours at the Joint Security Area. So much history and a very informative guide to take us around. Glad to have experienced it. Explains a lot about the place.On 2019 June 28, Trump said he wants to be here to meet Kim. This place all of sudden became world famous including DMZ . Since President Moon shake hand here with Chairman Kim Sept 2018, this location resumed as a daily tourist event. As a matter of fact, this could be more of a Political Site than tourist spot. With the tension between North and South reduced, and hopefully a Peace treaty be signed, this place could became history. We enjoyed more to visit Imjingak and Dorasan and hopefully in future , from there, we can visit Gaeseong Industrial Complex or even further up North to some nice tourist spot of North Korea.This place is also called the JSA (joint security area) and it where south meets North Korea. It is guarded by American military. You have your passport checked a few times and then get off your own bus and go watch and hear briefing on the JSA. You signs waiver saying you don’t have any weapons and do not plan to defect. You then get on the army buses and go into the JSA. You can see the giant flags as you go. The main area has 2 big buildings facing each other with blue buildings in the middle. The 2 big buildings sit in north and South Korea. Running through the blue buildings is a concrete line which marks the border. We could go into one of the blue buildings which meant at one point inside we were in North Korea! You cannot step across from the outside. We went to see the blue bridge.Our ‘tour guide’ was a great US army solider - such a cool and great guy. In fact they all were really approachable and you could ask them anything. We both felt that the JSA was a real highlight of our whole trip - well worth going on a tour here.You do have to wear certain clothing which if you go on a guide they’ll let you know.Totally disappointed. I felt completely misled on this one. The only reason I wasted a day was to see the compound. This wasn’t reviled until the very end of the tour (currently closed to the general population). The places you are bus you to are just simple tourist spots. Only one highlight was the overlook. They gave 20 minutes there and your bus is ready to leave. The 3 tunnel stop, a huge climb and tricky walk to see a rusted door. Was it worth it? Probably but still very disappointed.Here you find yourself just in the heart of the two sides of Korea, you can feel what the division is like. Unique experience.I took the Cosmojin DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) tour with a North Korean defector. This was to say, originally booked for a tour of the JSA (Joint Security Area).Although the tour went well, I found unethical practices from the company that offers a tour to the JSA when it has been unavailable since October 2018 due to security changes. The tour guide was informative, the opportunity to talk to a North Korean defector was admirable, but the business practice by the company just left lingering animosity since what they are doing is dishonest, by allowing you to book something they are unable to guarantee at all, with reasonable doubt that we would be unable to go to JSA during the time of the booking.I do not recommend Cosmojin.I’ve already written a review under Camp Boniface so thought I’d highlight a few things I would have found useful before I went;1. You will only see Panmunjom if you book a joint JSA/DMZ tour. Some people on our coach seemed to think it was part of the half day DMZ tour but it isn’t. The morning is the DMZ tour then the afternoon is the visit to the JSA. I would hate to be sat on a bus going back to Seoul at 1pm knowing I was missing out of the best bit. Some tour companies don’t make it clear so do your research.2. The dress code is strict and a soldier will check you. Tour guides have extra clothing with them but i wouldn’t count on it especially if you are larger than the average Korean!! That being said, men were able to wear shorts below the knee, small logos on polo shirts were fine, shorts sleeves were allowed as was round neck tshirts as it was incredible hot. I have attached a picture of the JSA dress code rules given by my tour company as it did stress me out quite a bit beforehand. 3. The waiver you sign before the briefing at Camp Boniface is given back to you on the way out so no need to worry about the legality of signing it. 4. The JSA tour can be cancelled at the very last moment for a whole host of reasons from the obvious security ones to dignitary visits. There’s no refund if this happens but you will be offered a transfer to another date as happened to me. There are specific days/dates that tours don’t run but the tour operators have this on their websites.5. It’s unlikely that you’ll see any North Korean guards facing off against the South Korean soldiers across the DMZ line. They hate the JSA tours and complain constantly about them so refuse to “participate” according to the US soldier who briefed our coach. The only time you might see them is if there is a tour on their side in which case they’ll appear. Notwithstanding all of the above, it is the most amazing experience so make sure you do it!!!You're only able to visit this area with specific tour groups in Seoul and it's a unique experience being at a place that is both well known and dangerous at the same time.There were no North Korean guards when we visited and we have to follow many rules like specific clothing and no random photo taking, but the trip itself was well worth it.Will strongly recommend visiting this place if you're into history and politics, but be aware that trips here can be cancelled at any time due to various reasons, so be sure to go with a legit tour company. Be sure to go with a tour company where you can pay only on the day of the tour, so you don't have to go through the hassle of a refund if anything happens.We went with Cosmojin and the tour company allowed us to pay via cash on the day of the tour itself.If you've done your research, then hopefully you've found one of the few tour groups that will actually take you all the way to the buildings of Panmunjom, while the other tours have concluded miles away. And by the time your bus has reached the exterior of Camp Bonifas, you've already been tantalized by a distant North Korean landscape looming on the horizon as viewed from the Dora Observatory. You've probably come from the Third Tunnel, where you saw absolutely nothing of North Korea.After a brief wait, anxious with anticipation, you are finally driven slowly past a sizeable fence into the Demilitarized Zone as you enter the military encampment. After a brief presentation on what not to do, this is the moment you've been waiting for! Tourists are driven out of camp down a narrow road, past, watch towers, barb-wire fences, and minefields. This is the last of South Korea, where a handful of farmers remain, owning land only through inheritance. Otherwise, this is a place strictly off limits to most of the world.Within minutes, you are dropped off in front of a large, unadorned gray complex through which you are escorted. It's a facility fit for presidents and diplomats, yet purely functional and completely undecorated. As you walk through the building in two single-file lines and ride up an escalator, you're suddenly there. Without fanfare, you've exit the upper floor of the structure where those tiny blue huts you've seen photographed and filmed hundreds of times stand right before your very eyes. But your gaze cannot be broken from the North Korean building directly in front of you and the very doors from which Kim Jong-Un occasionally emerges to attend meetings.After brief explanation inside the main blue hut, you step past a table marking the border between the two countries and you're now standing in North Korea. The experience is brief, a whirlwind event to be sure. But the memory of standing in the most mysterious country in the world will stay with you forever."

The park had wide parking area, and exhibits about divided country's history. There was a part of our sad history, and included many meanings. There was good point to walk around with many history, and could view North Korea scenery.It is great park, where you can see DMZ, mountains in North Korea side, no return bridge.... The park there was really beautiful. You can camp if the weather is nice.This park has a number of Korean War sites and is the first stop on most DMZ tours. There is the Freedom Bridge and the remains of a derailed trains. A bit of a tourist trap but interesting.Went here as part of a DMZ tour and saw a piece of history. From a demolished bridge, to an old train that was shot up and recovered in the area. There are several lookout points as well to look across the river into North Korea.The park is a bit of a tourust trap and it's most peoples first stop inside the DMZ. Nevertheless it has some interesting monuments and of course the Peace Bridge.The Peace Bridge was used at the end of the Korean War to exchange thousands of prisoners of war from both sides. Its blocked off at the North entrance now with razor wire and the like because of a murderous incursion years back. That only serves to make it look more foreboding and of it's time.You can walk the full length from the southern side as far as the blocked northern entrance. The best thing about Imjingak in my opinion.There is a beautiful peace bell and a lovely peace monument using stones taken from I think 86 different conflict zones throughout the world A train carriagecremsins from the line that used to run here before the bombs of war.I really enjoyed the whole place actually.A very interesting place to visit! Especially if you are curious about the history of North and South Korea separation. You can see the steam locomotive that was shot and derailed by bombs in the Korean war; the destroyed railway that was heading to Pyeongyang; the bridge of freedom; memorials of the separation; and a peaceful park that was built to console the families that got separated during the war.Still in the area, there is a stunning park with thousands of colorful pinwheels. Near the park you can find a simple amusement park to enjoy some thrilling rides.You will witness remnants of bullets during the Korean War as well as well-wishers that one day North and South Korea will be reunited.Here you can see the freedom bridge.We felt that the train here was fascinating - destroyed in the Korean War it was moved here so people could witness what happened. On the train there are bullet holes and the wheels are bent. There’s also a wall of prayers. Also a souvenir shop.Have you ever curious about how the relationship between North and South korea? you need to come here. in here you don't need tour to come because this place actually still not inside DMZ area. but in the border between DMZ and normal area. in here there is a park that so satisfying to enjoy your spare time....to visit this park. I think it would be a wonderful place to bring the family on a weekend as a day trip from Seoul. Quite a few monuments to see as well as an old train locomotive. I could imagine hanging out with friends on the little lake below the bridge - maybe a picnic. Why not? If you got kids, it could be educational as well. Maybe jump into Paju town afterwards."
제3 땅굴,339건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경기도 파주 장단면 도라산리 (우) 10800,5위(50곳의 파주 소재 관광지 중),"By some distance, the biggest disappointment of an otherwise great trip to Korea. The UN emailed us 24hours earlier to tell us that the JSA tour we'd pre-booked had been cancelled for some reason (happens a lot, apparently: we were just unlucky). So to salvage what we could from the situation, we joined the Third Tunnel tour instead.Dorasan station: a place where you just have to use your imagination, as there's really nothing to see/do there at present. The border viewpoint allowed a 'Cold War afficionado' like myself to get my fix, gazing across into North Korea, but the supposed highlight - the third tunnel - although it has an interesting back-story, there's nothing of interest once inside it.Don't bother with this tour: book the JSA tour and just hope you get a green-light from the UN. Enjoy!Explore the underground tunnel dug by the North Koreans to ostensibly invade South Korea. A motorised trolley takes you underground, where you walk the tunnel and can see the holes where dynamite blew the tunnel. Not for claustrophobes!included on your tour trip to DMZ, third tunnel is a unforgettable experience, no photos are allowed inside the tunnel and you can’t bring your cellphone, so be ready for a zero technology walking tour, there are lockers where you can leave your belongings, a souvenir and convenient store, then you go thru a metal detector. Downhill is easy, walking back is the hard part, unless you’re very fit, as it’s very steep. You can use the little train and I personally recommend it as there’s really nothing to see while walking. A hard hat is a must and very helpful, I’m 5’2” and still manage to hit my head with the ceiling a couple of times. It’s humid inside and smells like a mine, if you have asthma I don’t recommend it. At the end of the tunnel you can see the three barricades and go back.Before entry to the tunnel all personal effect must be locked away in lockers provided. We were given hardhats because parts of the tunnel were quite low and there were water dripping in quite a few areas. They advised that if you have high blood pressure etc, it might not be the best tour for you. A monorail is also available. It’s the steepest down and uphill walk I have done so far, and Korea is loaded with steeps steps and roads. They were die hards even walking with canes on this tour, they were encouraging me along the way. Staying in the back of the tour group will help if you are afraid of tunnels ( it might prevent panicking).Trust me, be ready to go down the tunnel, it was a bit tired. Then you walk further for about 5 minutes reaching the last point and see the other side, i guess that is north korean side. I cannot upload any photos because no camera allowed. It was quite cool down there and you can easily hit your head on the rock above your head. But dont worry, you have helmet.:)So hopefully you enjoy itThe Third Infiltration Tunnel is North Korean tunnel found below the DMZ. You have to wear a hard hat to go down into the tunnel. No photographs are allowed down the tunnel. A monorail is available to get you down to the tunnel. A great place for those interested in history and cold war politics.Incredible bit of history! One of many tunnels that the North Koreans attempted to build into the south for a possible invasion. But a defector gave the South Koreans the exact location and the South was able to intercept the tunnel before it was completed. It is a very long walk on a very steep incline. Bring some good walking/hiking shoes. Unless you are in very good shape, you will be tired by the end. There is also a very interesting museum right next to the tunnel.Before you enter there are lockers rooms to put all your things. No camera fons or bags are allowed.The tunnel is going downwards and takes total of 40 to 50mins to go down and back again.It is not advisable for old people or with frails legs, or weak feet due to coming up is a challenge.I didnt feel claustrophobic from the few 100 meters, but reaching the end of the tunnel is getting smaller but still ok for me.Inside the tunnel is airconditioned so compared to the hot temperature outside, it is great experience.There are designated smoking areas for smokers and shops for refreshment. We bought the whiskey as it is highly recommended.Really enjoyed the visit to the Third Tunnel as oart of my DMZ tour. It gives fascinating Insight into the nature of the conflict between the two Koreas.The North Built this massive tunnel with a view to invading the South. When it was discovered they passed it off as a coal mine! There is a steep descent into the tunnel built by the South Koreans to meet the tunnel. You walk for a couple of hundred metres until you sre only 170m. Away from the Northern limit of the DMZ.You need to be reasonably fit but it's not too bad, a lot of crouching and them a long ascent back to the surface. But if you're able bodied you'll be okay.No photos allowed inside the tunnel and they give you an mandatory hard hat- which believe me you'll need!Theres a good museum and a short 8ish minute film. A brilliant thing to visit.This is just a side dish of the DMZ tour.There are two ways to the tunnel. By monorail or walk 350 meter down(return is up). Before the event, you have to leave all your belongings including any portable phone and cameras (you have to walk thru a metal detector) and pick up your safety helmets. <U+00A0>The tunnel was quite low, also due to the metal reinforcement scaffolding the South had put in, so everyone over 5’4″ had to stoop. A tall man in front of us was having some trouble so at regular intervals you could hear the clang of hardhat against the metal pipes. You need to walk a several hundred meters to the three barricades and has really nothing significant to observe. Some of the tour members just skip this event.By the way, here is the northernmost point of tour spot before 2018 October when the Panmumjeom (5 km from 38° N) opened to Public."
헤이리 예술 마을,148건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경기도 파주 탄현면,7위(50곳의 파주 소재 관광지 중),"It seems quite a few of the galleries are empty these days -- at least compared to a trip I took with friends 2 years ago. Restaurants are plentiful and good. Those galleries and museums that are open offer an very eclectic array of art in various forms. If you are family with the southern California city of Laguna Beach -- it has a very similar feel. Worth the time.Good atmosphere, suitable for holidays. There are many coffee shops to choose from.you can come here alsoThe art village is about 45 minutes on the bus (number 2200) in Paju, northwest of Seoul. I went on a Tuesday and it's quiet, with few visitors. It was an overcast day (turned rainy in the afternoon), so everything was a bit grey. I had a leisurely stroll around. A number of buildings have nice modern architecture and designs, like a showcase of modern Korean architecture. There are art galleries, museums, artist studios, bookshops, cafes, restaurants, coffee/dessert/cooking/chocolate workshops, etc. On this visit, I checked out the Hangil Book House, the White Block Art Centre, a jewellery gallery, a music studio, and had coffee and cake at a cake studio. There are cafes everywhere, so it's quite handy. It is an interesting place to visit, a nice day out, in particular if you like architecture and design, coffee, and when the weather is good.Heyri Art Valley is is less than an hour northwest and was the vision of a book publisher many years ago. The inhabitants of Heyri Art Valley are mostly Korean artists such as writers, painters, actors, architects and musicians. Due to the artistic nature of the community, there are residences, workrooms, art galleries and museums, all of which are owned and operated by the artists themselves. In addition, there are also cafes and food courts for the convenience of visitors. We were there in the evening and most of the museums were about to close. So instead of taking the shuttle tour of the village, or visit a museum, we had wanted to just walk around and absorb the artsy vibes of the village.Unfortunately for us, the weather was pretty cold (and it was pretty dark), so we changed our minds and hopped back to the car to drive around to look for some nice cafe to chill. We finally settled on this book cafe which had shelves upon shelves of books. It was called Foresta Book Cafe. From the moment we entered, it was as if we were magically transported into a different world. The cafe has a bookstore and a museum within its premises. The cafe is on the first floor and has floor-to-ceiling shelves full of enormous collections of books, vast spaces with tables and chairs and aesthetics that book lovers would drool over.Definitely worth the visit the next time we are in Seoul (for really nice photos and atmosphere), there are still so many places we did not get to explore. For more on the experience and photos, please check out my blog. ^^Had a lovely morning here . Had a late breakfast at a bakery/cafe. Then a leisurely stroll around the shops, musuems and art galleries.Webt to the Time and Blade musuem, extensive collection of clocks, watches swords and knives from all around the world and different time frames. Had lunch at a quirky Korean restaurant where you shake your food in a hot tin to mix it up and blood sausage. Tasty! Book cafe well set out.Initially thought it’s an art village though they have some 3D and some art outside. Most of it are cafes here, where they have some parts of it to allow people to appreciate art in their cafe. But it’s quiet on a Friday. Good to spend time away from crowds if you like coffee and art.What more can I say. All 3 of our children said this was the best part of the entire trip to Korea. And we were here for 4 weeks.A very wet day brought about a change of plans & we ended up spending Sat. in this Art Village. It contains a hodgepotch of buildings (some odd looking ones) with different exhibits. In spite of the weather, there were lots of cars. These were probably people eating at the many food outlets rather than art enthusiasts. We visited exhibits with 3D art, musical instruments, jewellery, wood craft & pottery. In most of these places, we were the only people there. It should be even quieter on weekdays. As it’s about an hour’s drive north of Seoul, I would not put this place high on a tourist itinerary unless you like quirky architecture.There is nothing there except few cafe. Buildings are normal and not like web site described. It was freezing cold in Jan and I cannot see any interesting thing there.We went to this village from Ilsan on Tuesday afternoon, by taxi. It was about 20000 won taxi fare.The most interesting attraction to us, was the Museum of Modern History of Korea, located just at Gate 4. If you are middle age people, or even younger.. you would find this museum interesting.For us, it was like we went back to our childhood, with things and life styles in the past, around 1930(?) to the end of millennium. Brought back the memories, and eventhough we are from overseas, the lifestyle was approximately the same. Just like back to the past.The other attractions was quiet, not many visitors. It was like ""deserted""; may be it would be more people in week ends?.The public transportation was only bus, no taxi stands,"

Overall Adidas has the best bargain. Majority is local visitors so might face communication problem if you wish to get something from the food truck or stalls with local food.A medium-sized shopping area in Paju City, with many items to choose from. And have a beautiful corner to take picturesPart of our travel group itinerary going to the airport was spending time here to shop. Left with 2 hours time frame , I hate to admit, I was not that ready to do my shopping. No more space in my luggage to do last minute ones. Regretted not buying something from Adidas , Nike and Lacoste. Need to spend a half day at least here. Many restaurants and it would be convenient with the cooler weather cooperating.The only downside was the typical lining up at the airport for those tax refunds. Beautiful place to stroll around for a bit also.The journey from my hotel at Insadong to Paju premium outlet took about 1.5hr. There's nothing to wow about as the prices aren't cheap except for Adidas. Do note that take bus 2200 from exit 1 of Hapjeong station instead of exit 2 as stated on the website. The bus to Lotte premium outlet is much nearer than Paju,about 30 mins difference and the announcements for each station are all in Korean so pls do keep a lookout for the alighting point.I spent about 5 hours here due to the crowd at Adidas but it's all worry it! I bought a pair of kid's sandals just for 8000 won! Bought 4 pairs and 2 pairs of Adult's shoes cost me 140,000 won only! Other than Adidas and Nike, Other brands r not worth going.. I bought a Coach wallet in Sg for about $180 after a whopping 50 percent off but it's costs $350 after a 50 percent off! So it's actually much more expensive here! Having said that, I'm lucky that I came on a Sunday which is crowded with family and there's alot of events and freebies for the children. Like the vibe though but I will not visit in the near future... the prices in Japan's outlet is much better than here.Unless you have allot of money and trying to pay extra for luxury goods from previous collections avoid it. There are so many uber cool areas to shop in Seoul with local desginers. Follow the ""Made In Korea"" labels.

I’m happy with my shopping.Happy shopping everybodyWe happened to be there on one of the days which they had additional discounts on top of the pricing. Cons is that, it's out of Seoul. Would suggest a half day to full day there if you really into outlet shopping.not everything is cheaper than those in myeongdong. there a number worth the buy. pretty cold here. there was a sale going on. can try lotte premium outlet also as it’s along the bus route. took bus 2200 from hongik univ. exit 1 (go to your right and walk for a 100m). only an hour away. you can catch a view of north korea while enroute.Taken here from airport. There were a number of buses parked up..so the potential was there for business. Quite a big shopping complex, with individual shops, .. this is an OUTLET SHOP, for older and slower selling stock.. not for the latest!Lots of people... tourists and “locals”... most were seeming to be just browsing.)no/notCheap enough?)Nothing caught my eye, or was cheap enough to tempt me to buy..( cf with HK prices?)Saw a few shoppers with shopping bags....Rate... just a number of “ branded” shops... who’s prices were not as sharp as I thought they would be....in Korea!

We should have gone here first! This outlet is so much bigger, had more stores and better deals. They are divided in different blocks and buildings. Lotte Outlet is also nearer to Seoul. Good food choices compared to the food court in PPO. Got stuff from Lacoste, Adidas, Nike and Lohbs. Well worth the one hour trip from MyeongdongI love outlet shopping. It took us less than an hour to get there from our hotel in Myeongdong.Got some good deals at the Prada Outlet so it was all worth the ride there. They also had Ferragamo, Tod’s, Mulberry and Polo Ralph Lauren. I just stayed in Block A. Pretty sure there was much more in the other Blocks.You can also include the Paju Premium Outlet in the trip.There is so many brands here, price is good if compared to seoul. Parking was free during my visit, but still so little information that written in english. And it don't seems to be easy to reach with public transportation. But if you asked me, i would come here again on my next visit to korea.pretty big outlet, they have mostly all brands u need specially sporty brands, they have some kids playground on top of the building, so you should check out if you are with childrenNot a lot of variety like japan or hongkong and a bit pricier than those mentioned. It will require a 45mins bus ride but we went early so no traffic for us. Though price is higher than other asian outlet malls, we still scored quite a bit with the shoes ad jackets we got from asics, fred perry, nike, vans and guess. Imagine a fred perry leather slip-on that we got for only 50usd!I think it is the biggest lotte outlet all around the Korea. Or just i have been. I like their nike store. I highly recommend to go there. But mind your time. You need at least one day for big shopping. Brand's style is kinda old but it is a brand. Season off sale is bomb.I spent time took bus to here from the city, however it wasn't that good as I expected, the discount weren't that much, doesn't have a food courtWe have been this outlet twice and still find a lot of fun shopping there. Different from paju premium outlet, there`s a lot more local designer brands, more choices of different style clothing and accessories. The whole shopping area is huge, if you love shopping, u may need at least more than half-day to walk around, so stay overnight at nearby hotel is also a good idea.If you are expecting the usual outlets in U.S., you will be hugely disappointed. Good thing is, the place is big and quite nice but between myself and a friend, we left within an hour and empty handed."
신장 쇼핑몰,27건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경기도 평택,2위(11곳의 평택 소재 관광지 중),"I love to hate this place. I enjoy the shops and seeing all the clothing and Knick knack options, I hate that things are over priced and that you can hardly ask a question without the store owner thinking you’re going to buy something. The underground purse adventure is scary as sh!t but once you get out alive you kind hope it was all just drama for a tourist trap. The streets are smelly and dirty...typical for places like this, but they’re really trying to clean it up with new walkways and bringing new stores in. So if you can tolerate all the above then the food is totally worth the trip down here. You’ll find some unique places that make the shop haggles worth it. You won’t go hungry here. Also make sure to check out all the side streets, there are hidden gems to be found in ceramics, art, and furniture and it’s these places and the food that make the eating higher.I don't think there is much you can find here. Not much to see, little shopping and what there is you can find at each shop. You can find everything they sell here at the train station. A good walk if you have nothing better to do but I would not go out of my way to visit.On my first visit in 1992, this was still and active street and quite dangerous for a bar district. It's been ""cleaned-up"" since those days and now attracts families with their small kids. It is very quiet by night, but pretty rowdy on Friday and Saturday nights. choose your visiting time wisely; depending on what your looking for.It is outside of the main gate at Osan AB, lots of places to eat and shop. Be careful of the prices when shopping. Barter. You can also check the prices of many items that are also sold in the main train stations for cheaper. The vendors are used to people not knowing with the prices should be so be careful.Lot of stores around of all types! Jerseys, shoes, furnitures, souvenirs, you name it. Couple restaurants around as wellThe Shinjang shopping mall is mostly about shopping now. 20 years ago and before it was mostly a place to go to the bars and get just about the best time you could have if you had a little sense. Don't go there at night looking for so much fun anymore. It's all cleaned up and shined up and toned down in fun.A great place to spend a lazy Saturday or Sunday Afternoon. Lots of touristy shops, restaurants, and bars. Hurry before this becomes Itawon South. New construction seems to pop up every day.Itaewon is overplayed and got too expensive. This area still retains its old school charm. Hurry before all the construction makes this Itaewon South.There is always a new place to eat or many places to go get drinks with friends. There are plenty of choices of restaurants from around the world. Mostly Thai and Turkish. But a little bit of everything. If you want a place to have a drink, all types of bars from kinda classy to borderline seedy. But it is well monitored.Directly outside the main gate of Osan Air Base, this shopping street offers food of all types from around the world; shops such as handbags, blankets, tailors; and countless bars."

We spent about 4 hours wandering this area and enjoying various things.So we went late, but I think that is probably for the best. It was winter and not a lot happening. It seems to be a place full of cute photo opportunities. There is a really nice indoor garden, and a craft area where you can make your own soap, candles, bath bombs, shampoo etc. I would like to go back and do this, it takes time though, so be prepared to spend a few hours. Night time is beautiful as it is lit up like a Christmas tree. Worth going late just for this.We were here on a cold weather. About -7 degrees centrigade and it was night time. The park is lit with colorful lights. It was amazing. The garlic bread is really tasty.I personally enjoy this place. Can take bus outside the Soyosan Station on ur right.

Best time to go is afternoon until late noon when the lights is up at 5pm.Can reach by public transportation from Jamsil station. But the bus frequency is not so good.

Another attraction is healing centre where you will find all the organic cosmetics. The entry fee is only 6000won per adult.Went to the herb Island as a group tour, spent about 3 hours there, had lunch at the traditional market but they only served mutton soup with rice and kimchi pancake. The cafe only served pizza. The restaurant pricing about usd10+. There were many shops that sells candles. Went to the santa village, a bit weird when it is Sept now, but I feel that should pay a visit using the Christmas season, and evening will be better when the lights light up. In the Santa village, u will see Christmas decorations, dinosaurs and right end of the santa village, you can see other small animals like rabbit, hens, piglets, you can also feed Donkey at 1000 won."

Price was reasonable and we opted to buy the round trip monorail tickets. Plan for babywearing rather than a stroller if you want to go up some of the places with only stairs. Some stairs are steep and spiral but it's okay if you're prepared. We spent about 2 hours there. Parking on site is available but can be tight. We travelled with a 5 and 3 year old and they enjoyed walking around and seeing everything.Public transportation is lacking to go there. The direct buses run every two hours. Please check the website for exact scheduling from the Pocheon bus terminal. You can take other buses that run more frequently and walk the road to art valley but the walking can take longer. The main sights of Pocheon art valley is very beautiful!!! However, it is small and if you come by yourself then it will feel like a waste of time. If you come with friends or your loved ones then it will be more worthy. I didn’t take the monorail to the top, I just walked. It is a steep hill but not super long.

We definitely enjoyed our visit.This is the best place in pocheon. There are couple of places in pocheon, you don’t have lots of options. But this must be your first locationWe started our visit with a look through the retro game display. It was nostalgic and fun. Then we caught the monorail to the top of the park. There is stuff to see everywhere. You can walk to the top, there are statues a long the way and places to sit. The park is well set out with a few different areas. Of course there is the beautiful quarry. Even in winter is was truly beautiful with frozen waterfalls and ice all around. It has wheelchair access but some of the ramps are steep, so be careful. Oh and there is also a rather large reclining statue of a naked man, with his legs apart???In this art valley, they have a creation and experience center, an exhibition hall for stone culture, a monorail, an astronomical science museum, an outdoor concert hall, the Cheonjuho lake, a sculpture park, a media facade, a doleum stairs, the Hosur Concert hall and the Jeonmang Cafe. It is a very good day out for both young and old to explore our world.The quarry turned tourist attraction is an amazing place for photography. It is Northeast of Seoul so we decided to book a day tour to cover this and Herb Island. Arriving at almost sunset was a superb idea because we were able to capture good shots of the quarry and when the sun set, special lighting shone on the area and the quarry looked mystical as the lighting changed.It was a quarrying site turned into a museum. A lot of beautiful site to take pictures but not a much else to do. There are modern art display all over the place.Has photographic zone where few dramas/movies was suited. Mono rail helps to take up to top within 10 minutes, while returning you can return by walk to take pictures.Went via a tour, journey from Seoul to pocheon about 1 hour. The place was beautiful, neat but small. Went there to see as the Korean Odyssey and The legend of the blue sea were filmed there.Might not be suitable for elderly as the steps can be steep."

During the winter period when we visited this place, there were hardly any visitors around. All the F&B stalls within the theme park were closed, except for a couple of restaurants outside the main entrance (the right hand side one was a much better option!) and an excellent cafe on the 1st floor away from the main entrance. There are about 8-10 different sites to explore within the theme park, and kids would be happy to run around collecting different passport stamps whenever they arrive at a new site, The most attractive site for me was the gated palace area, where a few mini museums are housed. There is a small amusement/adventure park for kids, and visitors are required to pay a separate entrance fee for that. Daylight was rather short during the winter months, the whole place started to turn dark at around 5pm. To make full use of the time there, it is therefore more meaningful to visit the theme park in late spring or summer time.Gimhae Gaya Theme Park And Gimhae National MuseumI visited this place on the 4. April 2017It is very easy to reach: on the Light Rail System from Sasang ( Metro Line 2) past the Gimhae International Airport to Gimhae National Museum (Station 518) .It can also be reached by Metro (Line 3) DaejeoTo spend a whole day is just great. Nice walking trails around the Royal Tomb of King Suro. A lot of information is well presented. The personnel at the information centre is friendly and helpfull.The Guidebook for "" Gimhae, Land of the Gaya"" is free and gives a lot of information for hole Gimhae, a Happy City with Beautiful Nature!Inside the museum there are excellent exhibits, presented in modern design.This themed park was open on May 2015.

We had dinner at one of the restaurants (only discovering later that there were more choices, but we were happy where we were) and then strolled through the town and down to the water. Surprises and delights at every turn!A wide and green place near the sea with a nice landscape. It is famous for terraced rice paddies on a steep hill on the outskirts. You can experience farming and making maquettes of the farmer with paper there.Namhae in my opinion is really a good place to unwind, destress & take a refreshing walk cuz of the interesting agricultural scenery as well as the stunning seashore especially in Daraengi Village. We went there with a group & tried some activities. As i walk down beside the rice paddies terraces..the road was steep but so safe & there were restaurants & many guesthouses in the area. The village also has a perfect view of the sea.If you want to escape from the crowded city, just come to this village. you will feel a peaceful here. The combination of mountain, sea, and farming here will make you forget the problems in city.I wonder about the famous Korean villages? Here's one of them! The village is near the town of Namhae, called Daraengi. And it is famous for its rice fields, many people know that rice here in Korea is eaten like bread? So rice is grown here for almost all of Korea. And what is very interesting, in the spring there is a festival of flowering rice Daraengi Rice Paddy! The festival offers many interesting programs that allow visitors to experience traditional Korean agriculture and explore the cultural and natural heritage of Darenga Village such as: field furrowing, Korean wrestling, rice planting, running with rice cushions and much more. And also we tried to build a cow and shepherd from paper, who work in the field. I think for children it will be very exciting.It is a small place with an amazing beach view. We had a doll making experience. It was one of kind to have. This place is good for couples, family, even for kids to have a fun activity. The greenery around village was a treat to eyesA small but extremely beautiful village. The village consists of colorful roofs and terraced fields. The overall look of the village is superb. Must walk down to the village and discover the combination of beautiful sea and cliff. It is a perfect place for photography.We visited this place on a very very very rainy day so we could not do outdoors farming activities and stayed inside to make dolls, very cute. The vibe was perfect, everywhere was green, the air clean, you can see the sea faraway, the host were super helpful even though he does not speak English. Cannot miss this place when you visit Namhae. Very good. Very fun. Much fun. Namhae is very fun. 90% of visitors are foreigners, so no worries.The village is in a lovely location. If i am honest the village wasn't too special, though it did offer great views, and just a chance to see something different. But i would recommend coming here just for the coastal drive that you'll do to get there. We saw absolutely stunning views during the drive, and for that alone it is worth it. Then the decision to stop or not in the village is yours... Great views.I went this place through Adventure Korea. Daraengi Village was part of the tour and it was a just ordinary place you can see in South Korea. The difference is it is kind of stair rice paddy field, which was nothing special. The tour included sea fishing and sea kayaking. The sea fishing was expensive. The sea kayaking was awful because we saw some fish while we were doing kayaking. The organiser should have known this and should have taken us to elsewhere instead. It was disgusting to see so many dead fish. The guest house was in terrible condition with bad smell in room. Overall, Adventure Korea's organisation skills are inferior and the tour was terrible.Namhae ocean itself was beautiful though."

The food was good but somewhat expensive.Staying in a guesthouse here was really comfortable and felt like home. The village houses a museum where we learnt a bit about the sacrifices of the Koreans who moved to Germany to work in order to build up their country. Beautiful place with beautiful people!The history about this place wonders me and being there was so relaxing . Trying German food here in korea was also interesting. The island is so beautiful that I want to just live there for the rest of my life.There has a different feeling from other places in Korea as all the buildings are built like German houses. We didn't have enough time to surf it during the day and also it was rainy so I think we couldn't see the beauty of that place as it was. I would like to be there one more time on a sunny day. But I don't recommend this place to stay and sleep at night. Especially in summer, there are various kinds of insects in the rooms that don't let you sleep peacefully.It's a very cute little neighborhood with beautiful scenery, German style houses with red roofed ,white walls and little yards. It is a great weekend getaway with family and friends!Like this place because the atmosphere here is just like in German. Even the people there also can speak english. I remember the owner of villa that I stayed, she is really kind and nice.More than the beautiful and accommodating village, the history and story of the village touched my heart. Knowing all the beautiful details of the past which linked Korea and Germany in the Museum inside the village was thrilling. I would love to visit there again soon.I visited here on late July. As I arrived I faced with breathtaking scenery, pretty quite area, birds singing along in a beautiful foggy day. In south Korea where you are surrounded by tall apartments, being in a peaceful place such as German village is pleasant. House style in the village is unique there are also guest house there. the photo that I attached is sweet view of our balcony. Don't know how pleasing was walking up to this awesome view. Btw I should mention that equipment in the room that we were was not modern or high-tech; it was as simple as a house in beautiful village~~ Room very clean, big and cozy.German village is special place for Koreans. I recommend to visit this place for nature lovers, there are amazing view and a lot of beautiful houses in the German style. as well as many large and wide cafes. my friends and I settled in cozy cottages. spent a good time in a quiet and calm atmosphere and learned a lot about the historycal relations of Korea and Germany.The German village consists of authentic german architecture houses made with german materials imported from Germany. The initial purpose of the German village was to help korean miners and nurses who worked in the 1960s at Germany to adjust and relocate back in Korea. Now, the village has transformed into a tourist spot and provides all visitors an authentic german experience, check out german pubs selling draft beer as well as restaurants serving german food such as bockwurst."

This and two temples were all in close proximity and very beautiful. Plus an old wall. If you're in Miryang, worth seeing. Bring good shoes for walking/hiking and be ready for beautiful views if you walk to the top. If you like historical sites, this one is great. Highly recommend.If you have harf day plan of Milyang you should come to here. Milyang have some of famous confusianism recture hall(auditorium)and Pyochung-sa(budish temple)but im not recommend coming unless you are location resident. Busan or Kyeongju are much better than here.It is only 10 min walk from bus terminal and is situated at the center of downtown. It was amazing to see the legend of Yongnamru here at Milyang. It was a good place to walk and to rest. The view is amazing from the inside of the building. I heard they filmed a drama here as well. I think it is an amazing tour spot of Milyang.When I visited Miyang Yongnamru I didn't know this place was a background of famous Korean legend. But I remember watching the Korean drama, "" Arang and the Magistrate"" starring Sin Min Ha. Well the story is about a daughter of magistrate who has been wrongfully murdered by her stepmother. She comes back as a ghost and ask the newly appointed magistrates to tell about her death and asks for help. There is a shrine in Yongnamru where people come to pray for her. You can see beautiful scenary around the temple as well as learn about the Arang legend."

I hit up that water park. After 3pm the price a bit cheaper so peep that. Here is the number one tip I gots for yall...you has got to bring your hat. Apparently this common sense that you must be rocking a hat at the water park in Korea. If you don’t have a hat you can’t do anything at this place. Some people rock the swim cap but most just got a baseball cap on they lid. So if you thinking about hitting this place up, bring yo hat. Also, everyone needs a life jacket for the wave pool and lazy river, so you probably be renting on unless you rock a life jacket regularly. But you can’t wear the life jacket in the baby pool. I took the life jacket off to go in there and then some lady stealed it. This place pretty good for the kids but you ain’t catch me going on them big slides. It is also kind of far from anything but if you in the area check it out it worth a chill if you kickin it in Yangsan.The hardest attraction to reach if you want to go here from Busan.The park is located near the Yangsan station, which is at the other end of Jangsan station in Busan.Then, you still need to ride a bus, and walk a little bit uphill to reach it.The rides are designed for children and teens, and the visitors are usually families or a group of friends, but the place is deserted.It's clean and well-kept, but it receives very few visitors.On a positive side, you can take a photo where you're the only one around."
통도사,80건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경상남도 양산 하북면 통도사로 108 (우) 50501,1위(17곳의 양산 소재 관광지 중),"We have been to Tongdosa temple today. It was quite an adventure to get there (metro to Busan bus terminal), 20 minutes in a nice bus and 1,5km beautiful walk. It was all worth it! We have tried in advance to arrange a temple stay. Unfortunately my mails to the website are still unanswered. On Tripadvisor the latest Review was outdated, so I thought that something was wrong with this site. Now we have seen it, it feels bad that the temple stay could not been arranged. Happy we did the half day trip! Good to combine with Beomeo-sa temple.I'm an English teacher nearby, as an assignment I had my students write on, ""a beautiful place in Yangsan"", all except one stuent chose Tongdosa. One of the students titled their paper something like, ""the four colors of Tongdosa"" explaining why Tongdosa is beautiful in all four season. It's an absolute jewel. Every time I visit I feel peaceful and relaxed. There are enough tourists, that you don't feel like your intruding in a sanctuary, but it doesn't feel crowded. There is English signage everywhere explaining the stories and meanings of different shrines. It was originally established during Korea's first regnant queen, Seondeok of Silla. One of the hermitages is dedicated to housing artifacts of the Buddha, including a bone of the Buddha, brought from Tang China by the Temple's founder Jajangyulsa.It is not only a historic place, but a living place. Once when I went, a local artist had installed multiple statues of ""The Little Prince"", with signage saying that the Little Prince reminds us of our childhood, and we can try to look at Tongdosa through the eyes of the little prince.There is a great museum, a spacious picnic area, and hiking trails above.If you're in Busan it's a bit of a nuisance to get there, but it's an absolute treasure.Even in the pouring rain, the temple and the landscape made an impression. A rather simpler temple than the ones we had seen in Japan, it conveyed a sense of peace and calm, nevertheless. Surrounded by bamboo and pine tree forests, the temple and the scenery represent the beauty of Korea, as put by our Korean friend. We were lucky enough to be taken there by our friend, as the temple is some way out of Busan.Tongdosa is beautiful. It is a way out of Busan, but well worth the visit. There are no statues of Buddha, but there is a special picture. The Temple houses relics and is a major Buddhist place of worship.Tongdosa is one of the 3 major Temples in Korea Because the Real Shrines of BUDDHA are Preserved there.Tongdosa can be reached by a 30 mins bus ride (from the Nopo metro / train station at the northern outskirt of Busan) plus 30 mins very pleasant stroll from the bus stop. It isn't mentioned by most tourist information brochures / sheets / maps although it is one of the 3 jewels of temple in Korea. It represents the Buddha because it houses the Buddha's sariras. The other two are Haeinsa near Daegu that represents the dharma because it houses the 80,000 wooden blocks of Tripitaka Koreana; and Songgwangsa near Gwangju that represents the Sanga because it's trained many famous monks. We are lucky to be able to see all 3 of them. Tongdosa is my second favourite after Haeinsa.After getting off from the bus station, it's less than 10 mins walk to reach the entrance gate (where we need to pay a small entrance fee like most other temples). Beyond the gate is a long walkway called ""dancing wind & cold pines"" path by a river, surrounded by many tall pine trees and decorated with stoned lamp posts. We reached the temple ground after a wonderful 20 mins stroll. Many timber buildings inside the temple ground are quite raw in design but offer a very harmonious and peaceful feeling. The small museum houses many buddha paintings which is gem. Behind the hall at the back of the temple ground is where the Buddha's sariras preserved. It is a restricted area but if people are interested they can have a glimpse through. We really enjoy the natural, unpretentious, harmonious and peaceful atmosphere of Tondosa.More than 1,000 years old, the temple contains the history of Buddhism. Plenty of monks, buildings, statutes, springs and scent of nature you can enjoy. Interested? I recommend it is the place you should visit if you want to know Korea. The location, close to Busan, the 2nd city in Korea.It's a really big and interesting temple complex, but the most interesting is that you can get into the park with your car and you can drive through the whole park, from one temple to the other. The nature inside the park is, at least, as beautiful as the temple buildings!To get here you can walk, drive, taxi or take a bus (then a 20 minuite walk approx).The temple is set in some fantastic landscape with forest, rivers and paths. Really is a tranquil place. I am not religious but even I admit I was impressed with this place. What gets me is that entrance is free, something other nations should offer. Facility are very good, food, drinks and shops. great place to spend the day and maybe take a packed lunch. Pleased I was able to see this.Absolutely stunning.Hiking up the Yeongnam Alps to visit the largest zen Buddhist monastic complex in South Korea and the Buddha relics are preserved in several of the stupas. Reminded me of Ragjir/Vultures peak which I visited on my pilgrimage in India last year!!!We also wandered deep into the mountain forest following the foot tracks to the top and a couple of very friendly Korean monks invited us in for tea. Don't leave Busan without seeing this!"

If you go to the museum, slip into the temple.It's a pretty small museum, maybe only 6 galleries, mostly large ancient paintings.There I SAW THE OLDEST PRINTED BOOK I'D EVER SEEN!!!!! It was pre-guttenberg, from the early 1400s, I got so excited. Sorry about the nerd moment.Also, the interior decorations are nice. English signage is good. There are permanent displays and temporary exhibitions. You need to pay to get into the temple, but you don't need to pay more to see the museum. The monks charged with the museum were really friendly."
진주성,123건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경상남도 진주 본성동 Bonseong-dong (우) 52692,1위(40곳의 진주 소재 관광지 중),"This fortress is much more than some dusty pile of old masonry. It contains beautiful buildings, houses and a major museum. While we were there it was particularly interesting as colourful (historic) life sized manikins were everywhere, either attacking or defending the castle, or displaying aspects of life in historical times. The display overall is very impressive although a couple of bits were a bit to ""Disney"" for my liking. Like most attractions of this type in Korea the entry fee was very low. The castle walls and structures are in very good condition, parts overlook a large river. If you are in Busan I would recommend you set aside part of a day to visit Jinju and its castle. The bus from Busan drops you off a short distance from the castle, it's really worth a visit.We had a great time with our friends- a large group of 11 of us ages 1-40+. I would just caution to watch young children as there are rocks without railings.This fortress has a key position on the river & easy access to the city. The site is surrounded by the fortress a walls & has various gate entrances/exits. The interior has a lovely garden feel with grassed areas & trees. There are numerous building's /temples structures to look at & access. The view from the wall across the river is great, especially when the lantern Festival is on.Within the grounds is the Jinju National museum - also worth a visit.It costs around 2$ to see. Stone ramparts run maybe 2km. Pavilions, Shrines, statues, altars, monuments, gates, a temple and a free national museum emerge from the forest/garden as you wander cobble stone paths.The place is maintained to remember the Imjin wars, in particular the 2 battles of Jinju, where the Fortress first repelled and then succumbed to the Japanese invaders.Heroes are remembered, patriots are honored, sacrifice is respected.Living in Korea I get a little tired of all of the historic sites dedicated to remembering how horrible the Japanese were, and how amazing and patriotic the koreans were. I get it, message received, maintaining national narrative and national identity preserved. Now can I learn about what daily life was like? How many people lived here? What did they eat? Where did their food come from? What was the relationship between the local people and the feudal overlords like? What did you need to do to be the boss of this fort? Was it a hereditary title, or were military officials appointed from the capital? Did the generals live in the fort? Where did their families live? What kinds of people worked here, and what were their jobs? Who were some significant korean historical figures who passed through here, did they say anything about the place?What objects were part of the average person's life? What were their houses like? How did humans live here?I have so many questions.... ahh... and yes, I'm lazy, and greedy...I want them answered on nice big boards in at least six languages.Yes, that is a complaint. But I really like the place, in fact I've gone twice, in Fall and in Spring.The museum and fortress are worth a visit. There are lots of places to sit and read a good book under a shady tree. The view of the river is lovely. I wish I could learn more about the daily lives of past people. But the purpose of the historical site is to remember the violence of the Imjin wars and to honour patriotic korean heroes.Got to learn a great deal and accuracy on the war that was fought involving Joseon, China and Japan. The museum is new and i really enjoyed how it is curated. Simple, interactive and detailed. The artifacts were awesome especially to learn on the prowess of weaponry back in the days.Entry fee is 2000KRW.To get here from Seoul is rather time consuming. I took the Express Bus from Seoul Express Bus Terminal. It took 4 hours. Alight at the Jinju terminal. Bus will stop outside a university before the terminal.Then you have 3 choices.Walk.Turn left outside terminal.Walk and cross to the right. Walk on the left for about 15 to 20 minutes.Once you walk across a river, lookout for Jinjuseong sign. It will point to the left.Taxi.Just flag one outside the terminal.BusGo left outside terminal.Cross to the right.Walk by the left.Take Bus 130 from nearby bus stop.Alight at the 4th stop.Lookout for Jinjuseong signboard which will point to the left.While there’s not much to see in Jinju, this is definitely worth a visit. Simply strolling around is quite refreshing and gives you a good overview on the city and river below.Our tour group stopped at this site during our trip from Seoul to Busan. Although this place is called a fortress but it was more like a park with several monuments to the battles with the Japanese in 1592 and 1593.Do pick up the pamphlet about Jinjuseong Fortress at the ticket office which provides pictures and descriptions of the main features of this site. Signs at the site are in both Korean and English. Expect to do plenty of walking in the sun so a hat and sunglasses are recommended along with sunscreen.CY ( 18.05.15 ) This castle had important meaning when Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592. The castle was located beside river, and had historic event. The inside was good to walk with good river view, and had museum.Former castle/military installation which has now been converted to a memorial of sorts with nice leafy grass areas within it's walls.There are a few shrines and memorial installations on the premises and it's a good place to go for a stroll if you have any interest in Korean military history.The car park is quite small and finding a parking space is a bit difficult particularly on the weekends, so best to visit early.This a compact fortress with many small but very interesting buildings. The statue of General Kin Si-min is quite impressive and he is obviously held in very high regard within this area, if not through the Korea....The story attached to the Uiam Rock is quite bought provoking. I'm sure you will read all about it however a lady ""Nongae"" threw herself from this famous rock killing a Japanese General and herself at he same time. Quite a sacrifice for revenge.....The memorial alter is also very special in that it commemorates the lives lost in three great historic battles.... 70,000 including civilians on one occasion...... TD a modern alter built in 1987.In summary a very interesting place to visit but important to read or have a guide to explain all the history for full impact. Certainly worth a visit."
부곡 하와이,15건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경상남도 창녕 부곡면 온천중앙로 77,1위(9곳의 창녕 소재 스파 / 웰니스 중),"HI,Its almost end of April 2016 when we had a visit to Bugok, the so called hot spring.Me together with 3 of my friends from India expected a lot before visiting the place. All are Indoor spas and not worth to spent money and time, more over its not clear about the type of spas. At last we wasted a complete day too. I strongly recommend to check more about the location before making the visit.Bugok Hawaii is pretty a famous attraction in Changnyeong. Many come to visit here for the outdoor and indoor pool attractions next to the hotel. The hotel is an ordinary hotel but the attractions nearby are the reason why people chose to stay here. Enjoy the water park in the morning and the famous hot spring at night. In summer there are light festivals and in winter there are ice statue exhibition as well.We have been to Bugok Hawaii many times. It’s actually the closest water park with natural hot spring from our place plus we really love the drive going there.As compared to other waterpark in the South, it can be considered old and not as nice as the new ones; however, I think one of the best features of this resort is really the natural hot springs. We go there with friends so we use the outdoor springs where girls and boys are allowed to be together. We come to Bugok mostly during winter to escape the cold weather. Taking a dip and staring at the sky is so relaxing. Plus, only few people are there because it is off peak season.Usually after swimming, before going home (we never tried to stay in the hotel), we would play at the theme park outside the waterpark, but since it is off-peak season, the rides are usually not open.Sometimes in winter, they put a manmade snow hill so guest can sled down the hill. The way going up to this hill is also fascinating. Good view of the waterpark plus some old posts and stones on the side of the hill in different forms or representations.Another best moment I had here was last spring, when all people are in Jinhae for the cherry blossom festival, we are here. The hill is also full of cherry blossoms. When the wind blew, the cherry blossoms fell as if it was snowing. We took so many pictures and videos because it is simply pretty and amazing. Moreover, not too many people around that will ruin our background and cherry blossom experience. Looking forward to experiencing it again this coming spring.a special place that you have everything in it, pools, spa, private naked place, kids land, restaurants, you need to bring with you your swimming wear or you could buy from there and you must wear head swimming cap, if you dont have you could buy from there.Great Waterpark!! This was one of the best trips I have made in Korea! The park has a lot of things to do, slides, wave pool, diving, indoor pools, outdoor pools, a HUGE spa..... This is a must see/must do venue in Korea. Take the family and have a blast. If you are American or used to American waterparks, please remebr in Korea you need a HAT when you are in the water. Not completely sure why, but bring one or you will buy one there :)This is a warning to whom it may concern about working for/at or visiting Bugok Hawaii-Korea. The president of there , Kenji Kanazawa from Japan completely abuses his authority and position to have young foreign women engage in sexual affairs with him.  I had a contract to work at Bukok Hawaii for the duration of six months starting from April 30, 2012. Shorty after starting work there, Kenji Kanazawa approached me one day while I was on break and asked my name. Knowing that he was the "" Big Boss "", I replied and so it all started. From that day forth he persisted to come by and watch my shows since I am a dancer and continued to chat with me sometimes bringing me coffee and chocolates. I started to feel the burden of having to accommodate him but since employees from Eastern European countries are frequently abused there, I felt that I had no choice but to continue speaking to him. One day after about a month he demanded my phone number so that he would be able to contact me for personal matters. Again, since he is the president of Bugok Hawaii, I gave it to him. So it all started. Shortly after acquiring my phone number he started to text message me on a daily basis several times a day. Then soon after he stated that he would like to have dinner with me to discuss work and other matters. He took me the city of Busan to have coffee at the Paradise hotel. He told me that we should be friends and I fell for his bait. We discussed different topics. He about his wife and children in Japan and I about my work, family, boyfriend, and my country. Shortly after that night he returned to Japan to see his family. Upon returning to Korea, he contacted me immediately again. He asked me to come out to have dinner with him then took me to a sushi restaurant in the city of Changwon. This continued for the duration of a month. Taking me to dinner or coffee in the city of Busan, Changwon, and Daegu. I trusted him as a friend and advisor about work and life in general since all our conversation topics were those discussed by true friends. He even frequently asked about my boyfriend whom was in Seoul.  Then came the day of October 1, 2012. It was Chuseok a national Korean holiday. I had originally planned to go to Seoul to visit my boyfriend since I had 2 days off. But at the last moment management suddenly imformed me that my days off had been canceled and that I wouldn't be able to go to Seoul. Whether or not Kenji Kanazawa had intentionally planned this is in question since we foreign workers have no right to voice our opinions while working there. He knew my schedule and so asked me to have dinner with him again in Busan since I would not be going to Seoul. After having dinner in Busan, he suddenly stated that there is too much holiday traffic for us to drive back to Bugok and that he was very tired and felt that he could not drive and insisted that we stay at the Paradise hotel for the night and leave early next morning. I immediately knew his intentions and asked him if the hotel would have enough rooms since it was a holiday and hotels lack accomodation during this period. I insisted in having separate rooms but he stated that there is only one available and that we could just talk and eat some food. Once in the room his attitude completely changed. He ordered flowers and some food then changed the topic to his personal life apart from his family. He continued to say that he loves to take out beautiful women and have intimate relationships with young girls. He then told me that since he is the president of the company of Bugok that he can get his way with anything that he wants. After an hour or so of talking he forced himself upon me and had his way sexually. The morning he took me home and reminded me before letting me get out of his car that the company is holding on to my passport as well as all the other girls from Eastern Europe that were working there. So from that day forth during the period of the month of October he called me out over 7 times to have sex with him taking me to again to the Paradise Hotel and another hotel in Busan called the Choseon Hotel. Four of the times he took me to a hotel near city hall in the city of Changwon. To make my shame feel even worse, he asked me to be his mistress even after my contract was over and to come back to Korea to study. He stated that he would pay for my tuition, rent me an apartment, and support all my other financial needs. I refused telling him that I have a boyfriend and that what he was doing was wrong. He insisted that sex is sex and he is also married with children and that he had many relationships with mistresses in the past.  A couple of days before my departure from Bugok he gave me a phone stating that he had rented it so that he could contact me. Upon arriving back to my home in Ukraine, he sent me a few emails saying that there was nothing between us and that he forgot everything that happened and for me to return the phone.  Mr Kenji Kanazawa, you have shamed me, your family, and who knows how many other unsuspecting young girls that you hire to work for you. Even in terms of basic human rights for your employees do not exist since you use your threats of holding on to our passports and being able manipulate the Korean immigration to your advantage and do us harm. You try to sweet talk then when that doesn't work to your advantage you use your position of authority to manipulate people to your bidding. If we were women from a better developed country you could not have done any of this to me without the law interfering. And I'm sure that you're aware of several other girls being told that they are hired as stage performers then once they are there they are forced to work as hostesses or prostitutes at your other Korean employees bars and clubs. Just because we are from a lesser developed country than yours does not permit you to use us as objects for sex. You being a husband and a father to two young girls should know all women from any country also have their morals and values. Then again, your disregard to mine only displays your apathy towards foreign workers rights. I am posting this to warn others of making a decision to work at Bugok Hawaii Korea. Everything seems appropriate and relevant until you actually are there. Then things change for the worse and your rights are stripped from you and you are treated as a hostage and slave. Please think twice and reconsider before accepting employment there. There are many other places to work as actual performers such as Everland Korea, LottleWorld Korea, or SeoulLand Korea all of which I had the opportunity to work in much better conditions without the inhumane attitude towards foreign workers.This place is a not as advertised on the Internet. Our bath tub and sink are missing enamel and the shower as a whole looks like a crime scene. I can imagine that in summer time this place would be pumping but as it's winter now the whole place looks like a b grade horror movie set in a theme park. It's old and very worn down. Don't take your wife if you want to stay married to her!"

I'm not sure if there was an entrance fee as we just walked, the attendant did not stop us as we walked on in passed the temporary exhibition room and up the stairs to the permanent exhibition. On this second floor a breif history of Changwon is covered from Prehistoric times, then to the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592, traditional village life in Masan with some great displays on fishing techniques, to the Masan revolution on the 15th of March 1960 and lastly the development of free trade zone in the region. It took us a little under thirty minutes to explore the mueum, there were sufficient English explanations for us to understand the displays, when there was no English translations the good quality artifacts told their own story. The musuem used multi-media throughout: short films, photographs, visual and written displays. At the far end of the second floor exhibits was a children's activity space. This was an enjoyable and enlightening small musuem.From Incheon we went to Masan and spend our entire trip there. The city was small and calm. The people were so helpful, friendly and polite.Changwon City Museum is nice. There was a good temporary exhibit of Turkish art when we visited, which was interesting. It was good to see such a small, regional museum attempting to offer international perspectives on art. The sculpture garden outside the museum is the real draw to visiting, but the museum itself is well worth an hour of your time if you're in the area.It's a small museum that gives a bit of local culture. It's free! I enjoy it as a current resident of the city and it's nice to learn something!"
여좌천,122건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경상남도 창원 여좌동 (우) 645-250,1위(57곳의 창원 소재 관광지 중),"This a very photogenic area. There are beautiful statues and/or light structures in the riverbed that look nice in the day and would probably look amazing at night. Definitely bring a good camera, as there's many great photo opportunities. Going during the cherry blossom festival is quite nice, but be prepared for crowds. Many of the trees are intentionally situated to create specific spots for pictures, but it's still beautiful with full blooms out. Highly recommend going, but be patient.Pictures on most reviews seem to let you see alot more cherry blossoms but in reality by walking along the bridges you can only see hanging cherry blossoms dangling along the stream. Too far for nice pictures. If you cannot wait for the lights to be up after 7pm then there is no need to spend alot of times walking through all the 3 bridges despite the different statues under the bridge as they dun look different.Super romantic when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. I went third week of March and there were a few blooms seen. I guess it will be full in April.Nice to walk along or at the bottom.Just be careful as there are lots of small bees collecting nectar from the flowers. I am not sure how it will be when the whole stretch is blooming with flowers. How many bees will be buzzing about.Directions:. Jinhae Bus Terminal. Blue bus 160. You can take 150, 162 or Green bus 307, 309, 31. I used Blue 160. Alight at the 8th stop.. Walk to the traffic junction. Cross the road to the left. Walk straightThe stream is right ahead.I am going to south Korea september 2018 and I will visit Jinhae. Is it beautiful that time? and can I see cherry blossom?Must go personally in order to have first hand experience of seeing and feeling the cherry blossom in full bloom.Cherry blossom was awesome. This place felt very festive with food stands and cherry blossoms along a stream.I heard that the Jinhae Cherry Blossom Festival is one of the best, so I booked a tour with Trazy. We took the KTX train from Seoul Station to Daegu and then took a bus to Changwon. Once we got to Changwon, we used a combination of taxi, rental car, local bus, and walking to get us to various sites.Yeojwacheon Stream is a beautiful little stream and walkway that is lined on both sides with beautiful cherry blossoms. It is a sight to behold when it’s in its full glory and loaded with blossoms. Unfortunately, it is a very popular destination, so be prepared to share the stream with throngs of people all trying to take selfies and get that special photo. Because of the crowds, it is better to visit during the week and very early in the morning, if possible. Having said that, I never found the crowds to be rude or unpleasant in any way. Everyone is there to enjoy the spectacular flowers and the warmer weather.The blooms only last a few days, so keep close tabs on the blossoms forecast to avoid disappointment. Also, there are beautiful cherry blossoms on Anmin road driving up the hill or mountain. There is a walking path if you can find a place to park your car (that’s why we had a rental car for part if the day). The cherry blossoms that line the road are gorgeous, and there are no crowds, at least none when we were there on a Wednesday. It is a great thing to do after visiting the Stream for a different perspective.We arrived Yeojwacheon stream at 2nd of April, start with a sunny day, what we have seen was flowers every where!!! although there are all fill up with people, but at the phone zone, people will automatically queue up. At night some of the location will have light show. Highly recommended visit there both day and night.It was beautiful even when the trees were not in bloom. There is a nice wooden path lined on either side by cherry trees all the way.The whole stream was covered by Cherry Blossoms and they even decorated it with artworks, there was a lit of food stalls on the street next to the stream, I would suggest to come here in the morning during the festival to avoid the crowded scene. Definitely one of the most magical experience I've ever had. :)"

This undersea tunnel was built by the Japanese when they colonized Korea, in order to gain better accessibility in transportation, and also shows how advanced Japanese engineering at that time was. Inside the tunnel, there are notices of important people who played a part in Tongyeong's history, namely Dongpirang Village and how they played a part in preventing the village from being demolished to make way for redevelopment, as well as poets and artists who lived in Tongyeong or who contributed to the arts scene. Also you will see the different islands that are a boat/ferry ride away from Tongyeong and information about them inside the tunnel.

But I also took my time and thoroughly enjoyed the journey. The view from the top is amazing, and I recommend taking you time to look around from every angle!We decided to take the cable car up the mountain and hike back down. As we were traveling with a car we did not want to hike to the Yonghwasa temple what most people do. The trail is in the woods but it was hot at 35 degrees. Without our Kakao<U+2013>App we wouldn’t have found the trail to the valley station of the cable car at all as signs are all in Korean. It starts off from the wooden platform between the summit and the great battle viewpoint. First there are some stairs leading to a trail which forks further down into the trail to the Yonghwasa temple and the valley station of the cable car. Views from the summit are great even when the weather was misty. We visited on a busy Sunday during holiday season, but did not have to wait to go up. Parking was very busy though.Cable car ride up a mountain side. 6 can fit in a car its all very safe and looks well maintained. Costs 14k won per person for a round trip, you would have to be very athletic and have plenty time on your side to walk back down but you can buy a one way ticket at 7k won.Great views of the islands from up top and you can take steps to even higher view points once you disembark from the cable car. There is a nice viewing deck with tables and chairs above the cable car station and it has 2 glass floored wings off its deck. Scarey views of the drop below you. Theres a number of viewing scopes too.Takes around 8 minutes each way in the cable car.Beautiful scenery, but can’t beat the scenery that greets the eyes form the Jirisan hike @ Saryangdo. The plus point is this ‘san’ is so much more accessible, so those who are interested in great aerial view of the surrounding islands but lack the time, this will be a perfect choice. We cabled up and hiked down via Yonghwasa temple route. At the base, we were so famished that we ventured into one of the local eatery with fantastic food (frequented only by the locals).Simply wanted to take a cable car to see the ocean but you can enjoy little bit hike to the Mireuk mountain. Also, there is Miraesa temple near to the cable sky walk, going to Miraesa is ok but coming back to cable car to return was a bit hard cause I was exhausted after exploring mireuk mountain and the woods near to Miraesa. Anyway, worth to visit the area. You can enjoy fantastic view towards the ocean and luge track where you can hear screaming from the kids who take luge.We spent almost full day in this area, started with Luge then took cable car to the mountain. Although its so hot in summer the forest was good escape. We got our selves lost in the forest. If you wanted to reach to the temple you need to be prepared and not tired. The view from top are amazing. Highly recommendedThe cable cars are like all other cable cars I have been on. They were clean and it was cheap for a round trip, only 11,000 KRW per person. We went late Saturday afternoon and didn't have to wait in line very long. There is a lot to see at the second station with some hiking/stair climbing involved. But it is not required.CY ( 18.05.16 )We visited this mountain by Cable Car. The end of Cable car had road to top of this mountain about 15 minutes. Because of cloudy weather, we couldn't see beautiful view, but the atmosphere was good to us. We just see cloud, but good.Good to go with Family, friends and partners. Cable cart or tracking both the ways are exciting. Nice view of the city and sea. Clean, neat and aesthetic. Could be more fun in winter time. Also experience Luge sports ride no matter what age group you are. Complete one day fun for sure.This is definitely a must-see if you're in Tongyeong! I did the round trip cable car option. When you get off the cable car at the top, there is a platform with awesome veiws and a small cafe with snacks. From there, it's a short hike up to the summit of Mireuksan. It was pretty packed at the top, but you could squeeze in a few good photos."

According to some articles, The best time to visit this area is spring as I have just visited this temple in the early autumn.

We need to walk some distance as we didn't drive. However, it was a nice pleasant walk.This is an old Korea temple with quiet atmosphere in a secluded site. As we were there in the evening, we managed to see and hear the prayers in drum by the monks.The temple is located in the Hwagye-dong Valley of Hwagae-myeon, Hadong County, Gyeongsangnam-do province. It was founded in 722 but the temple was re-built in the 17th century. Nevertheless it looked a lot older than most other temples that I have seen. There were many tourists but unfortunately not many flowers. There were a few tall cherry blossom trees at the rear of the temple. I went there as part of a day tour to Hwagae cherry blossom festival.The temple is located on the southern slopes of Chirisan, surrounded by tea fields. Near the parking area is a Tea centre and Museum where you can learn more about green tea and try some as well. In Spring, the cherry trees along the road from Hwagae up to the temple (6km) are very beautiful and make a nice walk - on a week day, as the area turns into a traffic jam over the week end. It is VERY popular. If you have more time, make the 4 hour-round trip hike to Buri falls.Ssanggyesa Temple Ssanggyesa Temple in Hadong is located on the southern part of Jirisan National Park. It is said that the best time to visit here is spring since you can make a walk starting from Hwagae market place to Ssanggyesa Temple~ The pathway is filled with #Cherryblossom trees. Come and make a visit before the petals of the beautiful trees all fall~^^The temple is very serene and peaceful. When I went, there were hardly any people, mostly just the monks climbing the hill to meditate. The surrounding area grows a lot of tea and has a lot of history surrounding it. http://oldmountain.yolasite.com/tea-travels/ssanggyesa-temple-and-the-first-korean-tea-plantationsThis was a last minute visit, but I'm glad I went. Colourful lanterns were up ready for Buddha's birthday celebration, and although it was raining, it was very peaceful. There are a lot of different temples to see, and it's quite a high climb up. Definitely worth it if you're in Hadong. Quite easy to get to if you're near the Hadong bus station (not terminal - station. Number 11 from Hadong Bus Terminal)."

This was a very good atmosphere in a secluded site.The Jirisan National Park is so vast and beautiful. It was an adventure to walk around. It's definitely a must see when you visit South Korea. Spring time was the best :)Nature lovers must not miss this place about three hours away from Busan .Take a package tour for quick and easy access .Inside walking trails amidst foilage in fall colours with streams of fresh waters makes this such a lovely place .Just beautiful ..you can also do camping here ..bring water bottle along and walking stick if you wish after being properly clothed for hike with walking shoes on .This beautiful park is 472 km2 (182 sq mi); it is the first national park named in South Korea. It touches 3 cities and towns. About 45 of my coworkers and I went on a cloudy Thursday. We took a bus 2 hours outside of Daejeon. There are several pathways and trees. The location is massive and full of natural beauty, including streams and bears. It took about 1.5 hours to climb to the top and 1 hour to come down; I stopped along the way to catch my breath. There were many older people who climbed faster than me. There is a cafe, eating/sitting area and a bathroom just before you climb up to the peak. If I was not with my coworkers, I do not know that I would have ever visited this national gem. I recommend going, if you are in the area. I do not know any overnight accommodations; ours was a day trip.We ended up going here on a whim, by bus from Jinju. It was about an hour and a half ride. The park is big and has several places that are access points. I coould not really tell you which one we were at, we just got on the bus and went. We could see Mt Jirisan, which is lovely. It is an all day climb and must be begun early in the morning, with lots of water, good shoes etc. One must go in the park by late morning or they will not let you in. We did hike, not being prepared, but it was worth it just to look around.When I was in North Korea, Chilbosan, our guide there told us about the 6 legendary mountains on the Korean peninsula (5 in the North, 1 in the South). The one in the South is Jirisan. Since I was heading to South Korea after the trip in the North, they recommended me to go to Mt. Jiri. And so I did, together with my South Korean girlfriend we went in the early morning, because it could be really hot during the day. We didn't hike all the paths due the lack of time (and perhaps condition, haha), but it was a great view. Definitely recommend seeing this for yourself :)I was in Jiri San last year, where I hiked for few day along a marked way and with refuges to stay along the way. The path was magnificent and the views superb. Only problem is the booking for the refuges that must be done several weeks in advance and is often fully booked quite quickly. The koran are great hikers and very friendly.Jirisan was my favourite place in South Korea. I walked up to Cheonwangbong peak (1915m) and wished I had more time to do some serious trekking there. The mountains are sooo beautiful! Note that there are ""beware of bear"" signs everywhere though there're just 4 bears in Jirisan so not a big chance to meet one of them :-)This was simply a wonderful overnight trip. The walk up the valley was stunning with the autumn colours and with the stream pretty much an ever present companion. The terrain is rustic, not like some of the Korean walks (especially on Jeju) but easily manageable. We intended to stay at the Piagol shelter, which although described as basic, is anything but. It is one of the smaller shelters and is about 3-4 hours into the walk at a leisurely pace (we had our 8 yr old son with us). You don't need to book and it sleeps about 35 in a new wooden structure. Downstairs has separated ""rooms"" that could sleep 4, no doors. Upstairs is totally open plan flooring. . We took our own therma rests and sleeping bags but blankets can be hired for 1000 won, no sleeping mats. Overall cost was 5000 won each, bargain. There is a kettle available but only basic snacks and two tables on the deck for cooking.We dropped off our bags and continued up the valley to the ridge. This got progressively steeper and took another 1-1.5 hrs to the path junction from where you can go either direction across the ridge.The night prior to the walk we stayed at a camp ground further down the valley. Excellent shower facilities and platform sites for tents. 20000 won.Lots of different routes. We did a 2 day hike that involved staying in pension in the mountains. The hike it self was pretty special and gave a good opportunity to mingle with the locals. Make sure you check with the tourist office about which routes are open and bring your own cooking equipment."

I drove here from Seoul, it was about a 4 hour drive, but totally worth it as the views of the green hills on the drive was incredibly beautiful. The market was full of traditional vendors, and I purchased a gorgeous Soju set for my home.We took a inter- city bus to Hwagae (花<U+5F00>). About 13,000 won per person. The journey is about 2.5 hours. However, it was worth the trip as the place has several miles of cherry blossoms.I joined a day tour (with Trazy) for the Ssanggyesa Temple and the Hwagae Market cherry blossom festival in early April, after finding that there were hardly any cherry blossoms in Seoul (the flowering was late by some 2 weeks in 2017 due to cold weather). This place was new to me but the trip was very rewarding. Initially I went to Busan in late March to see the cherry blossoms in Jinhae but they were only half flourishing. Then in early April I took the KTX train to go to Seoul but was totally disappointed. My booked tour for Gyeongju was cancelled (probably due to no flowering) hence I switched to the Hwagae tour. It was a 4 hour+ bus drive from Seoul, down south. The cherry blossom road was about 4 km long and was lined with flourishing flowers. I was totally absorbed. At the end of the road there was the Hwagae Market, with many stalls selling local food and products. However, the highlight of the visit was not about the market but the amazing cherry blossoms. Definitely worth seeing.Hwagae was the set for the traditional 5-day market in the area but is now held every day, mostly for tourists. you can buy traditional medicines, green tea from the area and fruit as well as the usual things. There are a number of restaurants as well. It is mostly a stop for Korean tour buses on their way to see other attractions. From here you can admire the road up to Ssanggyesa with their cherry trees. Very busy during the season, so best avoided over the week end. But if you have time walk up the 6km on one side and down on the other side of the valley. Hwagae has buses to Hadong and Gurye, which have direct buses to Seoul (around 4.5 hours) and Gurye is also on a KTX line, but the area is worth more than a day trip.It's not frequented by international tourists, but it's definitely worthy of attention. I came to know about it when I was google-ing for the Hwagae Cherry Blosssoms Road. And since it's stated that it's a walking distance from the said road, I included it in my itinerary. Hwagae Market is actually where you get off from the bus (last bus stop). It's a simple and very clean street market and there are already abundance of cherry blossoms in the market. Everything's pretty much being sold in here.. clams, spices & roots, dried persimmons (I bet fresh persimmons are being sold during its season), pots, art works.. and yes, being in Hadong County - one of Korea's green tea county, it's where I bought one of my best buys - green tea leaves! Food is no problem as well as numerous restaurants abound in the area. Since it's pretty far from Seoul/Busan, you may want to spend at least 2-3 days here if you have the luxury of time since there's much to discover in Hadong than just Hwagae Market. it's 7.5-8 hrs bus ride from Seoul; 3.5-4 hrs from Busan. Check out visit korea's website also: http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_4_12_15_3.jspI came from Haeundae and this was my route: Haeundae Stn --> Sasang Stn. Exit 3 --> exit and walk towards Mcdonalds, the Station is beside McDonalds. It took us almost 4 hours to reach the market from Seobu Bus Station and the ticket costs W13300. I only spent an hour to roam around as I had to catch the bus back to Busan. Since you will be in a province, expect that not many can speak English, and that includes the ahjuma who is selling the ticket at the counter. The bus schedules are written in Hangul as well with no translation. You just gotta make her understand of your destination."

해인사,185건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경상남도 합천 가야면 해인사길 122 (우) 50200,1위(34곳의 합천 소재 관광지 중),"We visited on a Saturday from Daegu using public transport and having read up in advance thought the buses would be very busy. We wer pleasantly surprised how easy the trip from Daegu was although at the time we left the temple it was getting very crowded. We left from the bus station at around 10:00 *cant remember the exact time and the bus was nothing like full. we had to pay for the tickets in won as no cards were accepted (not sure if this was aglitch or usual) again had to pay for the return journey from the temple back to Daegu in cash. Tickets back were bought in the shop near where the bus terminates not at the little kiosk near the start of the walkway up to the temple. Kioask was unmanned. The bus teminus is by shops/cafes about 5 minutes walk further up the roadBy getting to the temple early although not having it to ourselves by any means.meant there were fewer toursits. Its a short up hill walk to the temple, through woods on a made up pathway so its not too hard. We spent about an hour wandering around, listing to the chanting and the drums and bells. Very relaxing place. You really cannot see the wooden printing blocks however we kindof knew this before we came. As we departed so many people started to arrive, they were quite noisy and the sheer numbers did spoil the tranquility of the temple. Its worth going to but get there early.The Haeinsa Temple is home to the Tripitaka Koreana Woodblocks - the most complete collection of Buddhists texts on 81,350 woodblocks with over 52 million characters.I visited Haeinsa from Seoul and I still think it was well worth the effort. The area and the temple itself are very beautiful and it is rather easy to get there. There's also good trails for hiking nearby.This is an easy day trip from Daegu if you don't want to do a temple stay. First go to the tourist info and get the time schedule for the bus. They are very helpful. From the subway stop, you go back around the elevator to the bus terminal. The cost 1 way was 8,100 won. They didn't take CC. The trip is easy, you will need an additional 3,000 won for the national Park ticket. When you get to the gate of the park, someone will check tickets and you can buy one. Then the first stop after this is the temple stop. You will need to give your ticket to the driver as you exit the bus. I didn't go to Haeinsa. Before leaving the stop, check the return times. There are some stores in the way up and a Cafe part way up as well. They wooden books are at the back of the temple. Worth the hike up. Just before the bus comes, a woman came out and I purchased a return ticket, again cash.Beautiful temple up in the mountains. The temple is exeptional. The Tripicata is recognised as UNESCO world heritage.A temple with 1200 years history is part of the World Heritage with his storage hall of the Tripitaka Koreana. It’s a shame the 80.000 wood blocks cannot be accessed from close distance.It is a UNESCO Heritage site. I stayed there through temple stay in first week of May 2016. There was a tea with monk session. Meals are free but you are expected to donate something on the drop box. The view around the temple is breathtaking and time moves slowly there. The silence at night - I loved it! It is the head temple of Seon Buddhism. The receptionist lady speaks English and there was another motherly old lady doing temple stay who helped me a lot.We managed to see all 3 jewels of temples in South Korea - Tongdosa near Busan that represents the Buddha because it houses the Buddha's sariras; Haeinsa near Daegu that represents the dharma because it houses the 80,000 wooden blocks of Tripitaka Koreana; and Songgwangsa near Gwangju that represents the Sanga because it's trained many famous monks. We also did a weekend temple stay program in Haeinsa. We chose it only because its schedule matched our itinerary well. However, now I must say it's an excellent choice because Haeinsa turned out to be my favorite among the 3 jewels. Just like many other temples in Korea, Haeinsa is located in a mountainous area - Gayasan to be specific. The temple ground isn't very large but the layout aligns with the natural environment very well so it has a very pleasant vibe. Most the buildings are well decorated but not overly shining. The real gem are no doubt the 4 modesty one level long buildings at the upper part of the temple ground that house the 80,000+ Tripitaka Koreana - the thousands years old wooden printing blocks of Buddhist sutras. Even though we could only glimpse between the wooden bars of the building walls, I still felt so precious knowing that I was so close to these invaluable treasures.The group of the people took part in the temple stay program was larger than I expected. Also a little surprisingly, probably two third of the 40+ people were local Koreans. Our host monk only speaks Korean but an English speaking staff was helping with translation. Although I got an overall understanding of what's going on, I could also tell what the English speaking staff said was lot less than what the monk had said. Nonetheless, it was an enjoyable experience overall. The drum ceremony at the evening and dawn was wonderful, the practice of prostration (full bow) was great moving meditation; sitting meditation was a bit short but probably suited most foreigners; the most amazing part was chanting - we had absolutely no clue what was chanted but because many fellow Korean participants actually know the chant so when everyone chanted together with the monks it's very powerful. The 1.5 hour guided temple tour was good as well. We heard many interesting stories and noticed some things we won't be able to notice if we walked around by ourselves. After the program finished in the following morning, we set out to hike Gayasan just behind Haeinsa. But after about 1.5 hours when we managed to hike up to the stone craved standing buddha statute, it seems the trail has disappeared into the bush. We tried a little further beyond the ""no trail"" sign but found that the trail became very steep, not well trodden and just didn't feel right. Reluctantly we decided to turn around and go back down to the temple. We were a little disappointed that we were unable to reach the summit of Gayasan, but the trek to the standing buddha is not bad. in fact when we arrived the standing buddha a group of devotees were chanting there, the atmosphere was so special.We did a one night temple stay at Haeinsa and were utterly disappointed. It was a commercial exercise where several of us were accommodated in tiny ensuite rooms. We were herded around like school children in single file to the temple where we witnessed some prayers and chanting and the temple stay monk spoke in Korean while the interpreter was, sadly, very poor in translating that she generally said one sentence to every paragraph he spoke. It was a meaningless exercise. And when it rained, the tour of the premises was cancelled. The buildings themselves are stunning. Hundreds of tourists descend by the busloads to see the place. Its a victim of its own success.For us, unfortunately, there was no spiritual vibe to the place.I attended the regular week-end templestay program, I expected much better from the templestay :The monk was not speaking English. A translator was trying to translate but the monk kept interrupting her, showing no form of respect !The food was exactly the same for dinner and breakfast, not good, when monks had better dishes.Rain was expected for the second day but the temple tour was not anticipated, therefore the second day program was limited to prostrations and silence.No activity unlike said on the internet (no lantern making or religious object).Disappointed..."

갓바위,29건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경상북도 경산 와촌면,1위(20곳의 경산 소재 관광지 중),"Gatbawi is a good half-day excursion from Daegu but be prepared for some serious climbing! There's a map at the bottom but frankly it wasn't terribly helpful, I just followed other people. There are two ways up. The path initially heads up in one direction from the bus stop/car park. A short way up there's some stone steps off the right - take these if you want. Both the main path and the narrower path the steps lead to go past two temples before the path really diverges; one small temple and one much bigger one a little higher up. The main route up to the Buddha statue is off to the left of this larger temple, and leads up a long flight of even stone stairs. Once you're on the stairs you can't get lost. The other route is off to the right (climb up through the temple and there's a gate on the right-hand side). This is a little more of a hike with less well-defined steps and I think it's slightly longer, but the ultimate height gain is the same! There were a couple of forks towards the top, just stay left. At the top there's an area for praying and a little shop selling trinkets and water, and a toilet. Various other paths lead off into the mountains but I would recommend being properly equipped with food and water before trying those. It was a cloudy, windy day when I did this and the views were hazy but I suspect on a clear day they'd be fantastic. There is a good sense of achievement at the top and it is a very spiritual place especially with everyone praying.I was one of the few non Koreans up there and to be truthful, it's not an easy climb up there. there were tons of steps that you need to conquer but the view up there was amazing. felt amazing to see how many devotees made the effort to go all the way up to pray!Steps! Sooo many steps but the hike takes only about 30 minutes each way ( depending on your level of fitness and whether or not you stop at the temple, etc) You can skip the steps and take the route on the other side. Less steps and more hiking up a mountain type feel. Check out the souvenir shop just past the bowing area/stone buddha. Over the years, I've gotten quite a few cute/cool things thereThe views were gorgeous and the top was an amazing site. There are temples off to the side and along the trail. Make sure to bring a little cash so you can buy a trinket at the top as a memory!A good hike. It can be challenging for some. It can be demanding in some areas. But nonetheless it was great.Long hike up the mountain. Several ways up, including a less-traveled route toward the top. Use that was to see additional temples. Be sure you have a good-weather day to view the Buddha at the top. Make sure you come down the correct way or you'll wind up at the bottom on the wrong side of the mountain.It gets steeper as you are closer to the peak, but worth the effort. Great view from the top and the statue is one of its kind.If you like stair challenges then this trip is for you! The incline on the mountain is so punishing so take water. The buddha/view from the top is still worth the hike. Be prepared to take the hour long bus ride from Daegu in order to reach it.Well, I believe that this place is by far the most remembering and exiting in Korea. It situated at the top of the Gatbawi mounting, I did my best to climb there, approximately 1500 steps. But at the top you can find the Buddha statue and a lot of praying people. I'm not a Buddhist but this place is really exiting. So peaceful place, it is really crucial part of my Korea trip. I will strongly recommend everybody to visit this place.This is Budda, most famous for praying. You can pray when you have a big event : promotion, exam, getting a job etc. You have to clime the mountain to peak to visit here. All stairs. Nevertheless, here is very famous place. You are real Korean lover if you visit here."
양동 민속 마을,232건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경상북도 경주 강동면 양동리 (우) 780-914,7위(73곳의 경주 소재 관광지 중),"1. I wanted to see something historic.So Yandong Village did not disappoint me as many of the ancient village houses were preserved.2. Some of the traditional village e.g. Bukchon Village in Insadong, Seoul - are actually restored to replicate its historic style - and are now occupied by present day residents.The Yangdong Village is not restored in that sense.3. Learnt a bit of the Korean culture in history - like their fermenting of Kimchi in large pots, a pole is placed across their gate to signify that visitors are not to enter, we can recognise the status of the occupants from the different roof types on their housesNot sure how the poorer folks back then survive the severe cold in winter.4. Great photo taking opportunity to remember our time in Koreadisappointment because walk around at village hillside and look at the outside of the buildings onlyWorth a visit here. You see lots of old houses as you wander around the pathways but you can’t enter any. Loved the thatched roofs and plenty of persimmon trees full of fruit! Would suggest visiting out of season as we did as we did so it wasn’t too crowded.Having visited other living villages or towns that are similarly UNESCO World Heritage Site listed, we were left unimpressed with the sights in Yangdong Village. This is a living residential area with numerous houses sprawled across numerous hills, and residents going about with their daily activities. And that is it.It was a short half day trip from Gyeongju with a mixture of taxi and bus. Other than having visited another UNESCO listed location, there were not any memorable sights in this village.I spent a pleasant hour and a half wandering around the village enjoying the architecture but my husband was bored and hated it. I recommend stopping by the small museum to learn more about the village's history. Be prepared, it's very hilly so walking around is definitely a work out. The bus 203 only runs about once an hour so make sure to check out the schedule to help plan your visit.We visited Yangdong-ri Folk Village on a drizzly, gray day...perhaps the perfect day to wander around out of the sun. The existing, ancient dwellings were a marvel of classic Korean style architecture and construction that has lasted for centuries. The lotus pond was in bloom, making it even more beautiful. I think this is a must-see if you’re in the area.My family of eight visited Yangdong Folk Village in June 2019. We hired a driver to take us from Gyeongju and he waited while we visited the village. They provide English tour guides who are quite knowledgable. What's interesting about this village is that it is still lived in. From the outside you see an old structure with a straw roof but if you look around the back you see air conditioners and satellite dishes. Apparently the current inhabitants are descendants of the original village dwellers. The village is quite large and you need several hours to see it all.My family especially enjoyed the archery corner. We paid extra for this and it was great. Wear good shoes as there is a lot of walking and some very steep terrain.This was the most expensive sightseeing thing I have been to in Gyeongju and probably my least favourite. In saying that it is easy to get to on the 203 bus which starts by the inter city terminal .. but on the road side. Costs 4000 won to get in but there is free tour guides available including English speaking. This was really good otherwise I would have been quite lost .. the map did not seem informative either. Lovely village to wander through.Quite hilly and paths that can get steep but such an amazing demonstration of traditional Korean houses, both tile roof and thatched. Stunningly restored!It's a great looking village, and it's a nice place to take a walk. There weren't many tourists there."

보문 관광 단지,83건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경상북도 경주 신평동,18위(73곳의 경주 소재 관광지 중),"Tourists who are mostly elderly or do not frequent travel make up the majority.So overall the price is expensive.There are many street vendors selling bad food that are difficult to see in tourist complexes.It is inconvenient for them to walk around the lake.주로 연로하거나 자주 여행을 다니지 않는 관광객들이 주를 이룸.그래서 전반적으로 가격이 비쌈.관광단지에는 보기 힘든 불량식품을 파는 노점상들이 많음. 이들로 인해 호수가 주변을 걷기가 불편함.I believe Bomun Lake is natural, but the areas surrounding the lake are filled with your usual resort attractions, theme park, shopping, etc. This is probably a destination resort area for your Korean family during the summer. I went there in early November and the place is quite empty at that time. I could imagine the place is absolutely crowded in the summer due to the number of resort hotels and theme park attractions in the area. The duck boats and other attractions were closed/not operational at the time I went though.The area around the lake is quite beautiful though, with plenty of walking trails surrounding the lake. I also saw many people walking their dogs on the trails/walkways as well. The lake itself seemed to be quite clean. The place is worth a brief look and would be ideal as a resort vacation in the summer. However, it is probably not worth much of a visit by the foreign traveler as it is a place you can probably see at home or your typical resort in your home country.We didn't stay here. But glad of that.This must be a lovely place to visit when the weather is good and you need a respite from urban life. But our view of the area, from bus #10 heading to Bulguksa Temple, convinced us that this was really not the right place for us to stay and we're glad we stayed in Gyeongju.As we wandered around Gyeongju at night and stumbled across a fantastic festival, saw the illuminated burial mounds and enjoyed the town's nightlife, we commented to each other that we would have missed all of this if we'd stayed 'at the lake'. If a lake, resort holiday is your attraction to Gyeongju, then this complex must be the right place to meet your needs. If you're here to see some of the history of the area and experience Gyeongju then staying in town would be a better choice. I guess you could mix the two but that wasn't our reason to be there. Just sayin'.I enjoyed Gyeongju international music festival at Bomun lake outdoor theater during 4th to 7th August.  The pathway is good for walking around the lake.This is a resort area with a capital R. There are all sorts of entertainment activities and countless eateries in a really beautiful location. Great for all ages and groups with many hotels at a wide range of price points. The duck boat rentals and little electric cars for the kiddies are corny but very fun.but if you're staying in the neighborhood, and the weather is nice, treat yourself to a stroll around the lake.Visited in the spring, there were a lot of people picnicking and kids, also cute dogs running around, nothing too noisy though. Atmosphere is nice, my friend and I had earlier bought a big box of strawberries and sat on one of the many benches around, enjoying the great weather there that day. There is a bridge connecting to the theme park as well.This lake is very big. It will take more than one hour to walh around it. There are lots of hotels, resaurants, or cafes. Yon can paddle boats or walk or jog around the lake. There iare an amusement park, Millenium Park, or golf courses near the lake.If you want to have a fake Traditional Korean experience and pay inflated prices, then Bomun is for you. The surrounding park is lovely year-round, but all the restaurants and fake hanok-style buildings drape the ugly commercialism of Korea onto things that could otherwise be enjoyable.The trail around the lake is the best thing in this area. The second thing is probably the outdoor theater which unfortunately we didn't get to enjoy. Information on the performances was not readily available. Well, the hotel concierge was not aware of it even though we saw a poster in Korean showing the schedule of shows. Last and the worst part of the lake was the swan boat -- an eyesore! Tacky boats!"

문경새재 도립공원,50건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경상북도 문경,1위(16곳의 문경 소재 관광지 중),"Beautiful, large mountains surround the vast, lush area. Not much attractions, but it's nice for a walk or trekking. Paths are easy to find with restrooms here and there. Long walk from 1st gateway to 3rd, but the trail is not difficult. There are plenty of traditional Korean food choices in the entrance area.We came here for the apple festival in October. It started down pouring so we did not get to enjoy it as much as we'd like. This place looks very nice and we hope to go back someday.The entrance area and main attractions are crowded as heck, but the trails leading into the mountains are a little easier to handle. I particularly liked the 2 km walk up to Haeguk Temple (it is on the map). The temple is modest, but has some really wonderful art.This is a historic highway between Southern and Capital (Seoul), an old highway is preserved and opened as a trekking route. Walking into the unspoiled forest with many stones etched old Korean poems, waterfalls, model houses of old post house and tea houses, historic site. Trekking takes about 3 hours and walking from North to South maybe easier because of longer descending.Well reserved old castles older than 500 years. It was the path way for Japanese Invasion in 1592.I went to this place in late Oct and the autumn foliage and scenery was really beautiful. From Seoul, go to DongSeoul bus terminal to take the intercity bus to Mungyeong Bus terminal. It takes 2 hours. Then take a local bus to Mungyeong Sanjae. Just buy the ticket from the bus terminal office. It costs 1500\ and roughly 10min. The area has 3 historical gates and from gate 1 to 3 is approx 6.5km. The hike is not difficult as there is no stairs or stones to climb. However from gate 2 to 3, it gets much steeper. I feel the best scenery are between gate 1 to 2. As such if you are already tired after gate 2, suggest you turn back after gate 2. There is also a KBS drama city built in this area and periodic dramas such as Chuno, Iljimae, etc were produced here. In all there are a lot more in this area and it's a pity I arrived late and could not explore further. It's now one of my favorite places in Korea.C1 ( 2015.04.25 ) This park was very beautiful view, and many people walking though road. This park's road could pass big 3 old gate, and walk some trail. In the park, there was mesuem, drama set place, and some attraction. Especially, I felt good walking with smell, sight, air. Excellent park..This is a beautiful park that is well kept. The trails to the gates are well paved and easy to walk. This is a must-see in Mungyeong.Here people can enjoy Korean history, culture, drama open set & deliciouse food.Specailly Autumn fall foliage is really beautiful.

It is a nice place to walk for an hour if you are into that sort of thing. I'm no historian, but I guess they represent various periods of Korea's history. For a small charge you can dress up like a historical monarch and pose for a picture on a throne. Admission was just a few thousand won.Such a good place to visit if u want to know further about KDRAMA historical scenes. Hahaha I enjoyed here b I enjoyed the Rail Road Bike in Munyeong too.It's amazing to see such realistic built up for drama and they have even 'cloned' Guanghwamun here. I just feel they should probably have more signs indicating which famous drama scenes were taken from which settings. Anyway I didn't explore the whole area but it was well worth the 2000\ entrance fee.C1 ( 2015.04.25 ) This place was located between Mungyeong Saejae Provincial Park's gate 1 and gate 2.

안동하회마을,400건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경상북도 안동 풍천면 하회리,1위(35곳의 안동 소재 관광지 중),"We took the bus from Gyeongyu to Andong, an hour and half ride and another bus to the village and yet another 5 minutes shuttle to the village. Quite a well preserved village where people still live in the houses. We also watched the face mask performance. As with many Korean sites, there are not many information in English and we missed the shuttle back to the main bus terminal. Do pay attention to the timing of the limited buses.We took the bus from just in front of the Andong railway station (opposet side of the road), paid the standard fare and were there in about an hour. Tickets bought we would advise having a look at the mask museum first to avoid any back tracking. Around the museum there are a few shopa stc and toilets. We then took the free shuttle to the edge of tha village. We chose not to hire a mobility type scooter as we felt we needed a walk. You can spent at least a couple of hours just walking around the village, popping into the open houses. We had a our picnic lunch (brought from Andong) on the banks of the river. We were told that the ferry across the river was no longer in operation so we did not get the village view from the other side. We stayed to watch the mask dance which is just outside the village , had a drink. did a bit more walking before catching the bus back to Andong. If you catch the bus from near the maks festival theatre you are more likely to get a seat.Gresat day out in wonderful sunny weather.This folk village is simply beautiful. Surrounded by the river the place is well preserved and is authentic. We just simply loved walking around this village.Unlike many other sites of this nature this one has no cast of simulating performers. This is a real historic village but it is lived in by modern day people. The houses are authentic: traditional mud stucco, with thatched roofs denoting the lesser villagers and tiles denoting the wealthy. The Sth Koreans have managed visitor access very well. You park and then travel in by bus. There is a museum paying tribute to a noted citizen and a cultural performance which had the native language speakers in stitches. We don’t normally go in for fake “cultural “ shows for tourists but this was more along the lines of the old English style mummers plays put on by travelling troupes of entertainers.Andong Hahoe Folk Village is the place to go to see how Koreans lived in the past. The village is quite big and it's easy to lose your way even with maps provided. If you are in the area, it's worth a visit. They do have scooters for hire.As with a lot of tourist places in Korea, theres a fair bit of guess work involved in where to go and best place to park up. This village is no different, if you want to avoid a lengthy walk from the car park, just keep on passing the car parks on the right until a parking official indicates you can't go any further.This village is a residential place and only residents can get their cars all the way in. Us tourists have to go on foot or buy a cheap travel ticket at a glass kiosk about 100 meters walk from the last car park. There you can jump on a pink single decker bus that will take you into the village. Otherwise its about a 1km walk.Inside you can opt to wander around by foot or hire a 2 seater electric bike or a 5 seater electric buggy. Take the buggy the Trikes are dog slow.There are many small shops selling handy crafts and tourism trinkets. There are a few cafes and restaurants. On an evening during Mask Festival there is a fire works display by the river, starts at 7pm ish. We didn't hang around but those that did told us later it was a good event.Its a place worth going to but I doubt I would go back.This village gives a snapshot of the lives of the people in the early days of the Korean history. You will need to spend at least half a day to cover most part of the village/This is why you decide to get off the Soul to Busan route. Andong is a cultural gem, and being an ancient city, the food everywhere you eat is AMAZING. Hahoe Village is the number 1 attraction, and a perfect visual example of eastern style flow and harmony. Thevillage is amazing, and features one house that has been lived in continuously by the same family going back almost a millennium. Fair warning, go early to avoid the traffic!This traditional village is UNESCO world heritage and it's easy to understand why. This village takes you back in time and shows lots of traditional houses from an era that has long since passed. Hahoe truly is a beautiful village situated in gorgeous natural surroundings, but it is very touristic. Personally I really didn't like all the tourists riding on electric scooters through this otherwise peaceful village. The experience would be way more authentic without those scooters. I also had some doubts when seeing some of the modifications made by the inhabitants (clearly visible air conditioning and satellite dishes).The Village offers a lot of historical homes and grounds to visit. Also the site of the Mask Museum, which is worth the time to include in the visit. It's a little confusing about bus returns to town, but everyone there is very helpful. We bought a beautiful mask at one of their shops."

Much of it is in English which is not very common so it was good getting detailed information on the origins of the masks used in Korean culture especially. A summary of the various performances, the storyline and characters was given. The 'yamban' (aristocrat) seemed to be used frequently as a figure of ridicule and criticism while the priest, old woman (usually wronged and ill-treated when the husband takes a concubine) and servants play important roles.Masks from other cultures were also displayed and their significance explained. The Japanese Noh drama (video of dances) was succinctly explained while the significance of the lion in chasing away evil spirits in Chinese folklore was pointed out. Southeast Asian dances with masks as in the Balinese Barong were discussed together with more remote regions like the Maldives, the South Pacific and Maori and Native American cultures.There's a small souvenir shop and coffee shop at the exit before you go off the Hahoe Village or take bus No. 246 back to the Andong terminal.Your entrance to the folk village in Hahoe cover entrance here. Its a modern building with a number of masks from around the world. Its worth calling in here before you walk around the vilage.This museum has a very complete display of many eras and countries of folks masks, with a very appropriate representation of Korean, but covering many other countries and cultures, as well. Well worth a visit, as part of a visit to the Andong Hakoe Folk Village.Nice place to visit. Not too big, with a lot of funny masks to see, and also how they make them out of a simple piece of wood. You can learn the story behind the masks. We have a very nice sample of the couple, got it as a present from our Korean friends, and hanging in the living room and still enjoy every day.Very interesting and informative museum. Wonderful masks from different places. Great imagination and skill. Highly recommended.If you’re interested in traditional/ethnographic art this museum is quite interesting with a large collection of masks from Korea (mostly) and from around the world. Some nice pieces from the Pacific Islands and even a few masks from Africa. Interestingly, and uncommonly, most explanations are in English too, which is a rare but very welcome bonus.The Mask Museum is by the car park where you buy the tickets for Andong Hahoe Folk Village. Entrance is free and as well as having masks from the region, they also have masks from all over the world. There are actually 300 Korean masks and over 30 other countries have contributions.A small museum with a great collection of Korean masks. It takes about an hour to walk through and it’s well worth the visit.and try not to miss a mask dance performance in Hahoe. fun and interesting.    The area is lovely and the mask museum is quite extensive.This was actually the highlight of our visit to Hahoe. The entrance here is included in the price of the entrance to the village (5000KRW) and it is actually a very good museum with a lot of very beautiful masks from around the world and a reasonable amount of information given in English. Worth going to if you have made the effort to visit Hahoe from Andong."

울릉도,42건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경상북도 울릉,1위(9곳의 울릉 소재 관광지 중),"If you are spending any considerable amount of time in Korea, Ulleung-do is a must visit! The views across the islands were magnificent and the people were friendly throughout. Overall it was a great experience. A few tips for foreign travelers however. First, you can only access the island by ferry boat. We had some Korean friends help us with the booking since all the sites are in Hangul. Second, the ferry boat may or may not run depending on weather and booking conditions. We had our port changed at the last minute due to an under-booked return leg. The ferry company worked it our for us, but the risk of weather changing your itinerary is real. I would allot at least one buffer day on both ends of your trip. The third major recommendation is to be comfortable with basic Hangul or have a good translation app. Our Hangul is admittedly not the best, and the amount of english signage or english spoken on the island is very limited. We relied heavily on Google Translate to get us around - but people were very understanding of it. Fourth - Ulleung-do is bigger than it looks. Most of the websites online mention the intermittent bus schedules and that was our original plan. If we had continued on that route, we would not have seen 10% of the island based on time. While the distances are not great, the road structure on the island makes for very long transit times on the buses. Taxis are an option in the major towns of Dodong and Jeodong, but hailing one away from one of the hubs is highly unlikely. After a failed first day of buses and taxis (we travel with our two young children), we coordinated with our hotel for a private tour. This was absolutely the best way for us to see the entire island. Our guide (Onnuri Tour) was great - his English was about as good as our Hangul, but that was a great starting point. From there he used Google Translate and drove us to every single destination on the island. We were allowed to explore at our own pace throughout the day he made great recommendations throughout. We had such a good time that we continued with the company on the second day for the cruise around the island, and he continued to show us places that we would never have seen had we adhered to the bus plan. Overall, the trip was well worth the effort of getting there, and at the top of our list for all the places we had visited during our time here in Korea.While living in South Korea, I went to visit a small remote island in the East Sea called Ulleungdo. While the trip itself was smooth and uneventful, my attempt to return to the mainland peninsula was a different story.It was the week before Labor Day weekend in Daegu, South Korea and I was nearing the end of my tour of living in South Korea after nearly 8 months. During my time, I had been nearly everywhere on the Korean peninsula as well as the well-known Jeju Island off the southern tip. The upcoming weekend would be my last opportunity to explore somewhere new before I returned to the United States. After days of researching and asking around, I discovered Ulleung Island (or Ulleungdo) through a Korean translator that I worked with. He told me that while the island was relatively unknown amongst foreigners, it was considered a “go-to” destination for locals. Upon further research, I discovered that unlike other destinations in South Korea, the Ulleungdo tourism page was entirely in Korean. I immediately knew this was the type of place where I could get immersed in the local Korean culture without the westernized filters. 2 days later I was on my way to the coastal city of Pohang. Ulleungdo was small enough to where there was no commercial airport and the only way on and off the island was through a ferry. After staying the night in Pohang, I arrived at the Pohang ferry terminal bright and early ready to start my next adventure. Pohang was one of three terminals which had ferry’s that went to Ulleungdo. It was extremely busy and crowded and I was one of the last people to get a ticket for the first ferry going out. The weather was sunny and there was no absolutely no wind (this will be important later on). The ferry was spacious, and the seats were comfortable. While the boat had limited entertainment options (no Wi-fi and only Korean speaking soap operas), my 3-hour journey was filled with excitement and anticipation. The boat arrived in Ulleungdo and there was an immediate scramble for the exit by the ferry passengers. After pushing my way through large families and ferry employees, I was greeted by the salty air of the Dodong port. I walked up towards the dock and made my way towards the center of town. After trying 5 hotels, I was able to settle into a local bed & breakfast and prepare for my Ulleungdo adventure.After 3 fun and exciting days in Ulleungdo, I was more than ready to go back to Daegu. I had planned on taking the first shuttle back to Pohang on Sunday morning at 9 AM. I woke up and quickly packed my bag. As I was checking out of the hotel, the owner told me that the weather wasn’t looking good for the day. Not really understanding what that meant I gathered my things and waved down a taxi. Even though the taxi’s on Ulleungdo were the most expensive in South Korea, I gave the taxi driver a majority of my cash and asked that he take me to the ferry terminal located in the next village over. The driver looked slightly confused but took me anyway. When I arrived, the terminal was completely empty. Although I was about a half-an-hour early, there wasn’t even a ferry docked for loading. All the doors were locked, and confusion began to set in. After about 10 minutes of walking around, I decided to catch the local bus back to Dodong, the town I had initially stayed in. By the time I had arrived back to Dodong, it was running pretty hard and the wind had picked up significantly. I found my way to the police station where the only person that was there was a 65-year old Korean man that spoke no English. After 10 minutes of attempting to communicate with him, I gave up and called the Korean Tourism Hotline where I could talk to someone that I could understand. Without mincing their words, the agent told me the ferry would not be coming today and that they were unsure when it would come because there were two typhoons off the coast of southern Japan. For those that are confused, you must understand that this was a time period where the South Korean government was particularly sensitive to ferry accidents. A year earlier, in 2014, the MV Sewol sank killing 304 people (most who were high school students). While the captain of the ferry was eventually found guilty of murder for abandoning the ship, there was significant backlash against the South Korean government due to their perceived failure to enforce comprehensive safety standards. It became evident that the overcautious of approach by the South Korean transportation ministry concerning my situation was connected to that event. As I left the police station, I faced another issue. I only had the equivalent to $25 USD in Korean Won (KW). While I had plenty of money in my bank account, actually being able to access it was the issue. Before leaving Pohang, I had withdrawn about 300,000 KW ($300 USD) to bring as emergency money. Even though Ulleungdo was an isolated island in the pacific, there were still 4 banks on it, so I figured there would be no issue in getting cash if necessary. However, as luck would have it, I arrived during the first week that all Ulleungdo banks required foreign debit cards to have a chip in order to access the ATM. Unfortunately, neither one of my debit cards had a chip and I would be unable to withdraw any cash during the trip. I also had to immediately pay 55,000 KW ($50 USD) to the hotel owners when I arrived to cover my stay. I then budgeted the remaining money to cover the three days on the island. However, with my stay being extended, I barely had enough money to cover another night in a hotel. After sitting in shock for 20 minutes, I finally went back to the hotel that I had stayed at, and gave my last bit of money to check back in. I told the owner of my situation, and they said they could help me out. We ended up going to a restaurant which they co-owned and they charged $200 USD to my debit card and gave me the equivalent in Korean Won. This provided me much needed relief and I was very grateful for their willingness to help me out. In addition, I was given free meals on at least 2 occasions by local restaurant owners who sympathized with my situation. For the next four days, I woke up and went directly to the ferry office. It was not until the fourth day when I would finally be informed that a ferry would be heading back to the mainland peninsula the following morning. Sure enough, the next morning the ferry was sitting on the dock and the terminal was buzzing. What started as a three-day weekend vacation turned into 8 days of being stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. However, none of that mattered as I finally boarded the ferry and headed back towards Pohang ready to take on my next adventure.There is a walking trail along the coast and you can walk from one peninsula to the end of it. You pass along a lot of great spots and areas along the coast and Ulleungdo is one of them. Picturesque and a nice view.A stunningly beautiful island, yet unspoilt, probably because of the effort to get there - a 3.5 hour drive from Seoul followed by a 3 hour ferry ride, which can be choppy so be prepared if you get sea sick. Was lucky to go with a Korean friend who booked a local package with Hana tours (return ferry ticket, 2 nights’ accommodation, tours and some meals) for around USD300 which was great value. Although the tour was conducted in Korean, you can read up on the sights in advance. The tour bus drives you to sights with adequate time to hike or take in the sights around the island without feeling you are rushed. Highlight was the Haengnam Coastal walking path, a paved path which hugs part of the coast and offers beautiful sights. If the ferry is operating, you can also visit Dokdo, an island occupied by Korea but whose possession is disputed by Japan. The Dokdo museum on Ulleung island explains the history of the dispute. The cable car ride to see the island from the top was another highlight. Hotel accommodation arranged by the tour was basic but adequate and the meals provided were good, comprising mainly of seafood since fishing (mainly squid) is the main industry. Construction work for an airport in Ulleung is scheduled to commence in 2019 and be completed by 2022. Well worth a visit before it is developed!I have traveled Ulleungdo extensively and it is one of the most beautiful places I've ever been to. I'm even writing a series on towns in Ulleungdo. From amazing ocean views to beautiful primeval forests and soaring cliffs, this tiny island has everything.3-4 hours by ferry from the mainland it can be difficult to get to, especially with the weather on the East Sea being so variable. But it is well worth the effort to get there!Ulleungdo is a beautiful rocky island about 120 km east of the port of Hupo in North Gyeongsang province on the Korean Peninsula and about 80 km north-east of the disputed island of Dokdo. Dokdo can only be visited about 50 days a year due to rough seas. Ulleungdo is a volcanic island that used to be a refuge for seals and whales before they were hunted to extinction. Now it’s known for its squid, which may also soon become rare or even extinct due to overfishing. The island itself has some nice resorts and can be circumambulated by bus. Make sure to also visit Jukdo which is only a short ferry ride away. Climb all 365 steps to its summit to enjoy the view! A typical souvenir from Ulleungdo is Pumpkin taffy. The small towns on the island are not particularly interesting, but offer the basic necessities. The island has no sandy beaches but affords great views. Excessive development may soon turn the place into a ‘theme park’ and destroy its natural beauty and remote charm. Best to visit soon before it’s overrun by masses of package tourists!Friendly, small, clean, natural.The entire island can be driven around in a total of an hour and a half, but there are tons of things to do, whether you enjoy eating local food or visiting natural attractions.This island is a wonderful place to visit but you really need to be flexible for the departure date. When I visited, the ferry to Mukho operated but not the one to Pohang. Some people I met on the island had been stranded on the island for three days. My ferry from Mukho to Ulleung was extremely choppy, lots of people vomited. I could neither take a nap nor read / watch a video as both of them made me extremely dizzy. I couldn’t even take a bottle of water from the bag the whole 3 hour journey as I felt so sick. But when I returned from Ulleung to Pohang, the journey was very comfortable. I guess the boat from Mukho was smaller and that might be the reason. Another information I gathered was the ferry companies decide whether they run or not at 7am each morning. In extreme condition, they can already decide the evening before. If the ferry for the day is not operating, the ferry ticket booth doesn’t open and it’s hard to get information as the people at the tourist booth don’t speak much English. To my disappointment, the boat to Dokdo and the one goes around the island didn’t operate while I was there. Not sure if they suspended these services for good or just for the week. The road from Dodong to Jeodong was closed too. I could only walk from Dodong to the lighthouse or from Jeodong to the first bridge. I was first attracted to visit Ulleung-do because of the spiral stairs between Jeodong and Dodong but the spiral stairs could only be seen far away from Jeodong. It took a long time for the local people to recognise these spiral steps, so I guess it was broken for a long time.The cable car in Dodong was not operating for one or two people. I was rejected in the morning at 9:30am, saying that the wind was too strong, but when I walked down the hill, I met a group of tourists and then I saw the cable car was running 15 minutes later. I guess if you want to go on the cable car, you need to wait and follow the large groups. Don’t go there too early in the morning as most Korea tourists won’t start their day till 10-11am.I stayed there for three nights and arrived at noon, leaving at 3:30pm three days later. During the ‘three’ days, I relied only on public transportation and it was enough. Most Korean tourists rent a car when they arrive or hire a car for the days. As the timetable was not so frequent, the following itineracy would help most tourists to visit most important sties. Honestly, it would be good to have 7 days on the island and enjoy it to the full. Day 1 (half day as I think most ferries arrive at around noon) - Take the bus timetable (ask the girls to tell you which Korean words means Dodong/Jeodong/Cheonbu-ri/Nari) and the maps (both Korean and English) from the Tourism office first. Take a bus going directly to Cheonbu-ri (north of the island). Sit on the left side of the bus as you can absorb the wonderful scenery along the way. It takes around 50min to an hour. Then take another bus to Gwaneumdo Island entrance. It costs 5000won to enter and cross the bridge. Gwaneumdo is a beautiful place where you can see Jukdo island from it. There are a few picnic areas. It takes around 45min to an hour to visit Gwaneumdo. When finishing Gwaneumdo, take the bus back to Cheonbu-ri and then take the ‘ ound' the island bus back to Taeha where there is a lighthouse. I personally didn’t visit Taeha but I got the information from some hikers. On the English guide map, it says ‘One of the top ten views in Korea’, people told me that the sunset view from it was spectacular. There is a monorail too, but I didn’t have enough time to visit. As the sunset is between 5-7pm, there should be enough time to catch the last bus back to Dodong for dinner.FYI, there is not much to see in Cheonbu-ri, not even a proper coffee shop, but it is a place for bus transfer to either Gwaneumdo or Nari. There is an underwater observatory in Cheonbu-ri which costs 4000won. It brings you to 6 metre down the water to see some fishes, but as the price indicates, there is not much to see. I went there for a quick look as I was waiting for the next bus. Day 2 - If you have a full day, then a hike up the highest peak would be nice. You can visit Nari on the way back too. I made a mistake as I visited Gwaneumdo and Nari on the same day, so I ended up visiting Nari twice and missed Taeha. Girls from the tourist booth told me to catch a taxi which costs 12000w to KBS Relay Station Trail (But the taxi I jumped on asked for 10000won only). From there, it was a three-hour hike up Seonginbong (986.7m). I am a female solo traveller and I found no difficulty going there alone as the trails are nicely paved. Remember to bring enough water as there are no shops along the way. The forest in between is ancient. I stopped from time to time to admire the tall naive trees and ferns. It was a less-than-three-hour hike up. I took less than 4 hours to go up and down. Although the Tourism office told me to do down via the monastery trail, I guessed the Nari trail would be more direct (the taxi driver also told me to go down that way too). One more thing, remember to continue after reaching the peak (Seonginbong) as there a small trail behind the stone which leads you to the see the Nari basin. The downward trail to Nari is extremely easy as there are lots of stairs only. I met some hikers going up from Nari and it was a tough task. Nari basin is the only flat land in Ulleung and there is so much sunshine in it, unlike the windy path along the coast. There is a restaurant in Nari which serves fried eggs with vegetables (at least some friendly Koreans shared this with me there!) and you can get something some local food before heading back to Cheonbu-ri, and then to Dodong.Day 3 - I think leaving Dodong and Jeodong and the Haengnam coastal walk to the last half day is the best as you won’t miss the afternoon ferry because of the bus delay. Don’t miss the Haengnam Coastal Walk as it was the highlight of my trip. The turquoise water and the rosy-coloured stones are magnificent! In Dodong, don’t miss the Dokdo Museum as they have a collection of ancient maps and it’s interesting to see the facts presented by Korea. There was an American called Humphrey Leynse who stayed on Ulleung-do for three years during 1966-69 and made some wonderful black-and-white documentaries which were shown in the Museum.I was reflecting my journey and if I had done the trip like the above, I would have saved a day to see more. However, I couldn’t get more information before I arrived. I tried a few local restaurants and found the one on the right of CU (not the one next to CU, but the one on top of the road) in Dodong wins. I spot a lot of Korean went to eat there, so I followed. I tried mussel fried rice (15000won) there and it was excellent. The side dishes were very different from the other restaurants in that area.Uleungdo is beautiful, Ive visited it a lot island in Korea and this one takes the trophy. It lacks sandy beaches but the coast line of volcanic rock and clear waters accompanied with steep rock cliffs are beautiful. From the interior of the island you have beautiful views of the coastline and the coastal drive is beautiful. There is a lot this island could market instead of rocks that supposedly look like things and I expect in the future, especially with the building of an airport they will. Get theer now while it is still quiet and before it is relatively untouched still.Ulleung island is quite out of the way for people who don't speak or read Korean but if you can make it there, it is definitely worth your while. Tourists are mainly local and can be quite crowded during Korea's holiday season. There are many unique volcanic rock formations (e.g. Turtle rock, Elephant Rock, Needle Peak, Old Man Peak), Bongnae falls and the view of Ulleung island from nearby Jukdo is a must, simply because its scenery is just breathtaking. You can also bus to Taeha for lookout point close to the lighthouse (take monorail up and then short hike). The Haengnam Coastal walk via Dodong is a must-do, the walk can lead you to Jaedong port but when we went in May 2017, half the coastal walk was closed as the bridges needed maintaining. You can still walk to Jaedong from halfway but it is via an uphill and downhill hike (about 30 min without stopping) along the old trail. You can also hike up to Nari basin (via Cheonbu and change to smaller bus to Nari) or hike up to Seoginbong peak via KBS relay station - both of which we didn't do due to lack of time. Plan the places you want to go to when you get to Ulleungdo and work out the logistics w the info centers. Spend at least 3 to 4 days there to see the various sites and have a good time - it is an island of squids and pumpkins!We travelled to Ulluengdo (arriving into the new Sadong port) from Pohang passenger ferry terminal (3.5 hours ride) and back to Gangneung (3 hours ferry ride) on mainland via Jaedong port. Island buses are not frequent and there is no round island route although they are striving to build a round-the-island road. Roads are windy and narrow at times since it is a volcanic island and certain parts can be steep. Taxi is the other alternative and costs a bit more than mainland. Be forewarned that there is hardly any English spoken on the island but the people are warm and friendly. The tourist info center in Dodong / Jaedong and Sadong ports offer useful maps and information but it will be a challenge to communicate. As such, use sign language, maps and translation apps (Naver) to get the info that you want. Bus schedule is season specific which you can obtain from the info centers. Don't forget to get a Korean map of Ulleungdo as it shows more places of interest and has the names in Korean for which you can map to on the English map!"
봉래폭포,14건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경상북도 울릉 울릉읍,4위(9곳의 울릉 소재 관광지 중),"Bongnae Falls on Ulleungdo are on the list for places to see on the island. It is a nice departure from the coastal road, but be prepared for a short hike up the mountain. The trail is well maintained and passes through some old growth juniper trees. There is a small restaurant area and restrooms along the way up the mountain. Once you get to the top, the observation deck allows for great views of the falls, and back towards to the ocean behind you. There was even a small stand taking and printing photos if you didn't bring your tripod. The cost was 2000 won per person and the total hike took about 1.5 hours with two small children. Worth a visit if you've managed to find your way to the island in the first place!The stroll up to the falls is through a redwood like forrest with tall beautiful trees. There is an interesting spot to cool down that has a ""cave"" that is supposedly a naturally cooling thing.However, it is surrounded by artificial rocks and honestly felt like an air con in there. The falls them self are nice, but there was construction just below the falls when I was there. To me, the man made structures take from the natural beauty of the falls. If you like falls or have time to spare its worth a look thoughThere are other nicer falls. Skip if you don't have time. If you want to go, there is a bus from Dodongri, passing Jeodongri on the way. The bus is not regular. The schedules are posted on bus stop stands. The Seoul T-money cards here (\1400). Otherwise, the fare is \1500. Journey is abt 15 mins, entrance to the falls is \2000. At the last bus stop, you have to walk another 10 mins up a gentle dirt track to the falls. If you are staying in Jeodongri, the 20 to 30-min walk back, mostly downslope on a paved road, is quite pleasant.This is a nice little waterfall tucked away in one of Ulleongdo's many draws. Unfortunately, it is surrounded by some urban sprawl and the old concrete trail is like a big driveway. Fortunately, they have already put in some nice wood stairs and were actively working to improve the area during our visit."
행남해안산책로,10건의<U+00A0>리뷰,경상북도 울릉 울릉읍 도동리,2위(9곳의 울릉 소재 관광지 중),"This was the first activity we did on the island and a great introduction. You can pick this up from either Jeodong or Dodong ferry points and walk to the other. From there it is a cheap taxi ride back the other way or easy enough to hike back! Fresh sushi along the path if you need a snack.From the ferry terminal in Dodong you will find the start of the sea walkway. It runs along edge of the island's volcanic cliff and is right next to the ocean. The view is breathtaking during the day or even at night when you can see the bright squid fishing boats out in the distance.There is a fresh mountain spring along the way where you can stop to get a drink, if you want something more there are numerous pop-up restaurants that serve fresh fish and beer.The pathway ends at the rocky Haengnam beach. You used to be able to carry on along another walkway to the neighbouring town but that is now unfortunately closed.This walk is a great romantic walk for any couple.The path was closed, and the reason seemed to be a degradation of the walkway. The views from the trail head were fantastic, however. I would still have made the trip out, even if I knew it was closed beforehand."

Not all of the exhibits have an english translation, but the flow of the museum is setup well enough to convey the main points.Im not a big museum guy but if you are looking for information of the history of Dokdo and why Koreans belief it to be Korean territory then you can check it out. Its close to the3 main docks so easy to get too. The gondola lift nearby is worth th trip up for commanding views of the island.Have you ever heard about Dokdo ? If you like a view of the ocean want to see a lot of birds, visit Dokdo. It is called ""the hometown of birds"". Dokdo is an island in the east sea of Korea, far away from the Koreapeninsula. So, you should take a ship if you want to go there. There are many beautiful sea creatures and plants. For example, there are dolphins, seaweed, and other marine life of Korea. however,, the main reason why I recommend this island is that there is a special story about the history between Korea and Japan. Actually, it is located in the middle of the sea between the two . So, the Japanese have argued that the island is their own. There are large amounts of underground resources buried under the sea. Officially, the island has existed as south Korea's territory, and there are so many people who are living and protecting it from the Japanese. Furthermore, Korea has argued that they have a lot of evidence which domenstrates that it belongs to Korea. However, Japan does not acknowledge that, and they want the International Court of Justice to decide. So, If you want to know about the relationship between Korea and Japan, you should go to Dokdo.This is a nicely done little museum covering Korea's historical control and ownership of Dok Island. Just the impressive collection of 18th and 19th Century maps alone makes this a worthwhile stop. Also, the museum's amenities are good and it's location above Dodong City is great. I highly recommend you walk back from visiting this museum although it is a good idea to take a taxi up.It's just rocks guys. I feel so misled. No cliff diving or nothin'. From all the pics and stuff in Seoul, I thought this place would be the bomb. It wasn't.When you get off the ferry in Dodong-ni you start to notice all the people going up the hill with their ""I love Dokdo"" tee-shirts. The island of Dokdo is disputed with Japan and feeling run very high. I must be careful to point out that I make no comment about the merits of either case. however, the raison d'etre of the museum is exactly to put forward Korea's case for Dokdo being theirs. As such, it is a place of almost pilgrimage to nationalistic Koreans. To the rest of us, it is a fascinating window on their world view. The presentation is faultless and the general facilities excellent. Ideally combine this with a trip up in the cable car to try (and fail) to see Dokdo through big binoculars from the top of the mountain. There is a nice cafe up there as well."

It was a little complicated for us westerner who didn't know the system, but we had an enjoyable visit. There are 3 different inside pools and 3 smaller outside soaking areas, plus a waterfall area outside. The water is not heated and in June it was warm but not really hot. The wooden outdoor tub was very relaxing. Two of the indoor pools had multiple water jets for massaging different areas of the body and they worked well. They also had 2 saunas inside - one dry and one wet. They were nice and hot and very enjoyable. One of the pools was for little kids, but it only had 1 small slide. No mistaking this for a water park ;)As I mentioned the system was a little complicated. You have to buy tickets at an outdoor ticket booth. Then you go inside and show your ticket to be admitted. Then you take off your shoes and place them in a free locker. Then you go to a counter with your ticket and they give you a key to a free locker in the changing area. They also rent bathing caps, which are required. They keep your shoe locker key and you pay for the caps (and probably food/drinks but we didn't buy any) when you return the changing room locker key at the end.You must shower before entering the spa area from the locker room. The locker room was very nice, spacious and they have a bathing suit spinner which works well and leaves your suit only damp instead of dripping wet at the end.In addition to the main spa area, there is also a more traditional Korean indoor spa where you go naked. There are segregated areas for each sex and this is the only area that was open after 7pm on the weeknight that we visited. Not many westerners choose to try this and we were no exception. Overall, we had a nice time and thought it was worth the visit.Rooms have been renovated and very comfortable. Staff is very friendly and  accommodating. Breakfast at the restaurant is OK.In stressed out South Korea, everyone needs to get away from it all once in a while! Deokgu Spa World and the attached/interconnected Hotel Doekgu Oncheon (Hot Spring complex) is the ticket .. .if you're willing to drive around 4 to 5 hours from Seoul to the far eastern coast. The hotel is a bit old-fashioned and hokey (reminds me of the Budapest Hotel movie), but decent and even serves a Western style breakfast. The SpaWorld though makes up for it with over a dozen types of in-water massage therapies - strong water jets geared to massage sore necks, arms, legs, backs, you name it. They've got your body covered. You can also retreat to the indoor hot baths for some soaking (up to 43 C! as well as cold ""jade stone"" water), stand under gushing waterfalls, venture outdoors for a soak, and so on. I'd recommend at least an overnighter to get the full effect. The hotel has an ""E-Mart"" where you can stock up on provisions, and there's a nice hiking option up the valley from where the water comes from. The area is a secluded valley way over by the ocean, a long slog from Seoul but a lot closer from Daegu."

주왕산 국립공원,34건의<U+00A0>리뷰,"경상북도 청송 333-1, Sangeui-ri, Budong-myeon (우) 763-833",1위(16곳의 청송 소재 관광지 중),"We went to the top of mountain, took about 2 hours. It’s quite tough to climb many steps on the way up. Alternatively you can take a route to the fall/valley the trail is wide and gentle, not stiff. Need to pay entrance fee for the mountain.I think getting here was a little difficult but public transportation and it’s still a long drive to get there but the scenery paid off. The temple was blah (I have seen many temples). and the fee to enter was 3,500w but the park itself was clean so I guess the fee was ok for that. The natural beauty is amazing and the trek to the main attractions are relatively flat that it’s possible to wear sandals, but I wouldn’t recommend it. I was by myself so I moved faster so my entire trip there was about 2 hours but it’ll take most people probably closer to 3 and a half hours round trip. It’s hard to capture the beauty of this park with a photo but I can recommend it.I went here with my parents and both grandmas to see the autumn leaves. On the first day, it was foggy and misty so we couldn't actually go to the mountain. However, there are many places to enjoy the hot spring so it was also a very good experience. The next day, when the weather became perfect, we cold finally head to the mountain and the lake. Such a perfect beautiful place to spend time with families. I could see lots of families and children. It was a quite easy trail to walk even for the old people. I believe this place is always beautiful for the whole year.it's really beautiful mountain that has 3 famous waterfalls. you can walk along the valley easily even if you don't like tracking. especailly you'll get this beautiful scenery in fall. the autumn color is really really good!It is small but such a lovely place to visit. Enterance fee was 2800 KRW per adults and also need to pay for the parking but worth it. Easy 30~40 min stride through mountain. I even wore thongs but no problem at all. For hikers wanting to climb through the top might need to wear somthing more than that.The rocks and streams through the narrow gorge was quite a scene but through the autumn it is crawded with people. Temple at the enterance is reason we pay 2800KRW but it is worthless building from modern days. Lovely short walk but not quite sure we would drive 2 or more hours to see such.It's smallest national park in Korea, but also less crowded. You can get a feeling being alone with nature. I've been to many parks in Korea, this one is stunning walk between cliffs is amazing, easy. There are couple of caves - small detour from main road, waterfalls are one of the most beautiful in Korea.From Daegu Intercity Bus terminal (which is 5 minutes walk away from Dongdaegu Express terminal) there is direct bus 7.30 am and 13.30 am to Juwangsan. If not, then take bus to CheongSong (goes every hour). Then take local bus - goes every 20 mins or so to the park. To go back - use the same, or there are buses to Andong , Seoul straight from park HQs couple of times per day. They pass through CheongSong though. Buy ticket at HQsWaterfalls are easy accessible. Flat walk, just takes 40 mins or so to the first one. I was with my mom, who is in 50th, although it was June, it was quite chilling there +20 or so. Allow enough time to go back to make it for a bus. They leave sharpThis fairly small NP is well worth the journey to visit, especially with the spectacular Autumn colours, but I suspect at any time of year it will be a lovely place to walk. There are a variety of routes to explore, some quieter than others. We did the circuit to the peak of Juwangsan, down to Hurimegi and back along the main valley to the temple. The views from the ridge going up of the limestone pinnacles are awesome and the path was very quiet. The path form the Hurimegi junction to the main valley was beautiful and different again, with a nice woodland feel next to the stream. The main valley was much busier and I think the vast majority of the coach tours just do this section to the waterfalls and back. We saw many people in wheelchairs which gives you an idea of how accessiblle the path is for everyone. The walk over the top is not difficult either and is worth the effort.Beautiful place nice for hiking and camping , nice view of nature.. me & my husband planning to go back there in Autumn..When we arrived early in the day at the tourist center we wondered if it was open. There was snow in the parking lot and not much activity. We decided to see if it was open and inside there was a small store to buy snacks and some tourist items. Upstairs there was a manned visitor center with photos and maps of the park. We were told that the walk to the waterfalls would take three hours round trip if we went to all three, but the first one could be reached in an hour. We decided to take the walk and were amazed all the way with not only the natural beauty, but the way the area is made accessible with boardwalked walkways. We were some of the first in that cold morning, but was we walked many other nature lovers passed by. On the way out we stopped at one of the eateries lining the entry path and had bibimbap and kimchi soup with lots of banchan. The photos can only start to describe the natural beauty. I had some idea about this park from the movie ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"". The lake Jusanji in winter was not available, but the mountains more than made up for it.The fall was such a fabulous time to go to this park. The water was almost done flowing, but there was still water enough for the waterfalls and the leaves were beautiful colors all around us. We took a nice walking path that wasn't so much a hike, but a nice jaunt into the forest. Good for all."

The market branches off many times from the main strip.Pohang a MUST visit place would be the Jukdo Market,it is the biggest market I have been visit in Korea. The dried market selling all sorts of dried seafood and seaweed, as well as fruits and etc. The wet market is obviously all the famous fishes and snow crabs where you can ordered on spot and have a meal inside their restaurant. Snow crab - They normally sell based on min 2person which cost between KRW 60000-KRW120000 per kg. Depends on which stall you visit, and that exclude that you need to pay for table seating fees at around KRW4000 per person that comes with all the bancan exclude rice. If you are a seafood lover you must definitely not give it a missed to taste it. The crab meat is taste sweet and they actually just cooked with seawater so you can actually taste the freshness. For non seafood lovers, you can also walk outside the seafood market and you will see some BBQ restaurants and pub selling both Korean and western food there.If you're new to the city or visiting, it's the best place to go for all things seafood;decent bag of mussels for 5,000won when in season, king crab, raw fish and many other squiggly sea creatures! There's also side dishes, a noodle corner and a lot of fresh produce available - much fresher and cheaper than supermarkets. Also make sure to check out the non-food section. Get yourself some daily hanbok, fabric, hardware etc.Was in Pohang for work. Jukdo Market and Bukbu Beach are not far from each other. Plenty to do in the area. The people are friendly, prices are reasonable, it is a most enjoyable place to visit! Would recommend to anyone traveling around South Korea.It is the largest fish market in Pohang. Food's price is reasonable and Merchants are kind. so it's a good place to visit.For fresh fishs it is the best place to tast. Especially you can buy and eat a dish of sashimi with less than 30 dollar.The market is a fascinating place. There is a great variety of stuff to be found, and the different sea creatures displayed is very interesting. If you wish to eat seafood, you can pick your creature and then eat it in the restaurant right behind or next to the vendor. If you are the re e at the right time you can see them bring it in from the boat.The place is huge.There are so many types of products, e.g. clothes, house utensils, flowers, simple snacks. It is a good place to find many cheap things too, I guess.Definitely worth a visit if you'd like an R-rated version of Finding Nemo. Asian markets are always a ""treat"" for all your senses. Still wondering why the enormous octopuses couldn't be bothered with escaping/leaping from their small water tanks. Definitely try the crab in one of the many restaurants behind the counters (extremely fresh, tasty and cheap).you can eat at restaurants behind the crab market, they will cook the crabs you pick out. You eat sitting on the floor. I was with someone who could speak Korean, so you may need google translate to help, but it was an awesome authentic Korean experience"

The toilet was provided well and many stalls so you don't have to worry about that. Although, the entrances/exits was not big enough, so expect a slow-bottlenecked exit after the show. However, I'm pretty impressed with the seating arrangement, even you get the side tribune, you'll get a good view of the stage!>>> roughly 30 min from Ssangchon station walking and 1o min by car.>>> songam74 bus/cheomdan20 busHuge Outdoor stadium hosted the 2002 FIFA WORLD CUP. has the capacity of for 40,245 seats.really huge venue but due to the seats being really up high, itn gets cold at night, so be sure to grab a jacket with you!Next to a Lotte Outlet mall.. nothing much to see except u know that worldcup was here. Went here by taxi as quite far from the downtown or city centerI went with my son, now an adult (so doesn't fit with trip advisor categories) to see Gwangju FC loose 2 - 1 to Seoul FC. It's a great stadium. I hope that Gwangju can improve and get more supporters as it must have a 30,000 capacity. If it's sunny there is shade for one side of the stadium and the other you just get sun blasted. It's tempting to review the teams, I'd say that the game would be like the English first division level (two levels down from Premiership) but the stadium itself is worth a visit for an event.There are burger , doughnut stalls etc to get food and drink, all reasonable priced. Plus a large department shop right next door.It has a near Lotte Mart and a large indoor swimming pool.It is where various events are frequently held.The opening and closing ceremonies are held here in the last Universiade.Gwangju World Cup stadium is about 25 mins away from Downtown Gwangju. It is easily accessible by bus and taxi, and there are a wealth of motels, hotels and shops near by. The stadium is aesthetically pleasing and has held its design well. There are actually plenty of food outlets nearby, and Lotte has a huge department store right next to it. I last visited here in 2013.Went here to see the Universiade Athletics in 2015. The stadium looks great and getting around inside is easy. Viewing of the pitch is excellent almost regardless of where you sit. It could be easier to get to though, we took the number 6 or 74 bus to get us there every day. Busses are 1200 won a ride and generally quite easy once you know where you are going. Sadly not much in the way of food nearby.Great location to do some shopping, hit the driving range and other sports. Had some great Asian food in the lotte mall and enjoyed the architecture of the stadium.It's interesting to look at, but I've not seen a game here yet. The Lotte Outlets are right here, though so if you're already in the neighborhood shopping, pop outside and take a look. Or go see a game here.I've never made it to a football match here, but there's a large complex surrounding the stadium I visit frequently. There's a large mall next door, a gym (with skating rink!), and a park to walk around. The mall is standard; nothing special unless you live close by, and you need to go grocery shopping. The skating rink is nice, and although the park isn't the prettiest, if you're just looking for an area to walk around, it's nice."
예술의 거리,17건의<U+00A0>리뷰,"광주 Gung-dong,Dong-gu",3위(4곳의 광주 소재 쇼핑 중),"Went there on a weekend and shop owners tried to attracted people with some minor street art. The roat itself should be usually car free and you can walk easily. However we were not exited at all and we left after short time. Juniors were bored ......Yes there is a street. Yes, there are a handful of shops selling traditional ink brushes and other implements. There are even a few art galleries with either traditional painting or modernistic works on display. More eye-catching perhaps are shops that appear to be random collections of junk.Then there's a row of sculpture that frankly is rather blah.In between these shops are coffee bars and shuttered shops.All in all, don't bother unless you're determined to buy something.Is a street with little shops and art galleries. Perfect to walk on a sunny Saturday. A good place for the kids to paint and do some art work.Visited, nothing was going on, a few arty kind of shops but a lot of dead space. Other people wandering around seemed equally unimpressed.Looks like a failed venture from my experience.A short distance from the Asia Cultural Centre lies a giant web of shopping and food. An underground shopping bazaar, while on street level more shopping, cafes, restaurants and street food, nor forgetting money changer counters when you need them. Somewhere here there is also a cat cafe for those who like cats. Street art is also there in some of the streets. If your legs are weak, or you are not into shopping, this may not be your cup of tea. One oddity is across the fountain near the National Asian Cultural Ctr.. Trees whose trunk and branches are wrapped in wool knitting.Nearest subway line is Geunmanro4-ga StationIf you happen to pass through this street, it's ok, but don't take a detour for it. Maybe we got unlucky, but on a Sunday most stores were closed (or maybe they actually closed down?) and there was nothing going on. Better do your shopping in Insadong, Seoul.Did not know what to expect when we visit this spot. But it turned out to be cute. Very close to the shops area. The place has several cute cafe to sit back and relax. It is not as bad as other review really. Although this place has several english classes, communicating can still be very very VERY challenging. Expect the same for any spot around Gwangju.Because I live in Seoul I always compare other cities to Seoul.Gwangju is not a tour site, and there are only a few memorial, or historical monument, so I don~t think It's a good idea to visit Gwangju.If you are travelling Jeunlado, then just visit Haenam,Jeonju, Damyang , Suncheon and Yusoo.If you like trekking, Jili Mount will be good.That's all.Looked at previous reviews and was a bit wary of checking it out, but it was close to the downtown core so we went anyways. Found lots of shops there, but they all sold pretty much the same goods. It was the friendly shop owners who really made it fun. Try and communicate in a language other than your own and it seems they throw discounts at you. The trick is to smile!While my friends and I walked down it all we saw were art schools. A bit of graffiti but not too much other than that. We thought there would be arts and crafts for sale, art galleries and the like (well, one school had a viewing area) but there wasn't much."
국립아시아문화전당,30건의<U+00A0>리뷰,광주 동구 문화전당로 38 (우) 61485,3위(59곳의 광주 소재 관광지 중),"This theatre complex is a state of the art facility that has played a huge part in revitalising the city. Most of it is located underground but the campus is huge with numerous locations both indoors and outdoors for galleries, exhibitions, concerts and theatre. Excellent facility and beautifully finished inside. It was a real pleasure to attend a concert of the Asian Traditional Orchestra there and tour the various exhibitions and events taking place.We had horrible luck with the weather when we visited Gwangju. It was raining hard both days we were visiting. We had plans to do things outdoors, but had to change them. We were traveling with our 5 year old son and didn’t want to walk around too much in the rain. I saw that the Asia Culture Center had a large section for kids so we decided to check it out. It is conveniently located on the metro line at the Culture Complex stop. The Culture Center is closed on Mondays and Holidays. It is open from 10:00 to 18:00 or 19:00 depending on the day. There is a park and play area on the roof of the children’s building. We weren’t able to use the playground since it was raining so hard, but on a nice day it would be great. On the lower level there is a small free play area for kids. You have to get a ticket for about an hour of play, but it’s all for free. A much larger section had an admission fee of 10,000W. You will also need a ticket for the section. The tickets all have a designated entrance time. They won’t let you in a minute early, but you can stay as long as you like. Our son loved the large foam building blocks in this section. We spent hours there building a house out of the blocks. There are also craft and culture activities that kids can participate in. We didn’t sign up for any, but it was good to know that this was available if we wanted to do something extra. There is a cafe located in the building, but I think that it’s only open on the weekends. We were there during the weekday and it wasn’t open. There is also a children’s library that has a large selection of books. I didn’t see any in English, but I assume that there probably are some English books. Overall, it’s a nice and clean facility. I highly recommend a visit if you are traveling with young children.We ended spending almost all day here after only planning a couple of hours. Our 3 year old loved it and there were even fun things for our 11 month old. Kids playground on the roof, free kids cafe in the building (get a ticket in advance) and 3,000krw children’s activity/exploration/museum area inside. Our boy was a bit too small for many of these things (need to be 5 years old and/or 100cm) but there was still a lot for him to do. What an amazing place!Great space to see music and cultural shows. Stayed in Gwangju for the Closing Ceremonies of the FINA Aquatic World Championships in August. Excellent seating, view of stage and protected square. I was very impressed.Interesting architecture - nice public space and some great photo opportunities. Worth seeing.I visited the Asian Culture Center today in Gwang-ju, s. Korea. This huge complex of big building is brand new and modern looking. The library housed books, computers and displays of Asian culture. The ACC creation center was still unfinished inside, and had few displays. The ACC Theatre has a live band playing beautiful music. It was a brief walk upstairs to the May 18th, 1980 Democracy Plaza, the birthplace of this democratic city of “Lights”. At some point, this should be an awesome place to visit!This facility embraces many of the ideas of what a museum, gallery and cultural center should be like in the future. It contains libraries, archives, teaching rooms, creative areas for children and hosts many ongoing events an exhibits. Research ahead of time because there is too much to take in during one visit. In late August I saw the World Music Festival with numerous acts in several outdoor listening areas. Architecturally very fascinating. Easy to get to via Metro subway, just get off at stop 104.Visited the archive and library as well as Gwangju Biennale. Lots to see and definitely worth more than a day's visit.The ACC has many events during the year and the facilities are all new and nice. Definitely worth poking around if you are DT and the weather is nice. Not much to do unless there is an event taking place, but it does have a stage theatre where many high quality productions take place during the year. Check out their website for events.Asia Culture Center is the must-see place in Gwangju. They have a good quality of performances and exhibitions with low cost, even with no money. The architecture itself is impressive and big enough to take your heart. One of my favorite place in ACC is Library Park. They collected videos, books, pictures about Asian culture and produced about ten spots with specific topics such as 'electronic shopping mall in Asia', 'History of performance in Asia'. They have many books and materials in English and other languages, so people who cannot speak Korean can also enjoy this place. Library Park is a free space, so feel free to use at any time. ACC is near to the downtown-Chungjangro, and the hipsters' place, Dongmyeongro-, so it is nice to use your free time."

Well arranged. Good for study the history of korea life style. All the display have both of English and korea to explain.For non-Koreans visiting Gwangju, this museum is a great introduction to the history and culture of Korea, specifically the Jeolla region. The exhibits are nicely done and the English translations here are easy to understand; in fact, the English explanations are some of the best we came across in this area. The exhibit on the history of Gwangju and the special exhibit did not have English translations, which would have been interesting to be able to read, but English speakers will find the majority of the museum informative. I believe there is normally a nominal admission fee, but we paid no admission, probably because of the Chuseok holidays. If you are visiting or new to this area of South Korea, you will find the trip here to be a rewarding time spent during your stay.Nice way to spend a day in Gwangju. The museum is not too large, it should only take an hour or 2 to get through. Pretty informative about the traditional local way of life. They have good dioramas which give you a good sense of the time. I think it was free to visit, or just a small token fee. Usually there are volunteer guides who speak English, so you can have a free guided tour. Outside of the museum, you are on the Biennale grounds, so there is a nice park to walk around, there is the art museum, a small amusement park, and there are usually some events happening in the area. You can easily spend an afternoon here.As it is free, it is a good place to spend a hot korean summer afternoon. However it looks virtually the same as all other folkvillage museums. Korean histeriography is characterized by a strong nationalist underflow and these kinds of museums are one of that underflow's results. Also little explanation in english.Our visit to this museum gave us a unique glimpse into ancient Korean culture. It has beautiful displays and only take about1 hour to see.This was a really interesting find. Well written up and displayed. I learned a lot about old style life here. History and culture well shown.A place to visit to learn Korean history, culture, food and to understand the population. You can ask for a local guide for free.We took a cab from our hotel (Firenze Hotel) and the cost was about 5000 won. The museum is well-organized and most of the information is available in English. The museum traces the customs of Korea from birth to death. I especially enjoyed the displays of local food since it helped me to identify some of the things we had been eating. The museum takes 1 - 2 hours to visit and is free. It's next to the Art Museum and you can also walk to the Gwangju National Museum from the Folk museum (ask for directions). It's about a ten minute walk. We visited both museums in the morning.interesting archive and installations which documenting and resembling the customs and traditions of Korea, in particular Gwangju."

It has a zoo that has all kinds of Animals from the smallest to the biggest and greatest in the animal kingdom.I love it and enjoyed every bit of the excitement. Highly recommended.April 20, 2018, Sunny day. No entrance fee for the Zoo. A fee of 2,000KW per person for the 'Train' ride towards zoo. Benches under trees where you'll enjoy listening to the birds and watching them so do not let the birds' propensity of welcoming you with their droppings ruin your day. In Philippines, you can buy ice cream made out of crocodile eggs. This was one of the attractions aside from the animals. There are also American Movies that have Korean subtitles. The rides that are mentioned in other reviews are still in operation which is also the same in U.K. where the zoo, garden and amusement rides are in one place. My friend calls it 'Themed Parks'. There are stores inside and outside the park. Prices are reasonable. The place makes it very memorable if it is shared with the person you love.I would not go out of my way to visit here. But, if you are living in the area, then it's a nice way to spend a day. Admission is pretty cheap. There are a few amusement park rides and restaurants. The zoo has a good assortment of animals, although their living conditions are less than adequate. When I visited, they were building a farris wheel and a few new animal buildings. It seems like they are investing money in the place, so hopefully it will continue to improve.Is an old amusement park. The zoo part is really in bad shape and you can feel really sorry about the animals. However, the amusement park is good to feel the adrenaline, in part because of the ride, and because the old of the ride, you will never know if is your last ride.This place is okay; the rides are fairly fun (it was my first time riding the Viking pirate ship...and I rode it thrice!), but they're nothing more than your typical fair rides. There aren't really that many options for food other than typical carnival fare, and the theming was just okay; some of it even seemed random (for example, Olaf from Frozen is in the middle of the park). Family Land is not anything stellar, for sure, but it does have a really high slide that's probably the most popular thing in the park. Don't go out of your way, but it's not a bad way to spend an afternoon, either.A mediocre park, with little to do. We only experienced the zoo, and a bit of shopping. The overall trip took us no more than 3 hours, for a price of 5,000 WON ($5 USD) between two people. So really, absolutely no complaints.I do agree with the last review, the cages did seem small and some of the areas did not seem well kept. They should definitely take better care of their animals habitats. If your looking to do something on a sunny day, on a low budget, it is definitely worth a go to check it out. The rides did seem expensive, but I have no experience with this as I did not go on them myself.Well this was a major disappointment. It starts nice with a good walk, beautiful trees and you can even due some hiking if you want. There is also a little train going, but by foot it takes 10 minutes.The amusement park is so old and the attractions are not more than you would find in a fair in 1970.There was even a dancing performance from foreigners dressed in outfits, lets say not very suitable for kids. And it was costly, you pay an entrance fee, but you also have to pay for every attraction.Also for the zoo is a separate fee, it is called Uchi Park, but is right next to amusement park. The zoo was shameless! these poor animals locked up in such tiny, unsuitable cages and places. No facilities for them, even the water was gone for the penguins, polar bears, flamingos and crocodiles. The turtles were drowning because only 1 could sit on a tiny rock and the rest had to keep on swimming, but clearly wanted it to go out. Don't even get me started on the wild dogs and birds! Shame on you Korea! Then the botanical garden, well there are two tiny greenhouses, that is it. And in there is only Rosemary, some cactuses and Mint, that is it? Luckily you do not have to pay extra also for the ""botanical gardens"" Overall this gets a 0 and is a waste of any Kwon you will spent on this. only the trees in and around the park are nice."

The museum was national facility, so free for enjoying. There had many and various exhibits, and beautiful buildings. The exhibits was similar with another national museum, but there had unique atmosphere. Good to enjoy about Korean history.Ahh the National Museums of Korea - most cities have one - and if you've been to one of these before you know the drill: you're here for the pottery, celadon, stone daggers, funeral urns and bronzework. Having been to several National Museums in Korean cities, Gwangju ranks near the top. Very interesting special display of items recovered from a Chinese ship that was wrecked on course to Japan in the early Joseon dynasty. There is also information available on Mahan, which I had not found in other museums.The grounds and building itself are superb! A pleasant place to wander on a hot afternoon. The friendly groundskeepers shared pomegranates with us :DLike most museums in Korea, the museum offers the similar range of display with specificity on Jeollanamdo. Starting from pre historic era, agriculture, Buddhism display, ceramics and the Sinan shipwreck display. Some are without the English explanation but most of them comes with it. The lion light pagoda is at the centre of the museum and well display. It is one of my favourite item from the museum.This place is worth to visit as you will know about korea life in old age. Free entrance well arranged.Not a bad museum. It has a good display of Korean historical artifacts. The staff was really nice and we got some nice stuff at the gift shop.Good art show on that time, some kinds like period exhibitions. the problem i face here, too noisy in this museum which kids and teacher , talking inside the museum , some kind like education . and those kids are running here and there inside the museum. I can`t concentrate good with those noisy.Despite its great building it is actually a small museum which can be visited in less tan an hour. It was reopened in 2009 so it has modern installations and its quite interestingI have visited seven national museums in Korea, including this one. Compared to others, the exhibit is not really extensive and a bit patchy. I have done looking around in just one hour or so. Still worth a visit and other good museums are within walking distance.The Gwangju National Museum has 4 exhibition rooms on 2 floors. Of particular interest is the Buddhist art hall as many of the relics have been found locally. What sets this museum apart though is the staff. We were greeted by exceptionally friendly staff who are clearly passionate about what they do. On the second floor we received a guided tour by one of the curators who was very knowledgeable. All staff we met seemed to be well versed in English as well. It is free to visit the museum."

Sculpture, aesthetic installations (moving pillars!), traditional and contemporary paintings and a special hanji display were all thoroughly absorbing. Also, you can leave your backpacks in the lockers.Stayed there for 2 hours. It has many beautiful paintings to see. It’s a must for any art lover. It’s for free as well.exhibition (Jeong Gwang Hee, 2014) was fair, but the education space within the museum was well planned, which tailors not only the kids but also the adultsI visited the place the place with a Korean friend and listen to the explanation about how old Korean people used to live was awesome to me beacuse I am interested in Korean culture and Art. Advice Art lovers to visit itThe Gwangju National Museum is a great place to visit to learn about the history of Gwangju city. Located at the outshirt of the city it give a very informative historical account of city and also the history of the Korea people going back as far back as the Chinese Tang dynasty. A must visit for first time visitor to the city.Beautiful museum with so much to offer. We came on the opening of Nordic Spirit which is a gorgeous show filled with makettes and an interactive sound piece. The show is curated beautifully. The works on the 2nd floor are absolutely beautiful ( unrelated to Nordic spirit). The flow of this museum is easy with beautiful floor to ceiling pieces.A nice stroll through the park leads you to the Gwangju Museum of Art. There was only one exhibit up, so it was short, but we did enjoy it: the ""Photography and History: Document, Monument, Memory"" exhibit. The exhibit was well done, though very little of it was in English. At 500 won for each adult, it was a nice break.The museum is clean, has storage for backpacks and a large common area where a lot of families with children were lounging and taking a break from the outdoors. (There were a lot of people in the park - Korea's best leisure park)Recommended: If you have time or if you want a leisurely weekend. We went on a Sunday and it wasn’t very busy.The exhibits were pretty cool, but each took literally 15-30 minutes to go through. They seemed as though they changed quite often, so Im sure it would be better if you actually lived in the area and went back every few months. The cafe is also amazing!We actually went during the May 18th ceremony, and were able to watch a video, hear a presentation (in korean), and listen to people sing. Just happened by chance.The area that this museum is in is what made the day for us. The walk around is gorgeous. Not only that but the Gwangju Folk Museum and the Gwangju National Museums is so close that you might as well do all three in one day.Keep in mind that Monday all of these places are closed! Best days to go are Tuesday to Friday.We toured the art museum on a rainy day. It was full of artwork and artifacts to look at. If you're not really into either Korean history or art, then you may want to sit this one out. It is very detailed in everything and for those who do not naturally enjoy art museums, this one is not going to offer anything extraordinary for you. I really enjoyed the time spent here and would go back.The main exibition was classic korean landscape-paintings of hills forests. They were painted in the last 10-20 years by the same artist and they where uninspirering and boring without any creative touch. We went to the child exibition and thus was actually much better. There were some provocative art made by korean artists. Also do not forget to visit the cafe - its very charming with strange, but exciting korean sweets. And you can buy nice art."

There is a monument which contains a small underground museum. The park and monument are free. In addition to the monument, the park is quite nice with walking paths surrounded by trees. It was nice going for a walk after a long international flight and a train ride. There isn’t a metro station close to the park so I recommend either taking a taxi or a bus. Taxis are quite affordable in Gwangju. I suggest spending about an hour at the park. Restaurants and a supermarket are nearby.This is the memorial Ozark for those who lost their lives fighting for democracy and the memorial sculpture in the centre and underground mausoleum are worth seeing. I happened to be there on a hot working day so there were only a few people going for lunch time walks using the circuit path around the park. The underground memorial is impressive. There were no lights on so I just took in the form of it, but then found the light switches, left hand tunnel as you go in, and that helped add to its splendour. At the top of the park is a 3 level pagoda style building and the views from the top of Gwangju were great. This is not a large park so quite accessible for all.This park is an awesome tribute to the people of Korea and their fight for democracy. I have been there several times and feel that it is a must-see destination if you're traveling to gwangju. The staff is friendly and very helpful. The facilities are modern and clean. Go there and check it out.This is a relaxing and beautiful park year round, but especially in the spring once the fountains are on. The 5.18 memorial is moving, and the lawn is a great place for a picnic. You can stop in at the nearby library if you need a book :) You can climb to the top of the hill, or just walk the outer circle and stop by the temple.i have been there 2 times and always felt awesome. The memorial park is amazingly beautiful and clean. It really shows how governments appreciate every souls of people who became victims on May 18th that time. Good place for walk around. There is a museum also in that park. Nice place to learn about historyThis is a great place to while away an afternoon, or just a short hour. The memorial itself is beautiful, peaceful, but still eerily tragic. Make sure you enter the main memorial and go down the steps to the underground part, where all the names are listed. The park is also a lovely place to have a picnic or spend an afternoon. There are plenty of cafes and shops on the streets close by to pick up some lunch too. This is an important place to remember the those who died not long ago, fighting for democracy in South Korea.It is a historic place in terms of Development for the Democracy of Korea. You can feel the voices of Gwangju citizens and their sacrifice for the country.For those interested in history this is an interesting place to visit. It serves as a monument to those who fell in the fight for democracy. It is a monument and graveyard for heroes. We visited the site in November, thus making it also a nice time to also enjoy and take pictures of the autumn colors.This place is an old military base given to the people and turned into a memorial. Freedom is never free and the blood of the innocent is often spilled in order to obtain it.Great spot for a quick walk through or to linger and spend some time picnicking. There are a lot of statues and memorials commemorating the uprising that is credited as the birth of Korean democracy. The memorials are beautiful and moving and the park itself is very clean and comfortable. The day we went there were a lot of families enjoying a picnic in the park."

Just like most subway systems in Korea, it is an absolute joy to use them.Great and convenient! Not expensive if u have T money card of course. Links very well all the city areaThe Metro is a great way to get around, but much of the town is not covered by it.

However Pal Gong Mt is further from downtown or core of the city than Apsahn. Therefore Daegu townscape can be seen better at the Apsahn Observatory than many peaks of Pal Gong Mt. People can either use a cable car or walk to the Observatory. If people would intend to walk to the Observatory they could get off a bus or park their car near the Ahn Ji-Rang Gol Exercise Park. Then they can climb the mountain following the trail via the Ahn Il Sah Buddhist Temple. Even at night they can do thanks to many street lights along the trail until the Observatory. It takes 1~2 hours from the start line to the original position via the Observatory as a halfway point.The view of Daegu on the observatory was worth it! We decided to hike instead of riding a cable car. A bottle of water should come in handy. But there is also a vending machine and a restroom at the middle of the trail near the temple. You can also see a variety of woodpeckers and tits. Would recommend if you want to clear your mind and keep your body in shape. As beginners, we hiked for around 2.5 to 3 hours back and forth.Awesome place for a hike right in the middle of a city of 3 million people! Super nice trails with hikes for beginners, intermediated, and experts!

The cable car ride had great views (better than 남산 in 서울 in my opinion). There's a little cafe after the cable car, my friend got ice cream and she said it was delicious. The views once you walk to the observatory are absolutely amazing, you can see the whole city and surrounding mountains. Definitely recommend spending a day here!My korean friend helped me to get there (without car it can be difficult) and I'm in love! The way to up is kinda hard and you can sweat like crazy but the view is worth everything! Adorable area while climbing and great spot to take photos.You will need to walk up hill which is rather steep before you reach the cable car station for the ride to the top to have a fantastic view of the city. Not recommended for old folks or people who have walking issues. At the end it's worth the effort.Very nice sunset and night view from the observatory desk. Very cold up there so be reminded to bring along a jacket.I’ve been wanting to check out Apsan mountain and it did NOT disappoint. It’s truly beautiful and there’s two observatories at the top. Not a bad hike.Cable car ride was only average. Big and shared, left every few minutes instead of a constant one. Walking to the cable car is a bit of a distance as well so if you cant walk long distance, get a cab. There was a hiking trail but i went too late so didnt use it. The observatory at the top had a decent view, but i believe hiking up higher would have a nicer view. Restaurant inside serves a small menu, a tad expensive but has a camera view of cable car to show when the next cable car would leave. Above the restaurant had another observation deck.From memory it was about 12000 won for the cable car which you have to wait for and share with up to 20 people.There is only one going up as the other is coming down.You have to wait up to 20 minutes for a car.It takes about 10 minutes each way.At the top there is a cafe and some walks which are not well marked.No English.There is a view."

There are many statues and little sites of interesting tidbits of knowledge. We went in the evening and were able to see a gorgeous view of Daegu. Although at night when it got dark, some parts of the hike trails were not well lit, but so many people were out that I still felt safe.This is a large park with stadium, water park children play ground and etc. No realDistinguishable featuresIt's easy to wander around the park for a long time, as there are numerous paths, some challenging, some gentle. A good place to get some shade from the sun but also enjoy the outdoors.I really like this park. I don't know about winter time, but in summer it's so beautiful with flowers. Good to visit with family as well.I won't lie, we got lost wandering around this big park, some of the paths were very steep. We didn't have a map so didn't know where the nearest tube was and ended up flagging down a taxi to get us home. The biggest issue we found was the lack of signs and information on where we were.Within this park area is an amusement park and the 83 Tower. The park is large and takes time to circumvent. It is near a couple of subway stops."
83 타워,134건의<U+00A0>리뷰,대구 달서구 두류공원로 200 (우) 42666,7위(137곳의 대구 소재 관광지 중),"The 83 Tower is one of many towers in the world only for observation about townscape unlike subsidiary observatory on the top floor in very tall buildings. As long as I know there are such two towers in Korea. Those are Namsan Tower in Seoul and 83 Tower in Daegu. Although there is Yong Doo San Tower in Busan I'm not sure the height and scale are equal to those of them. Because the 83 Tower has cafe and restaurant it's suitable for dating, too.To visit the tower you can take a bus (including the city tour bus) or the subway (but that involves a bit more walking). From the bus you cross the road and climb the steps to the small theme park. Information will tell you where to get the free shuttle bus that takes you to the towers base. The tower is very eighties, looks like 4 or 5 star hotel of the time. You can just pay your fee and do the tower, or explore three or four floors of associated attractions which include several restaurants, shops and an ice skating rink (complete with plastic polar bears). The top floor of the free attractions gives you an open place to walk round, take city photos and eat. There is also a old red London double decker bus (which looks genuine) and a classic car. I didn't do the tower but didn't mind the free attractions.This is a nice way to get an overview of the city. The most unique part of this site are all the restaurant and food options in the complex.top of the 83 Towers gives you a great view in daegu recommend !!! you can enjoy 360° view and enjoy the view of Daegu.Daegu 83 Tower was definitely one of the highlights of my first trip to Daegu. As it has everything I like!Firstly, it has a super cool Trick Eye Museum! I've been to one in Seoul, but the one in Daegu is definitely more thrilling! Secondly, it has a beautiful observatory desk where you can see the whole of Daegu in your palms <3 How wonderful ~ Last, but not least, it has Ashley (aka buffet-style restaurant) And for me, food is everything <3 So my day was filled with lots of cool photos, beautiful view of Daegu and a very delicious food :)P. S: it also has some cool shops & cafes as well as cool installations! So I definitely recommend to check it out when you're in Daegu ;)It was hazy nor cloudy when we went so we were able to get a clear sight of daegu at a glance. There is a cafe up in the observatory as well as several souvenir shops! Worth a visit!Place close to city with interesting view. Not so many interesting things inside but nice artistic installation outside.With minimal crowds, the view is lovely and worth a visit. The theming and lights at night make this as good in the evening as the day. A must when in town.We arrived at night and the way up was fast within 3min, we were up and the view was not spectacular just ok .. within 5 mins we decided to return to our car but waited 20mins for the lift. Do not visitTower is a separate fee. there is nice view from top of mountain, but great view at bottom of tower so why pay extra? Definitely get some bubble tea before you go up though."
이월드,135건의<U+00A0>리뷰,대구 달서구 두류동 산 302-11,8위(137곳의 대구 소재 관광지 중),"Queue was long! On a sat evening so expected. The after 5pm tickets were cheaper but not by much. Alot of family friendly rides, not really for thrill seekers. Only Boomerang was mad, the other coaster were so-so. The food variety here is crazy. The fireworks happened right in front of you, so the view was crazy awesome even though it was a much smaller scale.I think if you have kids they would like this, but fot 2 adults the rides were just ok. Mostly carnival type rides. The boomerang coaster was fun, the others the lines were too long because it was some sort of holiday. We got kind of bored after a couple hours so left. If spending several days in Daegu maybe check out, or if with kids. Otherwise skip it.eWorld is a great night out for all ages. Go after 5pm for a discounted ticket - you’ll have more than enough time to do everything. It closes at 9pm in Summer. It was very quiet and we got on every ride without queuing. Only problem is if you are tall like me. I’m 6’ 3” tall and I was too tall to fit on the “Camelback” rollercoaster l. On the “Hurricane” I was hit on the head by a tree branch but it was more funny than sore. The boomerang was excellent though. The park looks great in the dark with the thousands of bright lights flashing!Biggest amusement park in Daegu. I guess it is bigger than any other in Busan.39000 for adult. It is very expensive to me. But I guess it is better than Lotte World or Everland in terms of waiting line. If you choose a good day, you may enjoy any attraction without waiting here.I didn't go inside but I would if I could get some discount.I and my boyfriend went to this place for our dating. It was wonderful and fun. Even it was crowded but I love it. I went to the theme park in Seoul before but didn’t feel local because lot of visitor are foreigners but I can feel local here ! I’ve tried roller coster and giant swing and I love it so much. I also went to the tower. The view was great and good for a coupleHonestly, we wouldn’t even have visited here if we knew the conditions of the theme park. First of all, there weren’t many visitors to begin with. I have never been to a theme park that looked so quiet and dead. Most of the rides and games were not operating. The weather was cold and it was drizzling a little, only a few food trucks were opened for the visitors but managed by the same one or two staff. The mini zoo was poorly maintained. Rabbits were all hiding in the dirty cage, looking spiritless.Why do I still rate E-World 3/5 stars?We visited the theme park with an intention to catch the cherry blossoms and not so much for the rides. Cherry blossoms indeed made up for everything else since it was full bloom during the festival period at E-World. Secondly, the theme park did look more beautiful at night when the lights were switched on. It was pretty empty but then again, we didn’t have to queue up for any rides that were operating during our visit. (Actually we only went for the viking ride and we were the only persons on the ride haha)Lastly, I wouldn’t recommend to purchase a separate ticket to go up the 83 Tower unless you really want to catch the cityscape of Daegu. Visitors can still hang around outside the tower, which has a similar view as well.I visited your amusement park last weekend.I was disgusted at the condition of your poor rabbits!It was very sad to see. Some of them looks sick, and had damaged body parts and clear signs of illness.If your animals are ill, gor whatever reason, they should not be on public display. They should be It is very sad, I even spoke to a member of your staff. They explained that a lot of them get ill, but they are there for peoples fun and are not well looked after!Your petting animals in the farm were also clearly being bothered by young children, and sadly there was no member of staff to look after their interests.I would suggest, if you do keep animals for econmonic game, you have a responsibility to treat them with respect and keep them in good health. Your young visitors would learn more about respecting animals and your animals would be happier.We went to this park in early afternoon and stayed until about nine. Not even once did we wait in a line except for waiting for the current run of the attraction to finish. There are many exciting attractions, I recommend the 360 spinning one especially. Probably the best amusement park I’ve ever been to, I cannot recommend this enough.E-World was a $5US taxi ride from our hotel. We wen on a weekday, about 6 PM. It was deserted, which was a big bonus for my 9-year-old because he could ride rollercoasters and bumper cars over and over again! Admission was about $20US each, but this does not include access to the Tower. You can take the skycar to the top of the park for free and see the whole park. The park lights up and the only other people you'll see are high-schoolers on date night. We spent about 3 hours there and the were closing the restaurants, so we walked down the block to a restaurant instead.Visited the park after 5 p.m. Entrance fee was only 21000 won per person which is little more expensive if you're entering the park before 5.00p.m. Well maintained park and full of various eye catching decorations. Nice place to go and enjoy with friends or family. So many mind blowing rides such as rollercoaster s, Viking etc. 5 min walk from Duryu station in Daegu subway line 2."

It would be beautiful in Autumn and Spring I think. It was wonderful to see in the rain when it was so lush and green. I spent about two hours wandering around. If you like nature but aren't up for a hike, this is a great place to go to just relax and enjoy fresh air, peace and quiet. It is wheelchair and pram accessible with parking facilities, paved pathways and plenty of wheelchair accessible bathrooms. I used the non-accessible bathrooms and they were clean and well maintained.Since the cherry blossoms only last about a week, we headed to the Daegu Arboretum to appease our visual receptors. With the additions of Tulips, Poppies, and other assorted early-blooming varieties of garden visuals, we were pleasantly surprised. There are beautiful water features throughout, and the parks' pinnacle is a traditional Korean Garden. Plenty of Asian-customary raised picnic ""decks"", so bring a lunch if visiting with a group of friends or family - since we're just a couple, we were able to view most of the park in under 2 hours.You can spend a couple of hours wandering around the place to fill in time.There are various flower beds that need attention.Some glass houses that are just ok.I woudn't recommend going out of you way unless you wanted to fill in time.Free to enter.I happened to be here in early November while the Chrysanthemum Festival was taking place and it was absolutely beautiful! There were many sculptures made from Chrysanthemum flowers, so I highly recommend going there when they are in bloom. It was also fall, so the beautiful orange, yellow, and red leaves were everywhere. It was absolutely breathtaking.It’s been wonderful experience to be here Very friendly people Food is good Enjoyed a lot Hotels in Downtown are goodI visited the place in the beginning of the autumn. The leaves started to change colors already. It was a great time to visit this place. The park offers many paths to visit many different places with lots of different vegetation. There are also few greenhouses where one can see tropical or desert vegetation. There is no entrance fee and the place is great for families.It's reclaimed land and definitely an underrated beauty of a destination. You can take out of town guests there before or after going to Biseulsan for Korean traditional food. It's free but parking can be a beast during peak foliage beauty times.recommended to drive there.Its the first landfill project in the country to be reconstructed as an eco-friendly park. The park is almost a square mile and includes more than 1,000 varieties of trees, wild flowers, cacti, medicinal herbs, bonsai, ponds, fountains and groves of bamboo and fruit trees. There are several trails and grassy areas for picnics from which to enjoy the seasonal changes in the park.Spend a day at the Daegu Arboretum. It's a reclaimed LANDFILL that until recently stored more than 4.1 million tons of garbage. It had been abandoned for 10 years prior to construction. Now the roots of thousands of native trees is working to effectively compost the waste and return this once unusable space into a place where locals can learn about how they can help protect the environment, enjoy a picnic or a cup of coffee as they stroll for one end of the park to the other.I went to the Daegu Arboretum for their annual Fall chrysanthemum festival. It was busy with people, but the flower exhibitions were spectacular! The arboretum itself has lots of lovely paths to stroll around. Nearby there are lots of cafes and resturants. A great day out in you are in Daegu.Nice place to walk around. What's bothering a bit is the music blaring from hidden loudspeakers, because you know Ajeossis on the mountain also bring their speakers everywhere and nature alone is too creepy for Asians."

You can also get great food like fried chicken and sushi. The stadium is small and the fans are loud. Go at least once just to get the feel of it.easily accessable by subway. park is new. no assigned seating. first come first serve in the skybox section. tickets are cheap. a must see!If you enjoy baseball, you will love going to a Samsung Lions game at Daegu's Samsung Lions Park. This stadium is beautiful, with a large parking lot and can be easily reached by mass transit as well.There are cheerleaders that get the crowd involved each time the Lions step up to the plate. We were on our feet more than sitting in our seats, cheering and jumping and having a great time.Sit on the 3rd base side of the field if possible. That is where the cheerleaders ""set up shop.""You can get an affordable seat whether you want to sit near the cheerleaders or along the baseline. There is plenty of food and beer available inside at somewhat reasonable prices depending on what you want. The crowd is super fun, so happy to support the team. There are a song and dance for every player and everyone seems to know the words! Great family outing or just go as a baseball fan.We went to the new stadium by subway. It lets you out in front. Tickets are easily purchased and most seats have a good view. The stadium sells a variety of food and drink choices. You can setup a blanket or opt for a box seat. Prices are reasonable for the whole family.Of the nine pro baseball ballparks in Korea, this one most closely resembles a MLB level ball park. Good sightline from most seats and it's a nicely designed clean park. Good selection of food and drinks compared to most other parks also.I watched my first baseball game here. It was very hot summer evening, and the season was just starting (the stadium was not full), but the feeling was still great. There are many things happening during the game so the audience doesn't get bored. It was a nice experience.Better than old one. All facility is good, but Daegu's hot temp makes everybody crazy!!    It has great sound system and score screen. Easy to know.It's day and night between the old Citizens park in Buk-gu and this new one near Suseong IC in Lions Park.Washrooms are better. Sightlines are better. Food 1000x better. Subway accessible. The atmosphere here is like a US college game but definitely worth checking out as an expat or soldier stationed over here. The only pity is Samsung's terrible record in their new home and no playoffs so far!Baseball games in Samsung Lions Park are always exciting. It is also interesting to see Lions fans cheer for their team. Lot of dancing and chanting! The outside stadium light is read when Lions are losing and blue when they are winning!Transportation is very convenient compared to old baseball stadiums.The subway and bus station are close by Samsung Lions Park and parking facilities are quite large.The baseball stadium is very clean. There are many shops including Burger King, Chicken store and a supermarket on the first floor. So you can pack food and drinks before the baseball game. However, outside bottled drinks cannot be brought in.Furthermore, near the stadium, there is Home Plus, E-Mart and Daegu stadium so you can go for a walk or go shopping. A great place to see baseball and also enjoy the nearby area!"
국립대구박물관,53건의<U+00A0>리뷰,대구 수성구 청호로 321 (우) 42111,17위(137곳의 대구 소재 관광지 중),"This is a small museum with only 3-5 exhibition rooms (one was closed when I was there) but it has some lovely things in it if you are interested in old Korean artifacts. There was also an exhibit on fashion and fabrics which had some great traditional fabrics in it. I was glad I visited, despite its slightly awkward location.It was very quiet at 10.00 on a Saturday.It is a little hard to reach if going by public transport - I got a taxi there (about KW9,000 from fairly central in town) - but to get back to town there are a couple of buses that leave from the station outside of the museum and go to the Children's Park monorail station which is about 10 minute drive away (I cant remember the numbers but it did come up on google maps) which may be the easiest route.Very small museum, no English audio guide, 9k won entry fee, off the center. 

Rather go to the one in Seoul - much bigger, free entry and free English guided tours.The museum is in a former school. It is nice and offers a good overview of the history. It is just a bit away from the metro. There are surely some buses that drop you off nearby, but not the city tour bus for instance.I went here when a relative visited me from America. Like most museums in South Korea, it's very well laid out and welcoming. If anything, I was surprised at how few people were there. (It was a weekday.) It's obviously a lot smaller than the National Museum in Seoul, but there are plenty of interesting old things to see from clothing to jewelry to artwork. There are also a lot of nice souvenirs on sale in the gift shop. I'd plan on spending an hour to 90 minutes here.Free entry. All signage in Korean. Difficult to know where to go once inside but it's not long before you are politely ushered to the correct start point then it's a matter of just going to the next open door. Magnificent history to be read and artefacts to be seen. Not the easiest place to access via public transport, bus only, or you can cab it from Hwanggeum monorail station for a reasonable price. Good to visit on a rainy day.There is a good amount to see, some English translations, but a good depiction of the richness of the Korean history. I visited over the Chuseok holiday and it was packed with families. Chuseok is all about getting the family together and spending time enjoying traditional and cultural Korean things. So being at this museum was one of those chance opportunities to passively observe Korean culture. Pretty cool.If you have time, it's worth visiting. Only takes about an hour. There were hands on exhibits for children that had potential as well.I visited this national museum with one of my Korean colleague. There are lot of things to see but if you are foreigner then you cant understand meaning of anything. So better if you take guide or take some Korean with you. otherwise korea is very cultured & disciplinant country.This museum is great when there are exhibits and the park around it is gorgeous. Perhaps things have changed since I came here but a few more translations would have been helpful.A good museum but not like other museum at akl! Yet, I appreciate the parks outside and at tje back of the museum which has a small trailing stuff. It's good to visit in Chuseok cuz you'll enjoy the free games and free foods."

서문 시장,307건의<U+00A0>리뷰,대구 중구 큰장로26길 45 (우) 41926,5위(137곳의 대구 소재 관광지 중),"A huge open-air market which is colorful and heartwarming in offering a slice of Korean life at its best. Everything is sold here from clothing, household goods, plants to food of all varieties. Especially impressed by the stalls selling rice/porridge with intestines (a rarity in Singapore these days) oden and all types of street food. Stall-holders are hard-working and persuasive, calling out to us to buy fresh fish, mainly mackerel, but many varieties of dried goods as well from ginseng to dried shrimp.A wonderful Sunday morning's visit!This is an awesome market with a wide variety of foods and clothing, as well as other items. The street food is really awesome and very authentic. Definitely a must do while in Daegu.After the Kwangjang Market in Seoul, anything will feel smaller, with fewer choices and fewer people. But the Seomun Market is still a worthy destination to try lots of different dishes and you will never get food this close to the fire. Delicious scallops, BBQ Chicken, Mung Bean Pancakes all prepared and served in minutes. You walk, eat, walk, eat and yo can even duck into one of the stores along the way to pick up a cold beer.I visited there with my boyfriend.It’s easy to go there by subway. It’s a huge place, and they sell almost everything. I had tteokbokki with fried thin dumpling and kimbab. It was total 7,000won. The taste was okay. But I think it’s not original taste. I think they modfied the taste to forigners. I was abit a shamed of it. Anyway, eventhough the place was super crowded, I enjoyed there as much as I can. Oh, if I have change to visit there again, I would like to be there at night.I found this spot randomly while taking a walk to see the area of my hostel. Quite interesting place, lot of good looking food and kins people. Not so many sellers knew english but in the end it was not so big problem.Seomun Market is large and has many shops. Went on a Sunday and most shops were open. Street food and other goods available for sale.Though they have wholesale center here, the retail price of clothes are high and definitely not wholesale pricing. In fact the clothes are more expensive than those like Who.au, uniqlo or small boutiques in junggung ro. Daegu is known for napchang (flat fried dumpling wrap with japchae). Daegu offers more noodle than rice option. A lot of bakery and pharmacy here. The usual food fare like fried chicken , fried pancake in Seoul are not widespread here.There were a lot of people and stalls during the day. Many were closed for the lunar new year. At night there were a lot of food stalls that came out.Great food at the night market and very cheap! It's an easy subway trip in from anywhere in Daegu and worth visiting.Google indicated that the night market is opened everyday. The sign at the market stated so as well. But guess what, we went there at 7:30pm, and the whole market was closed! We were so disappointed."

It's an area of land by a river split down the middle with a roadway. One side of the road are large very attractive landscaped gardens, the other side forests of various types of trees. Along the road centre there are buildings used for exhibitions and plazas, when we were there speed skaters were practising. There is an attractive Expo bridge across the river and the rivers opposite bank features impressive buildings also created for 1993 World Expo.The park is very nice and a wide area. You don't have to pay anything, it's free. There are also some traditional Korean gazebo to relax. This place is also near Daejeon Expo Plaza with its fun fountain for kids to play around in summer.A very nice place, a lot of flowers, i visited at the Fall, so, the colour of the leaves are the best of my visit.I was staying here for a conference. And near Daejeon Conference Center you can find this lovely garden. It is free to visit and offers some great views over the gardens and Daejeon city. A visit is really recommended And it is free!This park is attractive and not too far away from a metro stop. It offers several trails and although it is small, you will end up spending a lot of time wandering around the various trails. There are several different areas of the park and it is great for beautiful pictures as well. It is free to visit.I was there on a June Saturday morning. Lovely and interesting vegetation of many types, very quiet, despite the hundreds of other people (and lots of kids) around. Would be even more beautiful in the spring, and maybe in the fallNot the best gardens I’ve ever been to, However nice peaceful and relaxing. Good place to bring your family, and have a nice picnicI like thus place because the location is close to the downtown (Dunsan area) and expo park. If your hobby is jogging, i believe you will like this placeI live in Daejeon over 20yrs. In my opinion, this is the best place to taking a walk with your families. Nice environment. You can park your car in front of the Nammun Park or art museum etc.There are a lot of Korean plants that are cultivated by gardeners. Perhaps you can take a rest from the city life. I sometimes go to the Hanbat Arboretum after work on Fridays. It has satisfying paths with various plants, so I rest or take a walk there. It has gorgeous views during each of Korea’s four distinct season."
계족산 황톳길,18건의<U+00A0>리뷰,대전 대덕구 산디로 79-70 장동산림욕장 (우) 34345,16위(136곳의 대전 소재 관광지 중),"Took 2 buses from the Yuseong area and then had to wait about 45 minutes at the bus stop for the 74 up the mountain. Had I known that, would have just taken a taxi (for less than 20k Won). Not sure if that is the actual scheduled time or if there wa sa hiccup and some 74s just didn't come... It took us about 2 hrs to get up, and I was already pretty over it. But I am glad we stuck with it - it was worth the difficult ride up. Siunce it was already 2pm when we got there, we just hiked up (with shoes) to the fortress, and came back down barefoot. It was a total of 7k and took almost 2.5 hours with a leisurely picnic at the top. This was the perfect length for us on this day. The fortress has amazing views of the mountain and river and city. I would definitely suggest walking with shoes in the beginning and barefoot on the way back. There are lots of bathrooms and drinking water faucets and spots to wash your feet and shoes. It's free, since a private investor pays for the upkeep. The hike was more strenuous than I expected, but mostly because of the many many steps up to the fortress. But do-able for all ages and levels of fitness.We caught two buses from Daejeon to get here, which was straightforward. The walk itself starts off with beautiful soft squishy mud and you could easily wear bare feet the whole way around, but we detoured up to the 7th Century fort that is in the middle of the loop, so put our shoes back on. With this detour and a generous stop for lunch (and to share food and sochu with locals on the top!) it was a 4-5 hour stroll. There's plentiful toilets and water, and a place to wash and dry your feet at the start/end. There's also food vendors for snacks.A group of 7 of us traveled at least an hour to climb half this mountain, during the fesitval. We went on the day that the marathon was not taking place, so it was not crowded. We were able to leisurely walk, take photos and enjoy the clay and its healing properties. The clay gets sprayed with water periodically to keep it moist and comfortable to walk on. We did not walk on the clay with shoes at all, so we brougt backpacks to hold our shoes, water and snacks. There are vendors selling beverages and snacks, there might have been one restaurant at the start of the clay path. There were a few areas for families: for children to play and do arts and crafts. There is a bathrooms, rinsing station and a few benches to sit and rest along the path. There is also an outdoor theatre where singers, dancers and musicians perform during the festival. There are places to clean your feet at the entrance and exit (same place) of the path. My only complaint is that was we all got lost and it ended up taking a lot longer to arrive. For the festival at least, I wish there was an easier way to get to the mountain. It was a great and rare experience.An enjoyable hike. The cooling sensation from the red mud and it's so therapeutic can go on forever. Worth a visit if you happen to be in Daejeon. Definitely one of my favourite place to visit in Daejeon and will definately come back for a hike.Go to this trail when it's warm so you can truly enjoy the red clay, if at least for a short jaunt. The trail was marked clearly and even the bus ride out was a lovely adventure, being hidden in a valley. Bring some cash to buy fruit from the vendors. Be prepared to get dirty. The entire trail holds lovely different surprises like a train playground for children, various washing stations, the usual outdoor workout equipment, benches, picnic areas, scenic viewing areas and so on. Pleasant and definitely worth the trip."

대전 오-월드,97건의<U+00A0>리뷰,대전 중구 사정공원로 70,3위(136곳의 대전 소재 관광지 중),"We visited around afternoon till closing time 6pm. We only purchased the entrance ticket (without rides) and subsequently purchased a ride on the safari separately when we wanted to see the lions, elephant and zebras only in that session. But we didn’t find it worth but you get to see standing bears trying to wait for rewards from the bus (that drive inside). The ride in that safari bus is about 5-7mins. Too short for the amount we paid. Flowers sections according to the staff during November there’s nothing to see. We took bus there and bus back from hotel nearby bus stop. Not all area are up when we visited. Some area like seal session was closed but not mentioned in the map. There is no English map when we requested for one. Some Xmas decors are up while some Halloween still being taken up when we visited.I was a beautiful day, and the flowers were in bloom. A lot of people, but l was surprised at the number of animals there. We had lunch, which was nothing special, but not horrible either. A great place to take young children on a weekend.Good things first- it's nice for an afternoon with friends- the flower gardens are very pretty- the rides are funBad: and I'm not an expert but these were very obvious things- the Zoo and many animals were in poor condition- many cages were just overpopulated - severly- the monkeys on the picture were in a maybe 10 to 10 meter cage with no climbing possibilities and an obvious skin condition- there were more specially monkeys with skin conditions that didn't seem to be treated- there was a very little monkey baby in desperate need of attention all alone. At that age it should be with a careperson at all times.- many animals had no access to food or water- donkey hoofs were probably never in their life treated and must have pain walkingThis is the only zoo in Daejeon. Far away from heart of the city but frequent 301 bus brings you to there.Don't skip this delightful place if you have a day of beautiful weather and want to be outdoors! The two of us spent 4 hours (or more) exploring Zooland, Flower land, Bird land, the maze, plus two dance shows. We went the day before Chuseok (Thanksgiving); it was not too packed. The first thing we did was the safari, because we had to stand in line. Zooland was filled with so many animals I have never heard of, let alone seen even on Animal Planet. All of the signs were translated in English to read the names of the animals, but much of the animal information was written in Korean. Also, there are several vending machines to purchase food for the animals. Guests are encouraged to feed the camels, deer, bears, monkeys, etc. Very cool. Flower land was the best part to me; the displays and designs were colorful, creative and gorgeous. There are family restaurants there too, but we did not try any. The only thing I wished there was more of were maps translated in English and the payment details at the ticket counter. We didn't ride any rides; they seemed to be for children - but if I return I will ride the carousel. Definitely recommend arriving around 3pm to see the animals and flowers during the day, and see the sunset for the light displays and performances.When in Daejeon, it is NICE to visit O-World Park. This is a combination of botanical garden and Zoo! In addition, the park offers some rides and an entertainment area where free performances (dance and songs) are done! Every season offers a particular activities and sites to enjoyMy 5-year-old son, my closed Korean friend and I enjoyed visiting the zoo at Daejeon O-World. We saw various kinds of wild animals, especially those monkeys tigers and birds. The facilities and safety are good. My son really enjoyed watching these animals. This would be a perfect place for children to learn about wild animals. You wouldn't want to go to the natural history museum to see those stuffed wild animals no more.Don't look for western standard rides at this park, they're more in line with carnival style rides, but my son enjoyed himself all day here. We really liked the zoo portion of the park. They have put forth effort to make some decent enclosures for the larger animals and there is a drive thru safari where the animals have lots of freedom to roam. Large selection of species. New section set to open - Bird World that should be really nice. I didnt get to see the garden portion of the park since my son wasn't interested i n it so I can't comment on it, but the small entrance area i saw looked like they put an intense effort into creating unique topiary and flower designs.Be warned this park is filled with day care and pre-schoolers during the week. It seemed like millions when we were there. They leave as the afternoon goes on and the teenagers come in.One of my favorite places in Daejeon! Of course aside from the letter O, this theme park has a well organized gardens and a zoo on one side. In addition, there are song and dance performances by individuals and groups which are scheduled at a certain time of the day. I love this place!O World is Great!!!If you are in the area, just grab the kids and go. It is not very expensive compared to other amusement parks plus it has other activities for you and the kids that you need to be at the door upon opening.I certainly recommend a day out with the kids at O World."
ㅅㅡㅋㅏㅇㅣㄹㅗㄷㅡ,79건의<U+00A0>리뷰,대전 중구 중교로 83 (우) 34924,6위(136곳의 대전 소재 관광지 중),"Shopping is amazing. Visited a pet store and almost brought two friends home. Food was amazing. Was in town to visit friends and to see the nightlife. This city did not disappoint. Went to a coffee shop, had a discussion over who is better: the Eagles or the Heroes. Korea takes its baseball VERY SERIOUSLY haha. I enjoyed my time here very much. Can't wait to do it again.Feels a bit dirty and smell of sewerage was everywhere. Shops around the area does make it interesting.Breathtaking in the night, when the huge display is turn on. Good for group pictures, marking events, surprises, marriage asking :))During daytime the beautiful ceiling of Skyroad is off, which is utterly disappointing. Hence, during the day it's just another a regular, loud, market street, with music blasting into the allies from the loudspeakers of all the shops. The main attraction -- the gorgeous ceiling -- is only visible in the evening.There is a light show in the weekend, and sometimes there is your face recorded and showed in the LED screen of Skyroad. You can find so many cosmetic stores, food stores, and others. The interesting places that I recommend are:- Sung Sim Dang (성심당) bakery (from 1956) that has authentic fried bread named Soboro (소보로) filled with red bean paste in yellow paper bag and with butter paste in purple paper bag,- Yoogane (유가네) a Korean food restaurant (semi fast food)- Farm's Chicken Buffet beside Yoogane in the 2nd floor, where you can eat fried chicken as many as you can, with 8 flavour (from the sweet to spicy), plus rice and soda for only KRW 7,400 (2019). You can replace soda with beer and add KRW 1,500 only. Cheap and delicious!- the Artbox with many cute things you can find.You can reach this place by getting off the train at Jun-gang-no station in Daejeon.It was a decent shopping area. In the daytime, however, they do not light the ""Skyroad"", the primary reason I decided to visit in the first place. The shopping is decent, though.This is really a shopping experience, peppered by eating opportunities. In fact, from the moment you arrive at Jungangno station on the Metro - leave from Exit 2 - you find yourself in an underground shopping mall, fanning out in three directions from a large seating area around a fountain. Mainly clothes and accessories but also a good clutch of the Korean cosmetic / beauty stores - Etude House, Tony Moly, Innisfree, Olive Young etc.Progressing up to street level and into the warren of streets that feed into the Sky Road you are beset by the sights and smells of fried chicken, street food and shops and restaurants vying for your attention.The previous couple of times we have been in Daejeon, it has been summer and so the streets have been lined with stalls but, in February, things are quieter, which also means that access is easier.The Sky Road itself is, in essence, the spine of the shopping centre with all the other streets branching off it (like ribs I suppose). The shops are pretty standard and there are all the usual cafe outlets. You will probably come across an Ajuma trying to hand you a leaflet or someone attempting to entice you into their shop.If you cross the Sky Road and keep heading towards the river, cross it via either the foot or road bridge, you will come to the market, a much more authentic experience.That said, if retail therapy with frequent refuelling stops is for you, you won’t be disappointed.Nothing spectacular except for the LED screen used as ceiling. Haven't seen anything like it, and having seen it once, wasnt enamored enough with it to do a special trip to visit again. But if you're in Daejeon, and haven't seen anything like it yet, drop by.Just to put things into perspective, Daejeon is not as bustling as Seoul. For those who are familiar with Australia, Daejeon is to Seoul what Canberra is to Sydney.It is a welcome break to see a modern city like Daejeon that has a delicate balance between the usual amenities as well as urban landscape in a modern city with rural pockets. Skyroad is an area to get your retail and food fix given the concentration of small shopfronts boasting a variety of F&B outlets, famous Korean cosmetic brands and other retail concepts. Ideal time to visit is at night where you get a chance to see the huge 200m ceiling TV screen. It has a young vibe and it’s quite obvious given the hoards of teenagers in school uniforms hanging out there after school. You will be able to cover the whole area, including exploring side streets etc in a leisurely 5-6 hoursI went there at noon time and spent 5 hours in that area. A lot of shops and the street is amazing. If you like simple nice places please visit it"

Enjoyed the night walk here.It’s a nice bit of architecture, and to be fair you can see it from almost anywhere in Busan. The Hop On/Off tour bus crosses it twice on its city route but ferry terminal observation deck has best unobstructed view for pics.It was very beautiful at night. It's quite difficult to find because I'm lost. There are many BBQ restaurants and they are good.Nice view from the port or tower, Gamcheon village. It is a real lamndmark of Busan. Nice view as well from the terrace of the Lotte mall in the sea port.If you're afraid of heights stay away but the views are fantastic. There is a toll charge but a few $. It's worth the view of the city.This double deck bridge can get busy at rush hour but it is very nice to visit over night time. Great piece of engineering.Didn’t anticipate the uniqueness this site offers. Went down to beach for dinner and a walk and was happily surprised by the light show on the bridge. A must-do. Don’t miss it.I have visited gwangandaegyo bridge in three ways: view of Gwangwalli beach, walked over the bridge during an event and from a ferry ride, and it has mesmerized me in all the ways. definitely must watch at night or a foggy morning. This is also the host of Busan Fire Festival which again makes it a must visit."

장산,35건의<U+00A0>리뷰,부산,52위(244곳의 부산 소재 관광지 중),"We had a chance to go to Busan and Seoul, South Korea on 20th-27th April 2019. We decided to go to Busan for 3 days 2 night. We did a lot of outdoor recreation activities there e.g. cruising and hiking but the one of outdoor activities that we recommend you to do when you arrived at Busan is hiking. This activity is very popular for Korean people and foreigners because it was not too difficult to do and we didn’t have to prepare a lot of specific stuffs for hiking, we can wear only normal sneaker and proper attire for hiking. We did hiking at Jangsan Mountain where is the park surrounded by the forest, waterfall, and the natural scenic view. You can also see the Busan city view when you go almost to the top of the mountain. There is tourist information office, public map, insecticide spray service, sand dryer and public bathroom provided. During we walked to the top, we saw the caution of wildlife in the forest and you should not disturb them. You will get new Korean friends while you are hiking because Korean people are very kind and friendly. They will say hi to you all the way, they also look happy and enjoy with hiking. When you come back at the start point and feel so tired, there are a lot of local foods and drinks sell there and also have the area for take a rest. This activity is very recommended because it’s easy to go by public transportation and a lot of facilities provided. It’s not dangerous activity. The important thing is everyone should follow the rules and policy of the attraction respect of local people for making your activities goes well. We would like to recommend that the attraction should have the local guide who can speak English stand by there for facilitating foreigner tourists and should have a first aid service at the attraction if there is any accident.This is my first time to went to South Korea. I went to Busan and went to Jangsan mountain for hiking. It's like the most adventure activity that I had done. At first I took Metro to Jangsan station and walk to exit 10 then I walked from the station to the start point of the mountain but I didn't walk alone I came with my friends. For the start point It has the spray for every hikers to protect the insect then we chosen the way to hike they separate into 3 way by levels which are yellow line, blue line and green line at the first we decided to go to the easier than the least but when we hiked for a while we got lost along the way because the sign is the Korean language we don't understand. It's too difficult to find the right way but it has a few of English sign so we used the translation in the application to help and we asked for the Korean hikers to help us. They tried to communicate and help us as well as they can then they brought us to the top that is the helicopter park so along the way wasn't easy to hike but everyone try the best to go to the top. All of us already pushed our limits to this hike and we really appropriate to the kindness of the Korean hikers. It was fun and good experience for hiking this time. Next time I hope to be there and go to the top again absolutely I will bring my friends to hike together.We took the metro green line 2 from Seomyeon to Jangsan - 18 stops, about half hour ride, grab a seat soonest possible. Took Exit 10 and followed the main road (hint: head towards the mountain) to park entrance - about 15-20 min walk. A nice warmup to what's ahead, we walked up the road about another 20 mins to a large open area (hint: giant hula hoops). There are temples midway (hint: temple music & sounds). The waterfall was kinda non-existent - probably due to low rainfall. Go up the rocky steps (hint: hula hoops on your right, rocky steps on left). Else attempt the 45deg paved road - make sure you don't trip else it'd be a messy descent. There are milestones along the road for you to decide whether to go on the beginner/intermediate/advance trails. At one point, we came to barbed wire indicating land mines beyond the fence. We stayed on the right side. Funnily, as we passed one section, a booming voice came over the PA system - we reckon it was a reminder to stay on the path and not wander into the land mines. After a while seeing no one, we started to wonder whether we were on the right path. Fortunately a few locals, on their descent, told us to continue. We pushed on and finally reached the top. Fantastic view of Gwangandaeyo, Haeundae, Igidae. Couldn't see Oryukdo which was beyond a hill/island. Total time to & fro park entrance and mountain top was about 5 hours including meal & photo breaks. Great way to kick off our hiking vacation!Wear sturdy and comfortable hiking shoes with good grip a must.I went last weekend to the top of Jangsan Mountain. It was a really nice view above Busan but difficult to find right way because of no signs at the way. In advance I had look at the Internet to find a description for the way. (Take Subway to Jangsan station and go out at exit 10. Then always straight on until you reach the Daecheon Park and than follow the way ""Peak""). Signs are very sporadic. So I had ask a married couple and they were so friendly that they allowed me to follow them :). I would recommend to climb to the top of mountain <U+263A> It was wonderfulThis is a really popular place with locals. The paths are pretty wide and easy to walk, but some places get pretty steep. They label the difficulty of paths pretty clearly and there're little benches along the paths.In mid-April this year, we climbed up this mountain. What a feat it was, for us novice climbers! We got lost along the way, but some basic Korean and friendly hikers made sure that we reached the peak, after 3 hours or so. Getting up was more challenging than it should have been because there were no signposts, and we often ran into dead corners/carparks. We also made a loop around north of the mountain instead of climbing directly up. Steep slopes and rocks made it rather tiring for us. We were glad to reach 200m within the peak, and we contemplated whether to go up or not. After persisting (in my opinion, the last 200m was the toughest part because of the rockiness), we were awarded with a beautiful view. We didn't stay long though, because we forgot to bring snacks and water up. Down we went by the proper route, crossing through closed eateries and encountering a wild dog along the way. In total, the hike was 6 hours for us.For future hikers: I would give directions, but we went by the longer route. The first part of the hike was fine, but it gets tougher nearer the peak. You MUST bring snacks up, because we ignored the advice from a blog, and couldn't really appreciate the peak properly due to our hunger. Good hiking shoes are highly recommended too. This is not an easy climb, but the satisfaction is worth it.A Nice trip. Nice nature and a incredible view of the city when you reach the top. Near Heaundae beach. In the spring you can see a lot of flowers. In the summer it could be to hot. Don't forget to bring water. I recommend the walk<U+263A><U+FE0F>I was pretty surprised when I noticed that this hike has not been added to TripAdvisor yet. This is one of my all time favorite places in Busan, mostly because it's so close to our front door. Jangsan or Jang Mountain is the large mountain that nestles Haeundae Beach. And believe it or not you can hike all the way to it's peak for an incredible view of the city and it's surroundings. This hike is super beautiful, although near the top it can be a little unsettling to see ""Danger Land Mine"" signs, but don't worry the area is barb wired off. For real though they weren't able to fully confirm complete removal of mines from the Korean War.There are a couple different routes to get to the top, the easiest to find is the riding the Subway to the Jangsan Station, leaving out of exit 12 and following the road until you get to the park. Once in the park just follow the signs for ""Peak."" It can be kind of confusing as sometimes the English on the signs goes away and you need to look for signs that say 장산 (Jangsan) or just ask a fellow hiker and they will point the way. The second way, and the better way in my opinion is taking the Subway to Dongbaek Station, and heading out of exit 4. Make a U-turn to the right out of the top of the stairs onto the sidewalk headed East. Walk about 100ft and you will see a small walkway tunnel on your left. Pass through it and take a right down a small gravel road to a small farming village surrounded by apartment buildings. Follow the gravel road till the end and turn left facing up the hill. You will see the start of a zigzag path that heads up the mountain. Take this path all the way to the peak, don't worry about the forks in the road, they all connect back together, but a good rule of thumb is always stay left. The hike itself can be challenging at times, and gets pretty steep in a lot of sections, round trip it's about 7-8miles so it's best if you set a whole afternoon aside to make it to the top. Also if you bring 1,000won there is a guy who always sells Popsicles at the top during the summer! It's a nice cooling reward for the effort! I would also make sure it's a clear day, the views are a lot better when there is blue sky. On a really, really clear day you can see Tsushima Island, Japan!"

금정 산성,130건의<U+00A0>리뷰,부산 금정구,23위(244곳의 부산 소재 관광지 중),"We decided to make healthy trekking and we did not know that there is also a fortress. The fortress itself was not impressing, but the long wall (kind of low Chinese great wall) was interesting to see! We run out of the water and there is no place to buy it - but local well helped us!Watch from a distance. Just a fortress remain and if you don't read about ti before visiting, it will be easily ignored.So, honestly, the Fortress is just a big 'ol wall with trees and weeds growing around it. It is not why you should go, but you should go. There is a cable car up if you need it, but I recommend hiking up. The hike is about an hour and it doesn't require a moderate level of fitness but the best views are from the hike, not the view at the top of the cable car. Also, from the Fortress you can continue a short hike to Seokbulsa temple. Follow the signs for Namman village, it is the only other road leading from the Fortress Gate opposite direction as the cable car. Go through the village and take the trail to the left heading up into the forest. It will take you to a long set of stairs heading down. The path will eventually come out at a road. Go right up hill along the road. Bit of a steep trek but at the top is Seokbulsa Temple and the beautiful stone carvings hidden behind the temple. You can either backtrack to the cable car or continue down the road and work your way to the metro (bit of a walk, Naver would be helpful here).We got the cable car, having walked from Oncheonjang station to the 'ropeway' station. The signs aren't great but we were using satnav so it was fine. The cablecar itself looks like it's from the 60s (in a good way- vintage rather than unsafe) with great views of the city as you go up. We were there on a Wednesday and it was pretty empty. Once at the top there were a number of walkers and we followed signs through the woodland to the south gate of the fortress. It was nice to see and lovely woods. If we'd had longer it would have been good to do a more challenging walk to one of the other gates or temples nearby.Took metro red line 1 to Beomeosa. At Exit 7 road level, immediately u-turn and take 1st right and walk up a small road to bus stop 90 (big letters which one can't miss) - it's the only bus which goes to Beomeosa Temple. Unfortunately I read some blogs which didn't mention this precious detail and cost us 45 mins of aimless wandering and sweating. After asking a few shops, we found this bus 90. Devil is in the details.The bus stopped at the temple entrance. We walked up the road and came to temple entrance. Continued to walk to back of temple (parking for temple stay) and started our hike to North Gate. The terrain was akin to a river of rocks, I kid you not. Fortunately we all had proper hiking shoes and most of us had hiking sticks. About 1.7km later, we reached North Gate - basically just an entrance with a wall running up and down. We had a choice to turn left and go towards East Gate and then to South Gate, else turn right for Godangbong Peak (1km). We all voted for the peak cos we wanted to have our picnic lunch at the peak. After more trudging up staircases and slopes for 30~40 mins, we hit the peak and were greeted by 3 cats - go figure. Scenery was a million bucks; egg and luncheon meat sandwiches with apples and pears tasted all the sweeter. After a photo session, we made our way back to North Gate and retraced our route to Beomeosa Temple. Bus 90 back to town - don't miss it cos the next one comes every 20ish minutes.I saw on the map that it was close to the Temple so though I would kill two birds with one stone. The trail up to the North gate from the temple is well marked and even has ropes to keep you on the track. BUT the track is steep, and in places very steep and you are stepping up rough stones that have been laid in a pathway, which is challenging for the legs. Took me just under the hour to get to the north gate and then another 30 minutes to make it to the peak of Mt Geumjeogsan for some big views, again well formed path with steps in the steep bits. By the time I had done this I was pooped, so headed back down the temple rather than heading out towards the other gates.Well , we have begin the fortress n'y the South Gare, with the ropeway which gives a nice view on the Busan Bay. I recommand if you want to go to the North gate 3 things : water, compass to follow the North and the Korean map ( the english Map is useless because the ways are in koreans). If you have this 3 things it is a very Nice travel not really difficult and you CAN sometimes walk on the remparts ( East Gate) and have really Nice view on the Town or the Mountains ( near the North Gate). Metro to metro it is a 12 kilometres walking .. about 4 - 5 Hours.Great fortress.West, East, South gate are easy to access.North gate is to approach from other gate or Bomosa.Anyway each gate is worth visiting.We travelled up the cable car, expecting to be at the top, but in fact there was a long walk from where the cable car stopped. It was light bushland with a reasonably good series of tracks and plenty of signage.An enjoyable outing with good exercise!We took the cable car and walked to South Gate.

범어사,884건의<U+00A0>리뷰,부산 금정구 청룡동 546,4위(244곳의 부산 소재 관광지 중),"Went end of October but trees are still mostly green. Interesting 600 year old fertile female Gingko trees with lots of Gingko fruits. Nice walk uphill.The temple is ok, like many other korean temples but it gets very crowded. The setting is beautiful and hiking to the diffent hermitages is even better than the temple itself in my opinionCaught metro then the 90 bus. we went on Sunday and lots of walkers. We planned on seeing temple and then walk up to north gate. The walk was strenuous but picturesque.When we reached gate we saw people on top of mountain and decided to walk part way and before we knew it we were nearly at top and then went all way. It was worth it has it has 360 degree views. Definitely recommend walk to top it took 4 hours there and back from temple.Beomeosa Temple is easily accessible by train to Beomeosa Station (Exit 5) on the orange line. Recommended to take a taxi from Beomesosa Station up to the temple to save your energy walking uphill, costing Krw 4500 or less. Unfortunately, it was raining when we arrive and we could only cover the temple ground missing the walking around the temple vicinity. What a waste!After a long drive a very good place to get out and walk around. Would liked to walk the trails but we did not have time.This is a nice hotel up in the hills. Its in the outskirts of Busan but very easy to find using Naver Maps. I recommend taking a taxi from the closest subway station. Its very cheap (KRW3500) and takes you all the way up to the temple unlike the bus.Got nice buildings and nice view. It also have a stream nearby.Beomeosa Temple is one of the important temples to visit in South Korea. You can reach the temple via hiking over the Geumjeongsan temple or reach Beomeosa subway station and then take a 15 min bus ride to the temple. I have tried them both but hiking gave me a wonderful experience. The trails are completely easy to follow up, plus the added beautiful scenery. One of the must-visit places in Busan3p* Beomosa Temple
Walk uphill, lots of steps, difficult, through three beautiful gates
Several prayer forums; need to take off shoes; no photos inside
Stone lantern
Stone pagodaVisited Beomeosa temple on a rainy day, the atmosphere was extraordinary! A peaceful place, the temple consists of numerous praying halls, each beautiful and unique. Highly recommended!This temple is a must visit when in Busan. The temple has quite a big car park, but you can also take the public transport to get there. The temple is beautiful in itself, but the surroundings make every visit unforgettable. We loved the impressive collection of buddha statues. You can experience the temple to the fullest during a temple stay, but even if you're just stopping by for a short visit, you'll love observing the bustling temple life. When we visited there were several ceremonies going on."

금강 공원,91건의<U+00A0>리뷰,부산 동래구 우장춘로 155 (우) 607-061,54위(244곳의 부산 소재 관광지 중),"The cable cars take you up to a picnic area and a bunch of hiking trails.The cars doesnt go at set times either and if you are unlucky you may find yourself waiting for a long time before the cars move.I had to wait 30 minutes before a couple of locals appeared and made the staff start the car. If they hadn't told the staff off we would've still be sitting in that car. The only people we encountered at the top were hikers. going to the south gate is basically going through small forest trails and is not suitable if you are wearing clothing for urban walking. I had sneakers, jeans and a t.shirt and regretted that walk. The south gate is not even close to the cable cars and its basically just a gate. so unless you want to go on a longer hike and wear clothing sutied for hiking then do not go here.Take the cable car from Geumgang Park for some breath taking views on Busan and its surroundings. The ride in itself is unforgettable, but when you reach the top it's only a short walk to the Geumjeongsanseong fortifications. The walk is nice and quite easy. Lovely!The ride offers spectacular views of Busan. Once at the top it's hiking time. You can go to Seokbulsa (unfortunately it was late and the air was bad) or to the mountain fortress, which is not very demanding. It closes at 6 so don't go too late in the afternoon. Park entrance is 10 min walk from Oncheonjang stationThe cable car ride offers a fantastic view of Busan and how the city is laid out.Signages at the top are not sufficient and can be confusing for an English speaker.The South Gate is nothing monumental but okay for a little stroll.Go for the view but definitely purchase round trip tickets for the cable car.On saying that I have come across many Korean hikers along the way so this might be good for those who are into trekking.Convenient to the Myeongyun metro station. Catch the cable car up to the top, then you have a variety of choices for beautiful walks including to the Seokbul-sa monastery with its beautiful cliff rock carvings. Park provides free insect repellent spray but we weren't bothered by any insects at all.Even though you are told otherwise the cable car is only accessible via two flights of stairs and a really steep hill from the car park

Do not attempt unless you can walkWe got promised amazing views but there weren't any! The so called ""observatory"" is a nice picknick area with tables etc. but it is within a clearing. So you haven't any views over Busan at all - just trees around you. If you love hiking this park is perfect for it but do not expect great views over the city - or only when using the cable car!Appears to be some great hikes around here. . but if you're a tourist and you go up a cable car you sort of expect great views back down . . not really the case here apart from of tiny bit of the city from the cable car. . . once you get up there its woods, muddy walks and the occasional brick gate . . also some screeching karaok-ing Koreans half way up which was beyond odd. . . . its a long way out of town for it to be a 'must do' for a weekend tourist.....This is a lovely park both winter and summer. If you are a hiker it's a good hike up to the fortress with walking trail around the fortress wall. Or you can take the cable car to the top and walk as far as you want. The cable car is 8,000kw return and provides a great view, on a clear day, of Gwangan Bridge. To get there take Metro Line 1 to Oncheonjang station. Take exit 1, turn left and then right at the next main intersection. Follow the brown signs to the park. You can see the cable car from the metro exit. Well worth a visit.Came here not for the park but to take the cable car to the top of Geumjeong Mountain where there's the ""much-talked-about"" Seokbulsa Temple with giant rock carvings of Buddha; as it turned out though, I actually came here for the great views of the pretty tall 20-to-40-storied buildings of the city which are ""spread out all over the city"" (not just concentrated in one area of the city as is the case in some big cities), and yes the big mountains beyond the city provide an excellent ""nature backdrop"" to make these aerial scenes from the cable car ""absolutely memorable""! Being said that though, despite those great views from the cable car (as mentioned above), there's ""nothing much"" on top of the mountain itself, and I wasn't able to find the temple I came for; I'm sure I got ""pretty close"" to it (maybe just like 5 minutes from the temple) following the signs & asking people on the trails, going past the popular South Gate (about a 20-minute walk from the cable car station on the top) where I made like a U-turn and walked another 10 minutes to Nammun Village but gave up after another 5 minutes or so when getting to like two ""pretty steep steps"" leading downward since I wasn't sure I would be able to come back up those steps; also, I was ""pressed for time"" with the last cable car to go down the mountain leaving at 6 30 pm and it takes like 45 minutes to get back to the cable car station from that temple (Seokbulsa) with the rock carvings (yes ""the 6 30 pm for the last cable car going down"" is everyone coming up the mountain should keep in mind, whether you're going to Seokbulsa or not, since I'm sure it would take much much longer to go back down on foot compared to only like a little over 5 minutes with the cable car either uphill or downhill).If coming from Busan Station (after arriving by train), it's quite convenient to get here by taking the subway Line 1 from Busan Metro Station (right beside the train station) to Oncheonjang Station from which it's about a 20-minute walk: a left turn after getting out of the station from its front side & going on the overpass, then a right turn about 5 minutes later followed by a pretty much straight way (which becomes slightly uphill) for about 10 to 15 minutes, then a right turn again and you'll see the park on your left shortly after. About the park itself though, there's really nothing much to say except there are some nice flower beds right outside the entrance, and there's a playground or a mini-theme park with some rides (probably just for kids) inside not far from the cable car station."
타워갤러리,35건의<U+00A0>리뷰,부산 부산 사상구 삼락동 73-3,63위(244곳의 부산 소재 관광지 중),"I really enjoyed this, very cheap to do, amazing gardens below. Hop in one of the two lifts and enjoy the lovely 360 degree view from the top. In the tower there is two levels, I suggest head to the lower level where the exit elevator is and there is usually no one there, and the windows are on a better angle for a better view. Really enjoyed this place and I rate it 5/5The tower is distinct in it's height and very visible. It offers a great view of the city and I recommend visiting it.Yongdusun Park is just within walking distance from Nampodong area. The name literally translate to Dragon Head's mountain. Since I'm a dragon, I guess this is my mountain. Yongdusun is also the home of the Busan Tower. It's closed the day I visited but visiting its base near sunset did offer some pretty amazing views. I could only imagine the amazing view that would have rewarded me from the top of the tower. But the view from the bottom isn't any less interesting. People are interesting. Makes them interesting to watch. Statue of General Yi Sun, a great naval commander during the 16the century. So they build a large statue of him to show how important he is. Apart from tower that dominates the park, there's also plenty of pavilion and smaller towers to act as great backdrops for instagram selfies. Make sure you budget ample time here to account for that.I took my family here way back many, many years ago. It was a great ride up. It was like going up more than 30 feet in a split of a second. The next thing we were on top. Great view from up there indeed.The tower affords panoramic views of the whole city area. At the bottom of the tower there are souvenir shops.  It would have been good for photographs to go there at night.Busan tower is position in Yongdusan Park. You can't miss it as it towers over the city.For a small entrance fee you can enter and go up to the viewing area of the tower gallery.From here you can see a 360 degree view all over the city. When we were there the view was very clear. You can see for miles. You can quite easily spend a good hour there. I guess the views at night would be spectacular and the sunsets really good.At the bottom of the tower you can place a lock of love on the railings. These are sold in the souvenir shop. I really wished I had bought several as I can't find these any where else in the world. Would I recommend visiting the tower - yes I would.This 118-metre-high tower is situated at Yongdusan Park, on top of Yongdusan Mountain (“Dragon’s Head” mountain). We followed the road sign (on top of the manhole covers) and climbed up the nice shaded steps to the Tower. I don’t remember how much we paid to go up observation deck, but the panoramic view of the city and harbour was worth the money. The base of the tower has a gallery and souvenir shops. We went in to take a look, I even bought 2 packs of magnets there.Happy Travelling!I'm a big fan of towers. I love seeing the entire city from above. Busan Tower did not disappoint. If you can, time it for evening as the lights are coming and the city seems to be coming alive. No matter the time of day you go, the views are well worth it!From the top of the Busan Tower you can enjoy the unique 360 degrees view of Busan town and also capture breathtaking pictures.

Enjoy your coffee at the Cafe located one floor behind the top one. Also there is a gallery with very nice exhibits.We did not find the escalator in the beginning and went up by walking uphill from other side where we found some arts shop. The scenery looked great. We also found love locks at the garden near the base of the tower. When going up (fee required), don't forget to take video on the display on top of your elevator. Spectacular views will be seen on a sunny day with 360 degree at the city. You can also find the distances n direction display towards your homeland. Souvenir can be bought in the small shop. A place worth to visit."

We had so much fun and would definitely visit again.Our group are a well travelled team of escape artists and we very fond of the Dark Magic room. Our escape experience was actually supposedto take place at a different escape company, however due to taxi difficulties we arrived late and they no longer held our reservation. We found that there are numerous other escape rooms within a 5-minute walk of their location. We were informed that Game of Minds had rooms in English so headed on over. The staff were friendly and helpful and luckily had a couple of rooms available for us to try.The Dark Magic room is of medium difficulty, but very well constructed with a lot of effort placed into making it seem like you are in Harry Potter's world. We were out in 30.03 (the fastest time of the month), and enjoyed the experience. Things inside the room were well translated into English.Would definately visit here again!My coworkers and I were looking or something fun to do and decided to do an escape room. We used their website to make a reservation and showed up a little before our session. The staff was friendly and the directions were in English, so with somebody help from the staff (CCTV cameras and English audio hints) we were able to complete the escape room.We had a really fun time here, we played the ""Dark Magic"" game, and we enjoyed it very much, there were some ""elements"" that made the experience even better. And after we finished they took a photo of us in some theme related costumes with our finish time and printed it without any extra charge.We are a couple of escape room enthusiasts who have done 40+ rooms in several countries. We did the Harry Potter themed room (four stars), the Davinci room (four stars), and the VR room (two stars). The VR was an interesting novelty, but we didn't especially enjoy it. Of the other two I think we liked Davinci more, though the Harry Potter one was fun as we are fans."
삼광사,68건의<U+00A0>리뷰,부산 부산진구 초읍천로33번길 29-7,41위(244곳의 부산 소재 관광지 중),"I didn't expect it to be so huge. Very well maintained, and very active, they had ceremonies in several halls at the same time. Great spot to do some hiking on the trails behind it. All in all, a very serene and beautiful place. Easy access too, bus 15 took us from Somyeon directly there.This temple complex is very large and during the week or 2 before Buddha's Birthday extensive lanterns are hung and placed and it is jaw dropping amazing to see. Photos can hardly do it justice, but you will have wonderful photos to share. Do not wait until the actual day of Buddha's birth because the crowds are also gigantic. Come before sunset and watch as the lanterns are lit.Wasn’t expecting much when we reached destination but was wowed by the spectacular scenery. Weather was cool, view awesome, best of all free. Took lots of pretty photos but unable to post due is size of photosI came by at night time and was surprised to find meditation taking placemany people were there singing and praying and it made me want to joinso I did, and they even have a spot for ppl who ant to lie down for a little sleep timethe temple is big and inviting, I had a very spiritual experience and I'm happy and lucky to have come there :]Incidentally ran into this place...not a regret to have some nice shots..close proximity to city...relaxingattended Lantern festival (29 Apr-22 May) in evening. I followed directions on the Visit Korea website, took Seomyeon Station then waited for bus 15 for 30 mins. tired of waiting, so left on an alternate bus and ended up walking for 30 mins. it was crowded but worth the visit. huge temple and park i believe (didnt explore far from temple since it was dark) beautiful lanterns overhead on stairs to the temple. also had lantern sculptures.I am not sure why this temple seems to be so underrated. It is much bigger and more elaborate than many of the other, more well know temples in the area. I love it here, one of my favourite spots in the city. The statues and carvings are amazing and there are some nice view both of the temple itself and looking back at the city. It is especially beautiful right now as it is coming up to the lantern festival and the entire temple complex is covered in lanterns. Absolutely stunning site to see. You can also hike maybe 30 mins to a smaller and more quaint temple- Seonamsa, from here. Also a nice place to visit, more relaxing and tranquil.We went there a week before Buddha's birthday so the area is well decorated and picture perfect. The area also has proper signages for the tourists.One of the best temples we have visited so far. We visited in the early morning and liked the serene atmosphere to offer our prayer. Located at the base of a small hill, it is not far from Busan City Center. The view of the city from the Temple is fantastic on a clear day. The landscape and flowers are heart catching. It is open 24 hours. There is a latern festival every year during the month of April which lasts for a month; it is the best time to visit. From Seomyeon Metro Station exit 13 and take Mini Bus 81 or 133 which drops you at the temple.. The bus stop is in front of Holly's Coffee. Recommended while in Busan.temple, busan, KoreaAfter trekking up the hill towards the start of the mountain and dark clouds over my head I headed straight up to the slope of a minders road to hill horizon. On that hill I found a monastery and heard on approach the chanting of a lone monk and the drum, banging at moments to awaken feelings of people inside, or that was the case. A beautiful collection of buildings matched in the colours of heavenly greens blues and the orcha colours of the earthy worlds governed by the laws of nature and time. In the distance and closer as I paced a pagoda with golden bells sounded off in the wind passing the sprit world and surrounded by folk figures I have only been able to view once I entered this land. On the wall had many reliefs of the gods and stories told by the faith of Buddhism and many more realistic impressions of flowers this land had come to known. The sun came out to greet me once I reached he main temple and as I went inside I saw people bowing their heads to the hard wooden floor, it thundered as movement went across it. Indeed it echoed in my mind and standing outside staring off the mountain into busan I felt the calm again, like a missing old friend I finally felt it again, I understood over the last few months I had been moving to fast and rapped up in my own pace that I rarely stopped to feel it again, but here it held me and let the clouds of my mind slip away."
석불사,80건의<U+00A0>리뷰,부산 북구 만덕1동 산2,20위(244곳의 부산 소재 관광지 중),"We arrived via subway (Oncheonjang Station) and up the cable car; we followed internet directions to reach the South gate, after that we got lost.The fact that it was raining on and off and the few signs didn’t help us. After a while we went through a little village (main dish they offered was duck bulgogi) and afterwards down (bridge/little river/rocks) and up (steep part). After hiking for 5+ hours through the mountain we finally reached Seokbulsa temple and it was worth it!It started raining again; there was only a couple walking around and soon we had the place all to ourselves. We have seen several temples, but got to admit the wall carvings are truly unique. We were thankful for 2 things: the drink vending machine a little before reaching the temple and for not slipping down the rocks along the way and being hurt.Arriving through the road (not the cable car) there are taxis that can save you around three fourths of the steep ascent, but missed one going the opposite way so had to walk down and had some food mid-way at a nice looking cafe.Once we reached the bottom since we arrived from a different place and there was no subway around we asked a guy waiting for the bus and told us to cross the street and take the bus; we did and arrived at Minam subway station to change to line 4.I enjoyed the hiking, but my teenage son hated it. My body hurt the next day, but I was still smiling.We left the Busan Tower area at 7:15 am and were back by 11 am - an easy half-day activity. Not sure why everyone says it‘s so hard to get to. We took subway line 1 to Dondae, then took bus 46. Just put Seokbulsa in Kakao Map, and this is the path it shows. The bus drops you off right at the 1.5 km path through woods and onto a sort of street to the temple. It took us 30 min. from there. The last 500m were the steepest. English and Korean signs all the way up. And it seems you could drive/get a taxi up if you really needed to. There were only 2 others there when we arrived. It was so peaceful and beautiful - the rock carvings, the views... a true highlight on our Busan trip. We were too early for the cable car on the way out. Thought we could take the cable car down, but the signage to find that path from the temple was questionable, so just took the same path back down. Would suggest going up with the cable car and back down toward Mandeok to the 46 bus. There are plenty of signs down.This temple was the highlight of our Busan visit. You can reach after taking the Geumgang Cable Car, but there is also a bus stop not to far away from the temple. We took the cable car and had a hard time finding the temple. We had to ask for directions, but luckily found a very friendly Korean gentleman who showed us the way. The walk to the temple was not easy, so you'll need to be in shape.But when you reach this temple everything is forgotten. The view on Busan is breath taking, but what makes this temple truly unforgettable are the magnificent rock carvings. What a tremendous feat!This temple is very hard to get to. We took the metro and then we hiked for a good 1h before we got there and the path is not an easy one. Since the temple is on top of a mountain, the hike is straight up. But honestly, once you get there, it is SOOOOOOO worth it. The views are breathtaking and the carvings on the stones are so beautiful. Once you get there, there is such a big sense of piece. I would really recommend it.Firstly, we came here by car and the journey up was quite something. Basically just keep going until you can’t go no further! It will mean going up some rather steep roads but there is a small car park at the top (just a level down from the actual temple - much better than parking early and climbing the steep slopes up). The stone carvings are like nothing I’ve ever seen. Really interesting and impressive. I also tried to find the room with loads of buddhas but was unable to? The air up there is very clean and fresh. Good views in places.Nice relaxing place for worship and scenery in Busan, Korea. Public bus transport at Won12,000 from outside Haeundae station to bus stop along main road from temple. Then a nice stroll to temple ground. Temple have simple route to main hall complex. Entrance is free and relaxing place to pray too. A spring head provides cool refreshing water to drink too. Avoid morning tourist timing and the crowd is manageable. Stroll around the temple complex and toss a coin from small bridge, visit the temple prayer hall and then walk to seaside area. Under ground room is cool and half a day is sufficient.My husband and I spent 6 long months working in South Korea. During our time off we often visit temples and this by far our favorite. It is a little difficult to locate, but not too bad considering we didn't know the language and were still able to find it. We drove most of the way up to it and parked along the road. We were not sure what the road would be like further up and had a large vehicle, so pulled over and parked where we could. This place is AMAZING. Large carvings in the cliff. A room with thousands of buddhas. Very, very quiet and peaceful. Not a lot of people. It felt like a real sanctuary on top of a busy city. Definitely recommend!Seokbulsa is small but different than other temples in Busan due to the huge stone carvings behind the temple. Certainly worth checking out. You can come most of the way by vehicle or you can hike from the Fortress if you want to combine the sites and get a little exercise.The most beautiful temple I've seen in Korea! Most authentic and impressive compared to all those ""mambo jambo"" touristic temples. Worth the visit in Busan!This place is seldom be mentioned in any guidebook in Asia. I just found this place accidentally through a news website. Before visiting this place, my husband n I found there r lots of routs to go to the temple on the internet. So we choose to take the subway to Mandeok Station( exit 2) first as our plan. Once u got out of the station, u'll see signs in English all the way which indicate the direction to Seokbulsa. So u don't have to worry about getting lost in the mountains. But I still recommend people who wanna go to Seokbulsa better learn how to read Seokbulsa in Korean. Cause there r signs indicate shortcuts in Korean on the way. Actually we should walk for at least 1.5 hr to get there, but we took the shortcuts n got there less than an hr. I don't know how to type ""Seokbulsa"" in Korean, but it's at the right n top of the 1st pic.The path is kind of hard for climbers especially the last 600 meters to the destination. U'd better not to take any little kids with you. The path is kind rough even for an adult.  The views on the way r really great. Once u got to the temple, u will feel it really worth it."

It's a must see if you're in Busan!Lots of colorful houses near the water provide the setting for a sweet vacation spot. Bring good shoes, as it is quite hilly here. Good place to find souvenirs. Most enjoyable walking around and finding the unexpected treasures.계단식으로 배열된 작은 주택들이 밀집되어 있는 곳. 주택 벽에는 파스텔 빛 페인트가 칠해져 있어 멀리서 보면 알록달록 이색적인 풍경을 볼 수 있다. 실제로 사람들이 거주하고 있는 공간이기 때문에 관광할 때는 관광질서를 지켜야 한다.A great place to wander round and see the old style houses and the little museums and when you need a coffee break you can find a place that looks out over the rest of the colourfully painted suburbInteresting place to go on your own by taxi. With 2 GFs, we had a good time with lots of pictures taken with the painted mural walls, a village of colorful houses. The main attraction was finding the statue of Little Prince perching on a platform, overlooking the colorful village of houses. Long queue to take photo with Little Prince. Lots of local souvenirs to hunt for.. we bought pretty hats to coordinate in our photo taking.Overall worthwhile to roam around with my 2 GFs.Thoroughly enjoyed walking through this historical area (for refugees of Korean War). Today, it offers fun photo opportunities, snacks and crafts.The best thing to do here is to get lost! We got our bearings over coffee in the Avant Garde Cafe at the top of the hill where the taxi rank and buses are, then set off. We managed to discover a temple, the House of Peace and the Steps to the Stars (luckily on the way down!) and several interesting murals and colourful statues of people and animals. There was a massive queue by the Little Prince and his fox so we didn’t hang around for a photo.Of all the places we visited in Seoul and Busan, htis cultural village tops our list!! It reminds me of the Rocinha favela that we visited in Rio de Janeiro many years ago. This village is so unique and full of character. Despite the narrow lanes that snake through the residents' houses, I don't feel claustrophobic or cramped like I did when I visited the Hanok Village in Seoul. There are also many quaint shops and tea houses here. Overall, it is a very classy place, and not too touristic or tacky. I love ths place! Highly recommended!!!"

Lovely walk along the bridge.It was good at cable car to see the view but not worth to go because far from other place. Not much interesting thing to see.We read 'SkyWalk' so we were expecting something a little higher! It is a walkway over the sea just a few metres above the the sea level. There is, in parts, the opportunity to look down through very scratched plexi glass to the sea below, which is also somewhat dark. Don't expect to see fish swimming around underneath the walkway, Busan is a very busy sea port and the sea reflects this. At one point you have to scramble over rocks to reach the viewing area at the end, this could be very difficult for less able folk or wheelchairs,Just like several others, Songdo skywalk is another sea view strolling location at Busan. It is near the Songdo beach. You can have a great view of the sea, shores, bridge and all around. Walking over the bridge and near the area is very comfortable. There is a cable car nearby to have a view of the whole area from top, but ground views from skywalk are just as fine as well. A good photo shoot location.This area is really pretty, especially during sunset. The skywalk takes you a little bit further out which gives you a very nice view of Songdo Beach. Just be aware of the seagulls as a lot of people are feeding them in the area.A nice little promenade out from the beach front, but really not much more than a pier! You do get a pretty good view of the big ships waiting to come in to port though. The beach itself is fairly average but it seems to be patrolled. If you’re from somewhere like Australia which has beautiful beaches, I wouldn’t go there on purpose.The sky walk and the cable car is located at the Songdo beach. It's near Gamcheon village. You can grab a taxi from the village. The skywalk is very long and cool.It’s a walkway over the water with scratched plexi glass in a few spots. The beach might be fun to hang out in fur a day, thoughThis is near Gamcheong cultural village. Good to drop by here to take some photos after visiting the village. The skywalk is not very long and you should be done with this place within 30 mins. Go this place only if it is on the way."

Lots of restaurants and bars to choose from and a wonderful beach to stroll along- plus the convenience of the compressed air pumps to clean the sand off your shoes afterwards.We visited this beach early in October, and it was very lively and so full of lights. The view of he Diamond Bridge all lighted up was spectacular. There were also many concerts and live performances going on at the beach. We also saw fireworks - beautiful place to be at night. I doubt it will look so interesting and good during daytime. Plenty of restaurants and bars around for dinner. We thoroughly enjoyed our night visit here to the ebach. Highly recommended!!!This beach to great to come to, to stroll around and there are plently of restaurants to choose fromCame in the evening, Gwangandaegyo Bridge night view is beautiful. 

I suggest come before sunset and stay til early evening.Take Line 2 to Gwangan Station and walk from Exit 5.Turn right and walk for 5 minutes down 7 blocks to arrive at Gwangalli Beach.Perfect for a day out at the beachLovely fees and clean, nearby restaurant and coffee shop, with sea view. Would have like to spend more time hereThe sun sets perfectly well at Gwangalli Beach giving you a beautiful reason to end the day. The view from the beach is breathtaking. Too bad, South Korea seems to have a litter problem where there are literally litter at most popular tourists beaches. If not for the litter, it will be a great beach to visit.Best time to go is late afternoon/sunset and evening.There are a lot of shops, restaurants and nightclubs all around.Here you can often find shows in the street, like outdoor theater!Beautiful and young atmosphere!One of my favourite place in Busan.you can easily reach that beach by taxi. It is a free beach access with the chance to rent a sunbed and a parasole (10,000 each). Nice sandy beach and more quite that Haeundae beachIt was crazy crowded and water wasn’t clean. I didn’t get why it is one of the famous beaches. Whatever... I didn’t like swimming but there were so many sea shells. If you like collecting them, it is good place. Especially if you have children <U+200D>♀<U+FE0F> We liked being there night time. There were so many street musicians, gwangan bridge was very nice. There were so many restaurants, pubs.

태종대,"1,018건의<U+00A0>리뷰",부산 영도구 동삼동,8위(244곳의 부산 소재 관광지 중),"We took a bus from central Busan to the last stop at a place where we were approached by a man who asked us whether we wanted to take a boat trip around the park's coast. We agreed, and were driven to the port by a free-shuttle bus. From there, we took a boat ride around the southern tip of Busan. After the boat trip, we walked to the Park and explored it by foot and also took a train which runs around the park. Very interesting place to be, especially the views from the lighthouse.A lot of walking involved, so wear comfortable shoes!A nice park to spend a few hours in. Green forests, rocky beach, temples and monuments are only part of what this place has to offer.It was raining and the Danubi train doesn't operate even when it drizzles. Be prepared to climb 4.5km up to the top. It was an awesome slow walk up.Despite the endless steps, this place is stunningly beautiful.Great angle and position for photos. It was breathtaking. Though the time spent here was short, it was really worth it!Taking bus no 8 from Jagalchi to Taejongdae. The fare is about 1.2k. Then walking around 5 minutes to the entrance to catch a Danubi Train. (3k per ride ~ with 3 stop). The view is awesome. A lot of stairs but just chill and walk slowly so you can enjoy the view.Amazing view of the cliff, the lighthouse everything. You should come here early morning if you want to catch avoid the queue for the Danube train going up. But you can hike all the way up for around 30mins.The view is beautiful, lighthouse in the cliffside. But the you need to take stairs going down and up. A bit tiring for us, who are not so physically active.Beautifully sunny day day hot work but worth it. Lots of climbing steps to get there but all well organisedThe scenic view is stunning ! Try also the lighthouse. But you will need to be enduring, found downstairs and upstairs. Should be done during sunny days !Took a taxi from our hotel to here. Relatively easy walking in a loop which takes a couple of hours allowing for stops. Nice views; a few steps to the lighthouse. We went down to a pebble beach where the ferry trips go from and raw fish was being sold."
태종대유원지,16건의<U+00A0>리뷰,부산 영도구 전망로 24 (우) 49127,86위(244곳의 부산 소재 관광지 중),"There are lots to see at Taejongdae Resort Park. Unfortunately I had little time, therefore I went straight to Yeongdo Lighthouse as that was the ""must-see"" attraction for me. You can choose to walk the entire park or take the Danubi Train, which I opted for due to time constraints.We turned up at the wrong time and the trackless Danubi Train service was not operating due to safety reasons as the roads were wet from the long drizzle. It was a large and expansive park so we decided save our walk and give the attractions a miss to visit another attraction nearby.You may chose to walk around this Park, or pay 3000W for the Danubi Train, which has 3 stops (namely Observation Deck, The Light House and The Temple). You may get in or off at any station. Personally first and second stops are recommended, but not really at the third stops. Prepare to walk and climb stairs especially to the Light House. Going up the spinning stair to the top of Light House, and you could enjoy panoramic view of the area, breath taking. If you have more time, walking down further and you could buy and enjoy some fresh oyster!If you plan to visit this Park, avoid weekends as waiting and taking the Danubi could be long with tourists and local crowds.You could also take a small ferry with a fees around the park, agents will approach you just before entrance to the Park.We went there as part of Busan city tour package and inside the park we took danubi train bus which takes you around inside the park. We stop by at one of the few look outs and enjoyed the view. If you have time, worthwhile to give a visit.alot of nice views and photo stopstake the train if u are lazy to walk do note the waiting time is around 30 mins.This is my second visit after more than 5 years and the place is as nice as I remembered it. Visited on a warm sunny day and the seaviews were spectacular. The divers/fishermen were out in full force selling their catch at the foot of the cliffs.

자갈치 시장,"1,607건의<U+00A0>리뷰",부산 중구 남포동,29위(244곳의 부산 소재 관광지 중),"An incredible place to wander around even if you don’t end up eating any of the unbeatable fresh raw fish on offer! Lots of photo opportunities of a huge selection of fish and seafood. Worth a visit! Lots of stalls around the market area too.I call it 大家煮 in Chinese for Jalgachi. We went there around 5:30 0m so the market was not busy. The market is huge with at least 50+ seafood vendors. It could be quite confusing which vendor to choose. There are signs in the market displaying the seafood market price on some items (You won’t find one vendor offers much cheaper price. I don’t know how they compete for customers then). You can choose any seafood and amount. Each vendor works with one of the many small restaurants on the second floor. After you purchase the seafood, the vendor will call the restaurant upstairs. A server will come and take you to their restaurant upstairs where they will prepare the seafood the way you want. In additional to the price you pay to the vendor for the seafood, the restaurant only charges $4 US ($4,000 Korean won) per person for using their service which include kimchi side dishes and food preparation. Therefore, expect to pay a bit more upfront for the seafood. We spent $240 US ($240,000 won) on the seafood for six of us and we were full. We had a yellow tail which was about $110. We had it for sashimi and was delicious. We also had abalones, conches, octopus, shrimps, eels, and scallops. It is better to have a small group of people to go so you can try variety of seafood. For those who don’t know how to select seafood from the vendor, you may go directly upstairs to any of the restaurant. They have a regular menu you can order from. The restaurant will get the seafood from their vendors and cook for you. They are just as fresh. By the time we finished around 7 pm, the place was packed with people. We noticed many were local people’s this is not just a hotspot for tourists. I would say this place is the place to go for seafood in Busan.Any food creatures you ever saw a nature documentary about can be found, bought and eaten around here.Wander around this amazing fish market and see a lot of interesting creatures from the sea. And don't forget to go out the back to where there's a walkway along the water and hopefully you'll get to see the seagulls playing in the sky.One of the reason we go to Busan is to have a taste of its street seafood and this is it. There is a central covered market and around it grows and grows of fishes, eels, shrimps, octopus, conches, oysters, giant crabs...most of them alive and swimming. The view and smells are overwhelming but you get for your money. We ordered seafood meals in the covered market and they are so delicious on the grill. You should try the abalones, the squids and the big prawns.Don't go to this place unless u want to be ripped dry. They overcharged us. We paid 44000 kwon just for bbq 3 types of seafood. The seafood is bought from the fish market on first floor n cost is separate. U have to pay for rice separately n they forced u to sit on floor even though we told them my hubby had problem bending knee to sit on floor. This place ought to be investigated by the korean tourist board. The cooking bill they gave wsd initially, 32,000 won when suddenly it become 44,000 won.I have never heard of this place before and my friends that I am travelling with, one of them recommended it so we decided to go and if you love seafood go here cause not only is it a seafood market, the animals are all fresh and alive. You look at what you like and buy but they don’t give you the seafood cause they put them in bags and tell you follow them. I was confused, I was wondering where we were going. We went upstairs and it’s all tables and chairs, you guessed it they cook your seafood and serve them to you. It is sooooooo good I didn’t want to leave. So recommend this place to all seafood lovers.Whilst living in Busan for 3+ years from 2011-2015 anytime friends or family from Canada came I would take them here. You can buy nearly any fish or crustacean imaginable. I’m a big Alaskan king crab guy more than some of the korean stuff like love octopus. I find the more korean prep of seafood is very basic, or not at all (completely live octopus). The crab is amazingly good though with some soy sauce and onion and garlic stuff, and *relatively* local catch. Recommend just for the sights.Stayed in Shin Shin Hotel for 5 nights. Comfortable room with tasty breakfast. Strategic location adjacent to metro transit and many places of interest. Busan has friendly people and clean environment. We enjoyed the street food. It's a pleasant holidays for us.If you have visited Japan's Tsujiki Fish Market, give Jalgachi a miss. Drop by only if you have never visited a fish market in your life AND you have lots of spare time in your itinerary. If you do visit, wear shorts or jeans and preferably boots. Jalgachi Market is busy and colorful but the floor is perpetually wet and slippery. The stallholders vie with one another to cajole visitors to view their fish and thrust their laminated menu cards in your face. The stallholders who are not touting for customers will invariably be doing some washing and think nothing of pouring pails or basins of fishy water in a random fashion so visitors should keep a lookout and duck quickly to avoid getting your footwear and trouser legs wet.Honestly, you can get good quality, fresh seafood at most places in Busan. Jalgachi is overrated and overpriced (see photo of menu); the cooking is rough and the cooked food is just slapped onto melamine plates and put on plastic table tops. Unless you are resident Korean, chances are you will be unwittingly ripped off. Even if you do understand and speak basic Korean, you will still be outwitted by the friendly but shrewd stallholders. Be prepared to spend at least KRW50,000 per pax for a simple meal, excluding beverages. For this price, one deserves (imho) to dine in a better (and drier) environment and served neatly plated food by trained waitstaff in uniform, especially in Busan where cost of living is lower than Seoul."

I was expecting to see more related to the film festival, but instead it was mostly for shopping and eating.And stroll around in Busan central. You can find anything you e or need here. There are artists performing songs in the evening. This place has a very good vibe.Stroll and local street food. Went in the evening for dinner and enjoyed our night stroll. You can also see the celebrities hand-prints around the area.Came here for food! Nice place to hang out for shopping and food and an easy walk to Busan Tower (escalator that leads up to the park and tower)BIFF is very near to Jagalchi Market, less than 10 mins walk. If you want to shop local products, you should come here. From cosmetics to clothes to foodstuff. This place is not as nice as Myeongdong or Insadong in Seoul.The place can be crowded with all the cafes, boutique and restaurant surrounding BIFF. It’s fun place though like how you would probably enjoy myeongdong for shopping.What a wonderful venue! Its huge and very lively! Food, events, shops... Tonight they had a special performance followed by a film screening for differently abled people. This talks about how a city feels so caring and responsible towards her citizens. Bravo!!!This is the area we spent most of our time in Busan walking around, visit shops and small restaurants. The shops have good prices and are within close proximity.Each shop (even within the same chain / brand name) have different promotions, which we find unique and makes discount product digging much more interesting.The area usually starts late ~10-11am and cools down after 10pm. You can only find small food strollers after midnight.This road is located in the historic complex of Busan city. Here during the daytime saw crowded and bustling. The small central road has a car section so be careful when traveling.On the two sides of the road there are many fashion shops, coffee and food shops. The space here is very beautiful, bringing the appearance of the beach town because the sky is always blue.The majority of visitors in this square are young people. Occasionally meet some beggars. There are interesting crossroads with hand or foot marks. These marks are from famous or influential figures in Korea.Walking on the road is very safe, everyone is friendly. There are also specially designed break areas.My experience is to go to seafood market and square in 1 day because these 2 places are very close to each other.When I was here it was nothing more than an intersection filled with food stalls. I found one place with some had prints but mostly it was just food stalls all over the plaza. Only worth takign a picture when you walk pass it on your way to one of the markets."

There are lots of very cozy book shops with unique or just vintage books, like miss Oki's shop(on the picture)Very quaint. Took me about 20 minutes t slowly walk through leafing through the books - not always in English. Close to the marketI found this place online while I was planning for my trip. I was really happy to be here. Looking at people are still appreciating books. They are bookshops that do buying and selling. You name it, they (got to look around a few shops) probably have it! I also spotted mural painting and cute chairs around as well. There are also cafes around for rest too. If you love or appreciate reading through hard copy books, this is a nice place to just take a strollYou should definitely take a walk through this claustrophobic alley. There are books staked floor to ceiling, and it makes an excellent backdrop for selfies. They are almost all in Korean, but there are a few classic English novels hidden away. Just south of Book Street is a big market area.The street mainly sells second hand books, from textbooks to comics books and magazines. They are mostly in Korean but there are some English ones as well. It's more of an lane than anything and the books are neatly stacked up on top of each other like a wall. There is also a 7 storey Bookstreet cultural center, free of admission. The second and third floor are exhibitions and there is even a small cinema. Overall, a nice escape from the bustling shopping area nearby.Someone in Busan mentioned Bosu Book Street to us and we decided to have a look. It is close to other, bigger markets (Jagalchi fish market) and nice to stroll around for an hour or so. The shops in this alley are filled with mostly Korean and English books. I found it a cool, quirky place and it is interesting to see how locals try to find the book they are looking for in these gigantic piles of paper. See http://vorkintheroad.com/2014/05/16/busan-bosu-book-street/ for more photos and directions on how to get there by subway."

부산 민주공원,23건의<U+00A0>리뷰,부산 중구 영주동 산 10-16,69위(244곳의 부산 소재 관광지 중),"There are loads of photos with details from the Korean War. You can climb the steps to the monument or you can get the little lift that goes up the side (really handy). The monument is impressive and large and reminded me of a spaceship looking from underneath upwards. Really a special monument. The views are also great from the top.Democracy park is located near the busy shopping district of Nampo in Busan. This makes it a good place to go to get away from the crowds if you need a break. If you want up there it is a bit tough, depending on your route it'll probably take about an hour. There are paved and staired trails from most directions up there, or there are buses from near Jungang station (186, 86) station area and from Nampo station area (186, 86, 190). Once you're up there you can get some nice views of the harbour and the city, you can see some old locals playing a kind of Korean style chess, or you just relax and stroll around the shaded hills. It's a nice place to spend an afternoon.Beautiful views of the city, and definitely a great park unto itself. Korea paves all of their parks with the jogging rubber-like pavement that makes walking everywhere easier on the legs and feet. Went on a foggy day after it rained but it only made the views more dramatic. I only had 5 hours in Busan and thus spot would be on the top of my to-do list (along with Jagalchi Market) if you're short on time!I had been here back in 1999 and wasn't impressed. I recently went back and liked it much better. Perhaps it's because this trip was on a weekday, so there weren't the crowds that were there the first time I went. They've renovated the area around the Choong-Hon (""Loyal Dead"")Tower - it's beautiful in the fall and you get a great view of part of the city. We also went to Jungang (""Central"") Park nearby. It's a recent addition to the area (five to eight years ago) and has monuments to those who sacrificed themselves in various democratic uprisings here since the establishment of the Republic in 1948. It's a poignant reminder of how far the country has come since the end of WWII and the Korean War. There was a small museum dedicated to the various movements. It costs only about 20 cents to enter and is well done for something its size. Most of the literature is in Korean, but there are visitor's pamphlets available in English, Japanese, and Chinese. On the top of the museum building is a great place to view the cityscape and the mountains behind it. Some parts of Jungang Park seem kind of run down, though, and it was a little depressing to look over the city of Busan and see all the brand new skyscrapers and other building projects going up while this memorial to freedom fighters is overrun with weeds and feral cats (one of which had drowned in one of the pools and was just floating around). Having said that, both parks (Democracy and Central) are free and are a great place to go to take in awesome views of the city and learn a little of Korea's amazing modern history."

부평깡통시장,58건의<U+00A0>리뷰,부산 중구 중구로33번길 32 (우) 48977,56위(244곳의 부산 소재 관광지 중),"There are so many things to eat at this market. I recommend Fish cake since Busan is known for it. It's perfect for a cold winter day, sipping warm soup and eating soft fluffy fish cake. There are also many restaurant around there area, if you want crave something they will have it.This was a faintly busy night market on a warm June evening. All the cooking that was going on all around us further added to the heat load. It was nice that the street was enclosed to protect the food stalls and vendors from the rain but I wonder if the enclosed roof keeps some of the heat inside. We tried a number of different items from various food stalls but the following stood out:A vegetarian noodle dish with a drizzle of some brown sauce came from a friendly Filipina whose noodle stand was right in the middle of the street. It was a little oily but flavorful. Fish cakes from Gamasot came as plain or four cheese filled ones on their own bamboo sticks. They were placed in a cup and a ladle full of broth (used to cook the fish cakes) was poured inside. The fish cakes were chewy but the broth was richer than we expected. A side of dukboki (made of rice) was slightly spicy and chewy. This seemed to be the only food stall with seats inside, a definite plus, to get out of the street and rest for a short while. We bussed our own trash after we finished eating.Overall a very good, but tight and hot night market.Very crowded in the evening and there are lots of foods stalls.
It's a good place to try various street foods.
But, they aren't affordable. Buying 2~3 kinds of street foods will be more expensive than eating at a restaurant.This is a better shopping place than any other markets that I have visited.Better shopping experience than Myeongdong or DongdaemunPlenty of street food available here!! There is a cheap cafe before you reach the entrance... their Americano is 800won only.It's awesome with street food lover. There are so many stalls where ou can find street food not only korean food but also of so many countries here such as vietnamese foods, turkey sandwiches, chinese foods or japanese foods. And out side of Bupyeong market, you will see so many restaurents and also many stalls that serve both soju and seafood in korean way. I just got lost here last weekend. It was so much fun with friends and I was so full LOL. Don't forget visit that night market. Oups! Bupyeong Kkangtong night market open at night till 24 o'clock.One more thing, Don't forget bring cash ;)Bupyeong Kkangtong have dry and wet market sections during daytime and transformed to food street and hoft. Its within walking distance to biff, gukje market and jagalchi station on Busan Metro line 1 is the nearest station.The food here is not that expensive as i saw the sliced pork belly for 3000krw for one portion and grilled eels for 9000 per portionThe market opens at 7:30pm till midnight. So for over 4 hours, the market is filled with people eating street foods from all over the world. So many choices, all delicious, from savory to sweet. During my trip to Busan, we tried at least 2 different snacks every night.Location: 48, Bupyeong 1-gil, Jung-gu, BusanAccessibility: You may take a taxi (the most convenient) or a local busBus No: 8, 11 , 96 , 103 , 113 , 126 Kkangtong Market is just a stone's throw away from Gukje Market.A visit to both Gukje market and Kkangtong Market is a good itinerary combo when in Busan. During the Korean War, imported goods (especially US canned goods) are supplied in the Kkangtong Market thus getting a funny name (tin can market). There are lots to see such as food, clothes, foreign products, accessories, fashion items, electronic goods, jackets, etc.!Your eyes and stomach will definitely thank you when you visit this market.This is like an extension of the gukje market across the road except that this has a roof covering making this place an all weather market. 

You can find food, clothes, souvenirs, etc here."

We tried to go as many locals (not too Tourist area) as possible, but this beach linked Tourist areas and some locals. Be prepared crowded areas. It was windy and My husband told me the water was cold (he went to do the testing) and it was good to be there. Locals were nice. Tourists were there and happy relaxing.Great beach for people watching and for taking scenic photos but not for bathing. Close to restaurants and easy access using metro or the tourist bus loops.Get down at Huaendae Station and walk about 500m and you will find this lovely white sandy beach. In the autumn it is cooling and perfect to go here. Good to relax and plenty of food to eat too. Many places of interest are nearby too: Dongbaek Island & Busan Aquarium ( walking distance ), Centum City ( by taxi / train) etc.A sandy beach, hreat for passing the afternoon with friends, family or solo. There are many restaurants on the promenade next to the beach and some green parks nearby as well.A beautiful beach and so clean ! We were here in November , I can only imagine what it's like in summer.Come here for sunset and people watch, I think that’s the best time to come and enjoy the beach especially in the colder monthsIn the summer it would be packed, but in early November it was perfect for walking along the beach path. Along the path there is a tourist info office, plenty of toilets, street food and the Aquarium. On the other side of the road there are restaurants, fast food outlets, cafes etc.Nice beach. It's about 40 minutes from Busan. From Haeundae Beach, can walk to The Westin Chosun hotel where you can get to APEC Nurimaru House.It is beautifully flanked on the north side by a cluster or modern looking metallic skyscrapers which also house fine dining restaurants. There are some small islands scattered in the far side ocean and some bizarre superman or spiderman statues not too far from the shore. A little bit wacky but ok.Went for a afternoon work. It's a nice place to just chill. Not overly crowded. Was close to my hotel."

힐스파,55건의<U+00A0>리뷰,부산 해운대구 달맞이길117번길 17-7,5위(96곳의 부산 소재 스파 / 웰니스 중),"This is an excellent place to hang out and enjoy the hot water. It has a wide choice of pools and bathing areas including an outdoor area. The changing facilities and very clean and well organised and the bathing areas are generally well looked after although a little dates. It's slightly tricky to find but is behind a mall close to a subway station...about a 10-minute walk. A very Korean experience but definitely recommended. It's a big, busy place and foreigners are welcome.Our family's experience at the spa & the sauna went pretty bad from the start. At first, my sister and I couldn't help notice the tiny black substances that were floating in the cold water pool (other pools looked just fine) and so we didn't use that pool at all. The situation got even worse in the sauna. There were kids screaming & running around without any supervisions from their ill-mannered parents and the place was basically full of horny couples occupying any possible dark areas/corners to enjoy a whole lot of PDA. Lastly, the worst part of all (and the main reason that I'm writing this review) is that my allergies has gotten worse after my night at the spa yesterday. Now I feel like my time at the spa was a big waste of my money and I never want to go back there.Like many others have already stated, the location and the view from the spa are amazing. I also agree they have good amenities. However, this place needs some serious work on their sanitation and quality of service. What started as a casual weekend family night out to relax and to enjoy quality skin-care ritual really became a total nightmare. :(This place has been renovated, and changed its name to HILL SPA. I don't know how many 5 dots review pertaining to the new name jimjillbang, but according those ratings, I can confidently say, that the HILL SPA is heavily over rated, and there is much better spa in Busan close to Songdeo beach, with international crowd, and they speak English there.This is a 20 hrs spa, and 24 hrs jimjillbang that cost 1000 won/hour with a minimum payment of 12000 won, and 1000 won/ hour after that, no waiver!. So if you get to the reception at 10:05 you have to pay up till 11:00 .Keep this in mind! That is 24000 won/dayEverything is cozy all tubs and saunas having more than 6 people in them are overcrowded. The body rub fee is standard 20000 won (20 minutes) This place is frequented by Haeundae's yuppie crowd with lot of children running around virtually no visible foreigners present. So for save money on hotel to sleep there, you will find challenging to find quiet spot where no soap opera or news blasting off the TV screen, and nobody snores with implanted amplifier in their throats. This spa has nice view of the beach, and the bridge there ( not from the spa floors steamy windows), but their misleading website not listing the pricing properly on the English website.The Vesta Spa is now called The Hill Spa. Our taxi driver still knew how to get us there so the name change must not have been too long ago or taxi drivers are just used to the outdated name still being used. We took the metro to Haeundae station so we could eat dinner before heading to the Jjimjilbang for a soak and sleep. It costs 15,000\ on a weekday night, which was more than websites said when we were researching jjimjilbangs to stay. But it was still cheaper than a hostel or love motel. The place is run on a pretty specific schedule, 11pm they hand out blankets and pillows, 12midnight they turn off the lights, and 7am some of the lights come back on, but most people are already awake to watch the sunrise. The sleeping room overlooks the beach and it's amazing to wake up to that view! The soaking pools were decent, also overlooking that amazing view. We didn't use the saunas or massage services but they seemed standard. We were also expecting to have to carry money for snacks, as some websites said you had to, but everything is updated to the key/account/charge style. I think it was worth the 15,000\ for the view!The best spa by far in Busan.Super view over the bay from all floors.It was difficult for the taxi to find....but it is very close to the end of Haeundae beachThis is my favourite Jimjilbang depsite of it's old interior. You can have the best Busan night view on the top floor as well. Whenever I visit Busan this is one of the must-go place. The only word to describe it is ""Cozy"".Vesta was actually my first jimjilbang experience. It was a little tricky to find even tough I had google maps (there is an abandoned hotel closer to the water that looks sort of like this picture) and since the abandoned hotel is near the spa but the spa is higher up elevation wise, it sort of seems like google maps is pointing you to the abandoned place.It is worth the effort to find. It has views of the haeundae that are so stunning it is worth the admission price just to take in the view. They only sell beer here, which is $3 a can for Hite, slightly marked up than in town but not significantly so. I spent most of my time in the mens only area and don't consider myself much of a nude type of person. I am not in peak physical shape but felt very comfortable around the others. The reason I mention this is I read that white people tend to be looked at by Korean men out of curiosity since most white people in Korea are either there on business or there to teach english (neither category suites me) and I've read they look at your package and make people feel uncomfortable.Even though my body shape is quite different then most koreans, I did not feel anybody at any of the three jimjimbangs I visited spent even an additional second looking at me . Obviously I am out of place but aside from that it was common respect and politeness. Just don't expect much english or small talk.I ended up staying the night and sleeping in a 28c sauna. You might think, but that temps too low for a sauna, it was perfect for me.HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend a stop at Vesta. Also you can check out nearby Sharkys an awesome ex-pat bar run by some Californians. Theres a few sharkys in Busan but there is one near the Vesta Also this place has an outdoor tub, I'm not great with extreme heat be it via suana or hot tub, they ad an outdoor tub that was lukewarm in 13c weather, it was nice for a self described Canadian polar bear.Old interior but a nice set of public baths. Especially liked the jets of water which pounded against me in a nice massage. The public resting area is noisy with a lot of kids running around. The cleanliness of the water is debatable...Is a good experience as never been to a spa whereby we need to be ""naked "". Kind of weird for me but good experience. Feel good when put on the clothing whereby u need to pay 10,000won. Just spa alone will be 6000 or 8000 won (can't rem ). But the food in the small cafe is nice. Thumbs up.Never been in public bath anywhere before but this first experience is something that very unique. Mens and women's separated into different level the natural hot tub is the best. After an hours or so in the hot and cold tubs, go for the Jimjilbang. Korean way to scrub the whole body. But keep in mind that you have to be totally naked to be in this facilities."
누리마루 APEC 하우스,147건의<U+00A0>리뷰,부산 해운대구 동백로 116 (우) 48100,33위(244곳의 부산 소재 관광지 중),"The nice thing about the place is how much history it holds while also having an amazing location overlooking natural greatness. The place is really grand and nice, and you can learn about the summit as you visit. It’s also in a location that allows you to visit many other spots while visiting it, which I found very convenient and nice~I really don't get the point of this APEC house. Why don't they do something nice with the building? It's a nice building, but they kept it exactly the same as at the time of the summit. Who cares what those leaders had for dinner back then, or who sat where during the meeting? Luckily it's free.The people of Busan are clearly proud of this venue but I found it hard to get excited over a building where the leaders of APEC's twenty one members signed the Busan Declaration way back in November 2005.The House was apparently built (at great expense !), specifically for the event. At the entrance is a panel of lacquer work, inlaid with mother of pearl and showing the 12 symbol of longevity !!Its on Camilla island as you walk around Heundae beach. Free to visit, you'll walk around the displays to understand its history.The building was at the top of a path that would have been too challenging for some but the Guide did not mention this. Attractively set overlooking the sea, the building was expensive to build so it is no surprise there was discontent with the original plan to take it down after the event.Worth a visit but it is a shame there was not more information provided on historical context.Out main goal was to walk around Dongbaek park, and we visited this site along the way. It's clear that the South Korean people are proud of the role they played on the national stage for this event.This is an elegant building with Korean touches round the supporting pillars. There is a beautiful picture at the entrance and the gardens surrounding it are lovely. The diamond bridge, the longest suspension bridge in Korea can be seen from here.If you enjoy the locations where global economics are discussed you will enjoy this visit. There is a Peace Garden, Conference room for events. The best part is the Photo Gallery and the meeting rooms as they were set up for the 2005 APEC summit. Admission is free and entrance is between 9:00 and 17:00.I came across this buy chance as I was walking from the beach. Built for the 2005 APEC conference the building gives an insight into the vast expense of hosting such an event. Inside you will get the opportunity to look at the meeting room where the leaders of APEC met and you also get to see memrobilia from the meeting. You will get some great views from the building across the bay and to the lighthouse. Certainly worth a quick visit and it is free.A nice place to see, walk and breath. This is the first time I come here but I like this green and this sea so much :)"

They have outdoor and indoor areas, hot springs, 13 (!!!) themed saunas, relaxing room, restaurant, etc. I could stay all day there <U+200D>♀<U+FE0F> My favorite part was the saunas, in the entrance of each one there are Information as temperature and effects in our body. I spent more time in ""Body Sound Room"", the nature theme and meditation song really made me relax I was not able to experience (extra $$$) but they also have professional therapists in SHIM SPA (herbs, oil and stones massages) and OXYSPA. <U+270C>> You pay W15,000 (weekdays), W18,000 (weekends) and can stay for 4 HOURS! If you pass it, W3,000 per hour. If you have time in your trip so Busan, it's worth to visit and relax after a tour day. I will definitely go again!!The most outstanding feature of Spaland would be the different rooms with varying degrees of hot and one ice room with cold to relax, meditate, receive mind and body/skin therapy. You can spend about 5 minutes in each of these to try their varying effects. The only complaint is inconsiderate users who chat loudly and discruot the peace and harmony but the administration conducts checks at stipulated times so they are aware of this.The onsen is good too except you must also shampoo your hair before going into their mainly sodium chloride heated pools so make sure it's your washing hair do before you go. Apart from this strictly enforced regulation, everything else is wonderful. The locker system(separate for shoes and clothes, bags) works efficiently and after your soak in the pools, you can use their body lotion and serums, drink warm/cold water and use the rest of the facilities, most free like the rooms (including relax room with TV) but chargeable for massage machines, snacks (the quintessential hardboiled eggs from Korean drama)!There are cafes and restaurants, separate spas of commercial brands, cosmetics and health are products in the entire building. You can spend your 4 hours happily here (early bird discounted rates for morning and late night sessions) ending probably with the outdoor footbaths where topcoats are thoughtfully provided for colder weather.The seafood soy soup is great. Variety of seafood, abalone, half crab, prawn, clams and mussel. Very reasonable considering it only cost 10000 won.Good place to experience Korean Spa. Its location is easily accessible by subway. But the staff at reception sucks with lousy atiitude.Really well done Jimjilbang (Korean Spa) experience. If you've never done one (like Wi Spa in LA) it really is worth it. Keep in mind you will need to be fully naked and showered to enter their excellent hot baths. But the best part is the area where you wear the pantaloons and shirt they provide and can enjoy the hot rooms that are peacefully coed. No nudity there.This spa was definitely the best Spa I have visited. It was extremely clean and many different options of different pools to try. The only thing that was not open when I visited was the outside baths, even more of s reason to return. Overall a fab place to relax and unwind, can highly recommend the scrub too!!It took about 20 minutes by taxi from busanjin market to here. There is direct train from here to seomyeon busan station when we finished shopping. So it is easy to get here by train too.We took taxi at busanjin cos we were not near any station and did not know how to get here from the market. So taxi was ok. The mall sells high end clothing, bags, etc. All international as well as local brands.The best park is the basement where it has many food stores. Just incredible. Most stores were korean, Japanese, Chinese, Western items. Unlike here we get really international food. We love the snacks like seoul roll, fish cakes, etc. You buy them then go into the marketplace (supermarket) to eat. There are some stores inside this marketplace selling korean delicacies.Then take one floor down you see a fashion street, mainly korean style.Then go yo 3rd floor to connect to centum city which is anotger smaller shopping mall. It has on ground floor selling discounted high end fashion like Kenzo, Burberry but still expensive after the discount like sin$800 and above.Undoubtedly the best place in the city to relax your mind. It is clean, well maintained. Best time to visit during winter. Quite expensive though but worth every pennyMy partner and I really enjoyed this spa in Busan. The location was centrally located, and the spa was very clean. Most of the staff could speak English and/or there were English signs explaining what to do if you've never been to a Korean spa before. We enjoyed the separate pools, and the areas open to both sexes, too. Plus, the smoothies in the cafe were delicious!I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Busan.This spa is super clean and super large !I came here on rainny day which was perfect spa day. I spent 4 hours that was given for maximum stay. I would come back again."
송정 해수욕장,138건의<U+00A0>리뷰,부산 해운대구 송정동 712-2,28위(244곳의 부산 소재 관광지 중),"Randomly booked Hotel Laon and when I arrived and initially saw the view from my hotel room, a smile spread across my face. What a view of such a pretty beach. This is what you call a secluded beach especially visiting this beach during the off peak season. Every morning you would see a handful of surfers catching the waves. Waking up to see the sunrise was amazing. This beach is served by the over ground train and can be a trek to go to see some of the sights in busan but is nearby to via the overground and subway station to Haeundae beach which is the more popular beach. Ten minute walk to the closest train station. And a minute walk from Hotel Laon was this place that did fabulous french toast. All in all I was a happy bunny.We stayed at Hotel Carib, which gave us a perfect view of the many surfers who were out doing their thing every day....I loved it! True, it's maybe not the best place for really swimming, but for a great view and just dipping your toes in the sea, you really can't beat it!While Australian tourists might be underwhelmed by the wave sizes in Korea, Songjeong is a beautiful beach in its own right and the best for breaking waves on a windy day! Picturesque best describes the view on a blue sky day. Well worth a stop if you are heading north to Haedong Yonggung Temple.Song Jeong is an awesome spot, especially early in the morning. My favorite beach in Busan to visit especially when the sun is rising. It's quiet and the few surfers out there are having a great time. During the day, the traffic gets heavier so parking takes time, but there's food stalls, surf shops, coffee shops, seafood and the beach to make up for that inconvenience. Definitely recommended as a tour / hang out spot.Good hotels, good cafes at the beach and good and inexpensive restaurants in the neigbourhood. The beach is much less crowded than Heaundae and quite pleasant for sleeping or having fun with little kids.But the rule on guarded beaches in Busan is no swimming beyond buoys that are chest-deep during the high tide and below-the-waist deep during the low tide, so you basically cannot go more than ca 30 meters away from the shore. It's strongly enforced by many lifeguards, you hear their whistles almost permanently. After swimming there and back again and again along the buoys, constantly pestered by the lifeguards, because you're too near to them and kicking the sand in shallow water, you'll get annoyed soon.It is also prohibited to enter the water after 6 PM. Not to swim, they'll kick you out when you're walking knee-deep along the shore.And that surely weren't bad weather rules, those rules apply all the time.If you want to have fun in the sea, just don't go to Busan beaches. They won't let you have it.Here is a more quiet beach and beautiful as you expect it to be on a weekend getaway.Sunny day needed to see the beauty of the water and sand tho.I was there on a Sunday/Monday, and it was not crowded at all.its a surfer beach but dont expect waves, that's for beginners.Its still quiet at night, couples and family are coming Some good seafood restaurants, cheap and great hotel (I recommend Songjeong Marina Resort) nice view of the beach.The sunrise at the hotel was breathtaking.If you spend 2 nights there, I can assure you that you would feel disconnected.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for at least a night as it is far from everything else but its worth itI will come back for sure someday !I come from a country that has many vast natural beautiful beaches, so this looks small but well maintained with many facilities for the beach goer. Overall, there is nothing special about it.The beach is great for swimming during the summer months, and it is full of places to eat and dine and have coffee with friends all year around. It is very open sea beach, so you feel nature around, and surrounded by buildings where all sercvices are provided. So close to Busan and as good as the city.Nice quiet beach (off season) to enjoy the sea breeze and watch the surfers . Surfers are out there any time of the year and there are some small coffee shop to relax . Worth the visit as this is only a 10-15 mins drive from Haeundae beach . Highly recommended for people who like more natural surroundings .A beautiful place ruined by weekend beach goers leaving their rubbish. Lovely walks at the temple hill end. Lovely old ladies selling their home grown greens early in the morning in the street. Nice places to eat near the reserve road off the beach."

We couldn’t go in to the APEC House, but the walkway to the House and back is very scenic with lots of nice views. It is an easy walk.Nice walk where you could enjoy some sculptures. Not much to see. Could easily do this in 1hrs. But a nice free activity.Gardens and position on the coast make this a serene and beautiful place for time out from the city hustle and bustle. Very Pleasant Place.I had I great walk from Park Hyatt about 10 minutes.Nice place to see,a beautiful park around ,all the way to Haeundae Beach.This is a great place for a hike, walk or a place to take a photo.  The museum is a pretty cool attraction z to boot!!Visited here on a beautiful and warm fall weekday. The park is a beautiful place with wonderful views of the city skyline, the bridge, the beach, and the sea. Not many people here when I visited which gave it a calm feeling. I imagine it is quite busy on the weekend and in the high season. The APEC building is really cool too. Definitely a place to visit.Beautiful park by the beach. Need some stamina to walk up and around the park due to its lush ground . Place was clean and well kept. APEC house was historical. The lighthouse was great. Took many beautiful photos.Nice spot , nice surroundigs , with a historic background.Nice view but you miss nothing if you do not go to that placeThe park is really an attractive one, but not a great one. It is large and easy to walk (however, it can be too long for any in your group with mobility issues) in an hour or so. The key attraction is the APEC building--a well designed and interesting structure from the outside. The inside tour is OK, but not informative as one would like. It is a bit too ""touristy"" for us.The water and city views are beautiful. The architecture of the city is OUTSTANDING. It is hard to believe that they have as many great buildings as they have. The views form the park really show them off to grab your attention. There are lots of photo opportunities.To sum it up, we would not do this again, but it is a good trip to have a nice ""walk in the park"" along with some great views of the city--as well as the water. Once is enough!Building not of special interest unless you are history buff but nice walks around and views of beach. Not to go out of way for."

신세계 백화점 센텀시티,407건의<U+00A0>리뷰,부산 해운대구 우동 1495,22위(244곳의 부산 소재 관광지 중),"As the largest shopping mall in the world it's huge, sparkling clean and upmarket with designer outfits and accessories but moderate-priced in the restaurants on the 9th floor and the Food Hall in the basement.We had lunch at the traditional restaurant Gaejung, ordered the Jeonju style bibimbap and the seafood stew with soft tofu. Delicious, kind and warm service, value for money. There 's even a water dispenser near the lifts in this super-store.There' s a kind of Jurasic Park for children on the 9th floor before you come to the restaurants.Worth a few visits even if you're not a real shopper, you can get organic fruits and vegetables in the supermarket and try the lovely snack foods, skewers of meat, fishcakes, nut chips, buns and bakery goods which all look appetising and well-prepared. The cafes offer gourmet coffee and innovatjve dishes, Western as well as Korean.It was suggested by the hotel staff to go check out this gigantic department store. It's very well kept. The 9th floor park is a great place. The view is awesome. Unfortunately I couldn't find any halal products or food here.Super clean, modern and exclusive shops. everyone was so friendly and helpful. Plenty of parking easy to get access.Our tour guide took us to this Mall for lunch and then a walk through some of the the duty free shops. I’m almost sure we went up at least 5 sets of escalators and we could still see more ahead. Our lunch was at a buffet restaurant and the food did not disappoint. The few stores we visited were all priced like home. I liked the cleanliness and open atmosphere of the place, but merchandise wise, it is not worth struggling with extra luggage, when you can get the same items at home. Just checked off as having visited one of the largest shopping malls.Supposedly the World's Largest Department Store...well it is big and has a lot of stores, movie theater, ice skating rink, etc. Why would you come here? To see a big place with a lot of people. Again, a lot of people so only come here if you really need to go shopping. Otherwise, the best part is the food court in the basement with a ton of different cuisines and desserts.We grabbed a bite for lunch at the counter of a noodle spot and tried to copy the locals. Great experience and great lunch. Had a quick tour around the mall- saw the Guiness Book of World Records certificate, went on the escalators, got a Starbucks Busan mug and checked out the skating rink. Neat spot for a quick lunch and visit- I wouldn't spend too much time here as a tourist.So huge and nice with many choices to shop and even nice to walk around in there! Even has a nice vr experience that you should definitely try!~Huge Department Store, very easy to reach by underground train, staff friendly and helpful, but unless you are a Designer fan and prepared to pay the exorbant prices at one of the many Designer stores, you are out of luck. The selection of non-designer clothes, shoes, etc. are very uninspiring, floor upon floor of the exact same clothes, very boring and dissapointing. The Food Court is ok, the Ice Rink nice to see, the Cinema absolutely modern, these are the best things about the place. Not worth a second visit.This was a ridiculously large shopping mall. I know of no other mall that packs all the following into one building: a rooftop playground (known as Zooraji) filled with dinosaurs statues and playground structures, a golf driving range, an ice rink, a massive spa complex (Spaland) and tons of shopping.Besides the above, the downstairs basement floors contained the food market (consisting of another very large assortment of food and drinks) and a pharmacy.For all the people in the mall that day, the staff do a very good job maintaining the displays and the overall condition of the building. Prices in general were a bit on the pricey side so we just window shopped.The Guinness Book of World Records certificate was located next to the main information desk on the first floor.Overall a good place to keep anyone in the family occupied or entertained.This is review is specifically for the restaurant DimDimSum upstairs (not in the downstairs food court). There were a few restaurants upstairs (Korean, Chinese, Japanese and possibly Italian?) and it was much more relaxed and quiet up there than in the food court madhouse. We ordered dim sum with shrimp & scallop, shrimp, duck with choi sum and noodles, and stuffed eggplant. Everything was scrumptious and the staff were very kind and polite. Afterward we ventured downstairs and were ecstatic to find Kinotoya Cheese Tarts in the food court. They also had them in the Lotte Department Store in Myeongdong. Yay!"

약천사,227건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서귀포 대포동 1165 (우) 697-320,6위(118곳의 서귀포 소재 관광지 중),"It was not on our itinerary but our driver suggested to stop for a visit as we were passing by.It was a pleasant surprise since we had no expectations for this place. Beautiful temple with nice views of the sea. If we had time, we would attempt a hike from the temple as it is the beginning of an Olle trail.Yakcheonsa Temple is a famous Buddhist Templet located in Jeju island south of mainland Korea. The temple was built in 1981 by a Buddhist monk . It has three floors It has a large Buddhist prayer hall. It is also famous for housing, 80,000 Buddhas all located on the second floor encased in glass. It also has smaller statue of Buddha surrounded by lotus flowers under a pair of intricately carved, protective dragons. The view from the top floor is veryy beaytiful facing the seaOne of the checklist in Jeju, It is free and beautiful spot to take picture. You should definitely visitNice gardens, impressive location, however, normally a lot of people, busloads full. So it is preferable there early in the morning or late in the afternoon.A beautiful Temple which is in a serene location. With virtually any tourist to be seen, I could enjoy the calm and peace the place had to offer. The temple itself is a huge structure and very well maintained.While visiting a friend who works in Jeju, my family drove around to visit places casually with a flexible schedule. We planned to visit the temple for half an hour but stayed more than an hour. The name of the temple means medical spring and the flowing water from a 3-dragon-head fountain next to the temple store tasted good and sweet. Although the temple was built for only around 20 years, the buildings and layout followed the traditional design. The main building faces exact south that can view the sea. The bell tower is located in the east for sunrise and the drum tower is located in the west for sunset. The main building's first floor wooden windows are beautifully carved with inspiring stories covered by traditional white paper but not glass. There is a traditional Korean painting exhibition of Buddha of Compassion in the basement and it's gorgeous. The best part of our visit was that not many people around. We got the chance to enjoy the quietness and even used the mats inside the temple at the back of the first floor to meditate a short while. There are grapefruit trees in the yards along the way to bathroom.One of the larger temples we visited in Jeju. Beautiful well tended grounds and architecture. There is a bus stop right outside the temple which is handy!When we went, no tourists where there. It was a magical experience, I definitely recommend it. You should sit on the stairs, outside the temple, listen to the buddhist praying, and enjoy the moment.A beautiful architecture Buddhist Temple. Surrounded by tangerines trees. Come and see for yourself. =)Temple is nice design and along our walk, we found many tangerines tree which I believe during the spring season, the temple view will be good. Since It's FOC do drop by if you have time. It's along the way to Teddy Bear Museum and Cheonjeyon Fall, Yeomiji Botanical Garden"
중문 색달 해변,167건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서귀포 산록남로,14위(118곳의 서귀포 소재 관광지 중),"This beach is recommended by all as a ""best beach on Jeju"".I'm disagree, mostly absolutely.The Jungmun is perfect and ideal and best beach on Jeju for surfers only! And there are pretty overcrowded by them even in September. Waves are good there for beginners and middle surfers (at the moment I've been there).For swimming and relaxing is better to choose other beaches, for example Hyeopjae Beach and few other.Jeju has many beautiful beaches and Jungmun is definitely one of them! Great place to see huge waves and surfers in action. You can go up to the cliff top for that aerial view of the beach.We stayed at Benikea Jungmun Hotelon not very far walking distance from this beach. In the early morning or late afternoon are especially the best time to enjoy the beach, not very crowded during these times of the day. There's a special section for swimmers, however it's not too small. There is a changing a showering conveniently close, it is just beside the beach so that made it easy to prepare, and have a shower after the swim. An amazing beach!!We stayed in a resort on walking distance from this beach. Especially early in the morning the waves are good. Quite a bunch of surf school offer lessons and boards for hire. There's a special section for swimmers, however this is much too small.Everything ok here, except swimming is confined to a narrow area to the side, where are the swimmers are squeezed into a small area.Small, but great little beach. We didn't get much time here as we were on a tight schedule for our business trip, but we had enough time for a half hour swim. There were many surfers and the water was perfect. There were many people at the beach but it was not crowded. The beach slopes very gently into the ocean, so even 20, 30 feet out you're barely to your shoulders. Nice low waves, so a great place to just chill and have a leisurely swim. There was a changing/showering place conveniently just beside the beach so that made it easy to change and be ready to go again. Lovely little spot.My return to Jungmun, after almost seventeen years, revealed that not much had changed. This is not surprising, as the main draw of the place is its steep and jagged volcanic rock formations. The Hyatt Regency and other resort amenities were there in the 1980's, when we lived on Jeju. The concessions at beachside are still the charming ""Mom and Pop"" establishments, serving ice cream and Korean pastries, plus Yogurt beverages.Favourite surf spot in KoreaFriendly people and nice vibes on the beachBeautiful sunset and chill all day long, also the cliffs are fabulous SURFERS are great !I would not go out of my way to try to swim here. But it is pretty and interesting next to the cliff. Water, bathrooms, and other services not available when we were there but it was off season so maybe there's something there during the summer. The stairs up the cliff will kick your butt.Before flying to Jeju-do (island) many of my friends suggested me to do a one day jeju tour that completes the island in one day. But I'm the type of person to enjoy my vacation slowly. Although, the island is not that big, I wanted to enjoy every bit and detail of the island. I choose to focus on one area at a time. Three months before my trip I researched top 5 beaches in Jeju. After researching, I decided my hotel and location place where to spend my vacation. I choose Seogwipo, end of Jeju. The hotel I stayed in was Grand Mer Hotel. I stayed 3 nights there, it was a new hotel and the best part was it was across the ocean. You can wake up to the view of the Jungmun beach. Which was listed top beach in Jeju. It's a little far out so you'll need to rent a car. Shopping and museums and hiking was 10 mins drive away. But the view was spectacular and my morning walk was so refreshing. If your ever in Seogwipo you have to try Hawaiian Shrimp restaurant which was 15 mins away from my hotel"
한라산 국립공원,"1,050건의<U+00A0>리뷰",서귀포 상효동 산220-1,2위(118곳의 서귀포 소재 관광지 중),"We went to Hallasan NP in early November by ourselves. It’s quite easy to take the bus to the park. Just make sure you know which stop to get off as there are several entrances. We decided to hike the shortest trail (1.3km). It begins at the Hallasan National Park Visitor Centre and finishes atop Eoseungtaeng Oreum, with sweeping views of the Jeju plains and the peak of Hallasan. The leaves are very beautiful along the trail. With our age, being seniors, and photo stops, it took us one hour to get up to the top. Definitely it worths the hike!Our visit was postponed for a day but it was worth the wait. There was a heavy snowstorm a couple of days prior and the roads to Hallasan National Park were closed. When access to the park was restored, a beautiful blanket of snow was awaiting.It was my first experience of snow and I loved it. I came from a tropical country (where the coldest temperature ever recorded was at 6 degrees Celsius) so experiencing snow is a surreal experience. Although we did not climb any trail to the summit, experiencing snow even just outside the Visitor Center was fun and pleasurable. The Jeju Snow Festival for 2018-2019 did not include the Visitor Center at Hallasan National Park, however, unlike the previous year so there were no attractions set up in the area.Because of this, I am going back to South Korea this coming December for another winter wonderland experience and to try out skiing.An UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and a World Heritage Site, the Hallasan National Park is loaded with walking trails and is home to South Korea’s highest mountain named the Shield Volcano Hallasan. You’ll find about 1800 different kinds of plants and a number of alpine animals along the way up. The park is a unique place for nature lovers. Settled right in the heart of Jeju island, this park with high density woods and blooming hillsides is concidered as a treat to be at. Transportation: start with chosing a right trail for you. There many different ways up to the mountain, but only one of them will bring you to the summit. To get to the entrance you’d probably need to take one of the public busses or rent a car. Both options are convenient. Equipment: You’d definitely need to be prepared for a long and tiring walk. All the trails are devided into segments, based on their difficulty. Some of the parts of the trail would be paved, some wouldn’t be equipped at all. You’d be grateful for those parts where you’d be able to walk and step on the wooden bridges and paths. But except those short and the easiest parts of the way, you’d need to climb on the steep and narrow rocks, hop along cobblestones and boulders. Timing: don’t rush, remember when you’re on the top, that was only a half of your journey. There is the same long way down the mountain when you’re on the summit. Tips: be prepared for considerable change of the temperature and other weather conditions. We started in a pleasant sunny day and finished when it was drizzling and the fog was literally embracing us. Add up some wind and decreased temperature and you’re almost in our shoes out there. You’d definetely need to wear tracking boots or something alike, protecting and supporting your feet well. Otherwise you risk hurting your ankles and knees. (as us, cause we were not prepared)You’d also want to change your clothes after 6-7 hours tracking up and down this mountain. Believe me you’ll be sweating af.If there is only one thing I can do during my travel in Jeju, it would be hiking at the Hallasan National Park. There were just 2 trails (Seongpanak & Gwaneumsa, where Seongpanak was easier) which can reach the top of the mountain, where you can see the Baengnokdam. You can even get a certificate (which costs only KRW1000) of climbing the Hallasan if you show the staff at the tourist centre your picture with Baengnokdam.A difficult one if you choose to do the longest one which takes 4.5 hrs up and 4 hrs down.We went up the Eorimok trail which took us 2 n half hours up..its not an easy trak with steps and rocky path but the track has been laid with a lot of effort.In autumn the trees start to turn their colours .We came down the yeongsil trail which took us one hour to come down with spectac views..its an easier way to climb down than to climb up the yongsil trail.Bus 240 goes and come back at both stops with the entrance name as the stop names.But while from Eiromok entrance it's just a 10 mins walk up to the start of the trail.....its 45 mins walk to walk to the yeongsil entrance bus stop to the start of the trail.There are no tkts entrance for the hikes,but if you have rented a car then there is a parking fees.Carry some food to eat and energy bars and water n juice.We took one walk here. Vertical rise of about 200m through nature. A couple of hours of hiking & stopping to view the plants & birds. Great view of the crater from the top. Worth the trek. Carry lots of water if it hot!There are several trials to explore and because of time limitation, have chosen the shortest one and the hike of 2.5 hours is rewarding. Air is fresh and can image the autumn maple leaves will be wonderful.I took the eorimok trail which took about 2.5 hours to get to the top with the rest rooms, the first part of the trek is hard work and quite strenuous. After reaching the top I took the yeongsil trail back down which had some of the most stunning views along the way. As I came by bus the walk down from the yeongsil trail to the yeongsil ticket office where the bus stop is located takes another 40minuts or so depending on the pace. I Would highly recommend visiting this area and trying the trails.Took the longest trail to Mount Hallasan peak (Seongpanak Trail) - 9.6 km - but started a bit late and did not make the cut-off time at the Jindalrae shelter (7km). However it was a great walk and I visited the Saraoream peak on a side tril on the way back. This was well worth it as there is great view and also a beautiful crater lake. It is key that you start early and take enough water with you. Also need good shoes. Although it was August - most of the trail is in the forest - so not so hot.choose to get up by soegpanak trail and down by another trail， Gwaneumsa, which much more harder and shorter. Manage to complete the hiking for 7 hours"

용머리 해안,223건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서귀포 안덕면 사계리 181-1,3위(118곳의 서귀포 소재 관광지 중),"We had a wonderful time, enjoying the beautiful rock formations. Great place to take pretty photos. The climb down on the rocky rocks can be a challenge but the reward is well worth it. Some ahjumas are selling their catch of fresh seafood too. Place may be closed if it is high tide.If you are on the west end of the island you should definitely see this wonderful place. And, if you are lucky enough to see a few 'women divers' selling their fresh seafood (and you have a stomach for unusual and raw seafood) you should try this unusual treat. They will also sell you a shot of Suju if you need it!Visited on 19th October 2019.Check before departing because it's often close due to high tide.Unforgettable experience there with stunning spot to take photo.A must visit. Enjoy!!Pretty interesting coastal erosion processes and fantastic landforms. This is a relatively easy short walk along the coast. Be careful, however, if you're bringing kids or elderly person - the rock trail can get rather slippery and some parts will see you getting very close to the sea and waves.Great scenic spot with narrow shelf or rock at the base of cliffs which were part of an old volcano. We visited on a day of high wind and rough seas and the site was closed as the path was too dangerous. was able to visit the climate exhibition centre and see the model of the Dutch Ship De Sperwer wrecked hundreds of years ago. Also took the walk up the hill to the beacon tower.It's a beautiful place for you to admire the view and take IG photo. If you're good in photo shooting, you might be able to trick people that you're in Grand Canyon.Really enjoyed the walk around the coastal, all the rock formation is awesome. We walked around from the shipwreck and back again to the same spot. If you love nature, this place is a must.Just a dead volcano mount. Nothing special. Weather there i good for rest. Maybe good place to view sunriseOdd yet beautiful layers of rock formation. Frequent beating of waves and wind carve a character into the coast. Including the side profile of a crying man. Perhaps our fav spot throughout our stay.There was nothing much to see here and we got pretty bored almost as soon as we got there. Go elsewhere with more stuff to see/do when you're in Jeju."

First, it tries to make its own characters seems as popular as Mickey Mouse and Spider Man - it doesn’t work but it’s great fun just trying to figure out who is who. Second, everything seems brand new - so it’s spotless and at the same standards as a Disneyland or Universal Studios. Third - the rides are small but oh so knock out fun. And there is rarely anyone there. I don’t know if they sell a fast pass but there is no need for one because i don’t ever imagine it getting that crowded. The food was quite delicious, too - great offerings at multiple locations. You can easily do this park in a half day and not feel like your exhausted or missing anything. Like everything in Jeju, I think they think they are expanding but who knows.. and as i remember, the entry price is super affordable. So, this is really a great time for anyone with kids or who enjoys theme parks. Don’t go in thinking it’s Disneyland, though, and get picky - just enjoy it for what it is...a bold effort to start something special and first class and doing very well right from the start. It was a great day for me and my daughter and her two cousins. Enjoy!Nice place for young kids is best. Not really good for adults but it was cute......will try water park next time.This is a hood visit in Jeju.Our family visit jeju in June 2019.We visit jeju city for three days , then go to Shinhwa world for another days.Hello, went there on a family trip with our small kids on children's day. Overall ok, not so crowed as expected, nice park and arrangement. However here some points which should be improved:1. Ticket price is 39.000 KRW for adult and 29.000 KRW, which is too high for what is offered (still construction ongoing). Price should be reduced during construction time to attract more tourist. There should be family tickets with reduced price. 2. Bump Tube Car in New Oscar World. Its not mentioned on the map/guide and even worst its not free! You have to pay extra 5.000 KRW for adult (any maybe even more for kids) but nobody explained to you, nothing was mentioned on a board. When you think you can take the tube car, the staff ask for your ticket. So you wait 15 min, then have to buy a ticket and line up again. Poor communication and every parents were very angry but had to pay because their child already lined up and wanted to take trip tube car. Very clever from the management. Why there is a need to pay for this attraction, it should be included in entrance fee as this is already very high. 3. Helium balloon price is 13.000 KRW, which is already 1/3 of entrance fee, which is too expensive for a simply balloon. Should be less than 9.000 KRW at least. 4. The worst, all the food where sold out in Food Court. Can happen, but all food? We asked to call the other cafeteria and ask what kind of food they still have. They still had one food where we had to run to get it. We also asked what will happen if there is no food, but the staff could not answer. Later we had to eat at the snack corner where as along cue and you had ti wait 20 min to get something. 5. Shuttle bus frequency to parking lot F shall be at least doubled, currently one but and you have to wait again in the cue for 15 min. 6. Before you decide to go there with your kids, you should check witch attractions your child can take. There are some restrictions on children's height (good due for safety reasons). Sorry, the park might be nice.I visited this place in January 2018. I traveled alone so I decided not to get into the theme park. I just take pictures in front of the entrance, but I feel that this theme park is very exciting. I'd love to play when I come again in the future. Access to this place is accessible by bus/taxi. This place is still not crowded by tourists, probably because this place has just opened and many tourists don't really know the whereabouts of this place.Our first time in Shinhwa World theme park visit in December 2017. One must come with the understanding that the theme park is not yet fully developed but it has some nice rides and you can spend a few hours there . My kids had a wonderful time . Since it is new , the park is not crowded. We had lunch at the food court and it was good Korean food . We were initially disappointed when the rides were suspended due to the snow. However the rides were resumed quickly after the snow stopped. We happened to have met the theme park Manager Mr Mason Kang when we ran into communication difficulty with one of the staff attending to the ride . He was very kind to explain to us that the rides would resume soon after they dry the area . His professionalism impressed us . Our theme park experience was a great one . My kids tried the ice skating ring within the theme park compound . Everything is new and clean . We will come again ! They are going to have a Water theme park probably year after .My 10 yo daughter and I came here on a Monday in December. There was hardly anyone in the park which meant no waits. Park is small but fun rides. We stayed about 3 hours did everything and some rides multiple times.Park is a little small but has some fun rides. Very clean and new. Great staff. Good food (except for pizza).I was lucky enough to be given the first hand visit to a mega tourist attraction project open progressively in September 2017. The Jeju Shinhwa World , is the first premium resort in Jeju Island. It's really a resort for everyone . With different choices of hotels catering for all ages. It's just so enticing that I hope I don't need to wait that long but ....everything here is done to perfection. There will be 7 theme parks(three of these theme with TUBAn),4 hotels , villas ,Asian Food street, YG Town all these within this 2.5 million square feet . It is really going to be so much fun staying here, the happening place. I only have time to snap photos on the theme park. Sooooooo excited to go back again to have fun in this Resort."

한강 공원,"1,554건의<U+00A0>리뷰",서울,12위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"There are some walking distance (at least 10mins) to reach the park if you ride there by bus or metro. That is why some local cycling there to save time and evergy.There are food festival during weekend, however till month Oct only, maybe due to weather. During night time, there can be very cool because of strong wind. No worry about food if you going during weekend (please check it out the status first, night close due to changes of weather). Overall, is a great experiences.You can start anywhere along the Han river and cycle south all the way to Busan, almsot entirely on bike paths. There are concerts and other events on weekends at various places, like Banpo or Yeoido. Many people bring tents and order food at the park.I visited this park because I was missing a ´local´ experience. Though I love Seoul and especially all the historical sites, I wanted to see what locals do in this town. It was recommended by a business contact of mine when I asked him why there is almost no movement at all on the Han river and he explained to me that almost all transportation of goods happens over land so the river isn´t really used a lot. What people do, is visit and look at the river, enjoy it´s wide open space while it cuts through Seoul. The place to experience this is the Hangang park (metro Yeouinaru), where especially on friday afternoon thousands of Corean youth gather and have picnics, meet with friends or with a date and just sit and talk. The Hangang park is really wide and stretched along side the river bank, so you can stroll for hours, rent a bike, buy some food at the foodtrucks and watch people have a great time. I recommend you to buy food, some beers or sodas, a blanket and have a picnic before going on a stroll!As a bonus you will have an amazing background scenery of (one of the) Seoul skylines.Hangang Park has been a very popular shooting location for KDrama scenes. It feels good to be able to step on the ground where KStars also walked on hahaha :DThe Hangang-Park is a beautiful place to be. Where you can have a walk or jogging around or sit there for a beer and chicken, which you can order right to the spot you are sitting. It is awesome!Nice enough, and we rented bikes for a lovely afternoon. Services are limited, so pack food or go in the evening when the food trucks are open. Prepare for the crowds.Great place for a good time! So many activities you can do regardless of who you're travelling with. We visited several times during our stay, during which we tried one of the night time river cruises, had a picnic another day, and came for a night walk the last one (so many great food trucks here!). You can take the metro to Yeouido.Its summer time. Weather still nice in June. Not so hot. Not so cold. Just nice for picnic with family and couples. Lots of food truck to choice for food .Can rent a bike and ride along the river bank. Surely will come again for the sunset view.A Park where you can Relax and stay positive :) this is a great place to meditate and think about life. Experience picnic like a local here just bring your blanket and you are ready to go. And it is place for taking a picture :). and just be mesmerized at the view of Hangang river and Cruise. and in addition if you want to cruise there is a mini cruise at that park on Hangang River and experience the romantic view with your love one :)If you are in company eveb better: nice walk, nice cycling and on fridays and saturdays there are food trucks with music show, nice but don't expect too much"

KTX,"1,037건의<U+00A0>리뷰",서울,9위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"Great counter staff who assisted me even when I asked them which public wifi spot I could tap on, and they got us the front facing seats we wanted. The ride was super comfortable and toilets are decently clean. Definitely will take it again as it is a more convenient alternative to taking airplanes within korea.Wow! Talk about efficient! We purchased tickets online to guarantee a seat and exchanged it at Seoul Station for printed tickets. Takes 2 hours to get to Gyeongju (seriously beautiful, btw) and the ride was smooth and comfortable. Our tour in Gyeongju ended a little earlier than anticipated and we were not able to get an earlier ride back to Seoul, they were sold out. We just chilled at Sin Gyeongju station. There's some shops and a couple of restaurants. KTX is awesome!Great system for the price and quite fast as most have already noted.Also connected to major metro stations for easy access to subways.The average speed is about 300km/h or more between Seoul and Busan.However, there is always a strange slowdown around Sejong City.Probably would cut travel time by ~15m if this slowdown doesn't happen.Fast, clean and efficient way to travel in Korea. Seoul to Daegu is about 2 hours. On a busy weekend, you might want to get a ticket in advance, or else you might end up with standing room only, which means standing in the area between the cars near the bathroom - not a fun way to spend a few hours.Easy to find the train and the train is clean and the seat is comfortable.Ready your tickets early as i can see the train is fully booked.The ticket is not cheap but for me is an experience because of the movie - Train to Busan.KTX is the best way to travel long distances in Korea. Its better than by air as it leaves from the middle of Seoul and lands in the middle of your destination in the city you are visiting. Very comfortable and free wi fi. Ideal if travelling to BusanWe bought the KR Pass, 4-day flexible pass. You can book one month in advance in their website.Went to Busan, Daegu, Daejeon and back to Seoul.It convenient, hassle-free and fast.Traveling with KTX train is always one of my favorite public transport to Busan/Gyeongju and etc, Pros:- The train seating for second class is comfortable, and clean. Staff over the counter is helpful, as i need to change earlier train schedule from Pohang to Busan to avoid long waiting inside the station. They manage to help me change without any problem on the day itself.Seoul airport is easy to get around. The automatic ticket machines are easy to use but there is a ticket desk near the entrance if you need help. It’s a quick trip into the city and you pay more for reserved seats. I used this service for my first trip and used the standard service for my other 3 trips.My guess very cheep, in Japan 3-4 times more.also,much easy to use than metro in Korea.In Seoul is for me is nuts."

반포대교,261건의<U+00A0>리뷰,"서울 350 Dongjak-daero, Banpobon-dong, Seocho-gu Moonlight Rainbow Fountain (우) 06500",118위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"Quite a distance walking from express bus terminal metro station, anyway it is worth it watching the light shower where water jets coming out from side of the bridge. The timing of shows are 7.30pm, 8pm, 8.30pm, 9pm. Each show lasts around 20mins. There are some food stalls nearby where you can get a quick snack. Restaurants and cafes are also available.If you want to get a better view of the entire Banpo bridge go to the hanging cafe on the Dongjak bridge, you will see steams of colored water. If you want to see it up close, take the #9 line and exit at the express bus terminal, follow the signs and you will walk about 20 minutes along Banpo-daero until you find the entrance to go under the bridge, follow the signs that say floating island and walk another 10 minutes to Banpo Hangang Park. Make sure to check for schedule of shows. When we went there there were only 3 20 minute shows starting at 8 pm every 1/2 hour. From here you can walk to the man-made floating islands to watch the colorless steams of water and the bright colored lights underneath. I recommend 1 to 2 hours mostly because it takes time to get there.I loved this area! Went on a Friday night, watched the show which was very relaxing! Then walked over through all the other buildings, and a night market with food trucks! I think its worth seeing, and ita free!Nice parc, perfect for strolls. At night, the bridge has a light show. It just misses music but it’s a nice show. It’s best to see it when it is really dark.The light show was quite average and certainly not worth the 30 minute bus journey we took to get there. It was not really a ‘show’ but just coloured lights on the side of the bridge.Definitely worth going to if you’re in walking distance but not worth going to if you have a longer journey.Good times don’t need to be expensive. Come here for a night out. Bring a friend along. Sit down on the stairs, or bring a blanket. Grab some snacks and drinks from the local food truck. Enjoy the colorful water fountain show. Afterwards, walk to the floating islands. Take in the summer air, the colorful lights. Enjoy yourself. Time spent here is quite magical.I went there with high expectations and was a bit disappointed. It wasn't as colorful as i imagined, it was just a really long water fountain.The park near it was nice to hang out at night though. Lots of food stalls are open and there are live performances too.. . . is how one tour guide accurately describes this attraction. We walked from the JW Marriott Seoul and were less than impressed -- but the Banpo Hangang Park is lovely for sitting out on a cool Seoul evening.It's great for picnic on Spring or Fall. You can enjoy the fountain also at night, but it's only beautiful after the sunset. Luckily there was a firework when I visited the bridge, so it's mire beautiful.The descriptions make it seem like a place you really want to go, but I was disappointed when I saw the 'show'. They play music and the fountain moves up and down a bit and does a wave pattern and that's pretty much it. You can barely see the coloured lights. I loved the buildings on the other side of the road, though. They change colours too and look beautiful."

코엑스 센터,190건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 강남구 삼성1동 159,103위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"The best thing for me at Co-EX is the airline check in counter. Drag your baggage to the airport check in annex at Co-Ex. Done. You get a boarding pass, get rid of your baggage - all you have to do is drag your a** to the airport and off you go.This the most convenient thing I've ever seen in my life.Make sure you have ample time on the weekends if you intend to take a taxi, limousine bus, or friend driving to Inchon or Gimpo - traffic out of Gangnam area could get interesting - consider taking the train (subway).The mall has numerous eateries, and department stores. You can spend days there (which we did). Various attractions have their own reviews, so scan through them. You can easily find the gems in those reviews.Aquarium, shopping, temple, cinema, library, food centre, Sky Garden, exhibition hall, hotels, restaurants and so much more. No wonder this is a meeting place for all as you can just about do all things here. We spend almost the whole day here, shopping, dining and of course taking photos.It's a very large complex with international brands of shops, Hyundai department store with supermarket, library, restaurants, cinema, five-star hotel (Intercontinental), conference centre, aquarium, food court, City Air Terminal that can do flight check-in. Our itinerary of that day was to have a fabulous seafood lunch in Garak seafood market (metro station #817), then took 6 stops to Samseong station (#219) where COEX mall is located, strolled around for a few hours, bought some food in supermarket before taking a taxi at Intercontinental Hotel back to our hotel apartment in city centre. Very enjoyable and convenient. Worth spending half day here. A cozy and clean mall.I came here for a conference and was impressed with its size. Loads of large rooms inside used for conferences - they had about 3 on when I was there each occupying a large room and several other spaces. There’s a multitude of restaurants and places to get food. I believe they have an underground mall as well. Really clean and well kept.This venue was very near the hotel I stayed in while visiting Seoul last year. I found it a bit hard to imagine that a mall is sharing the same building as that of the convention center. Despite of its huge size, I found it easy to explore this place, wherein I got lost looking for the convention center. I managed to find it after about 3 minutes - I realized one has to take about 2 floors up to find the convention center as the street level of this place is the mall.  After that small incident, I found it easy to navigate this place and marveled at how this building has varied designs and architecture. I especially like the garden design I saw in one part of this place.I wasn’t sure what to find, and after visiting thru I can tell you that the artistic side of it is great!
Sculptures, the World Trade Center buildings, hotels, restaurants and the Hyundai shopping mall, makes a big complex to be discovered.Coex complex is one of the most popular tourist destination located in downtown area of Seoul. Asia's biggest underground shopping mall (Coex Mall), Duty-free shop, Department Store, Casino, Book Store, Kimchi Musem, Traditional Buddist Temple, Cinema, Musical Theater and other facilities and amenities designed to provide memorable tourist experience are all located in one place, Intercontinental Seul is adjacent to Coex complex .I lived in Seoul for five years and went back to visit after eight years away. The Coex Mall has been remodeled and it is overwhelming. I'm sure Koreans love to go here but it was too confusing for a short visit.It is worth to visit. There are lots of shops. If you are in search for a place with more reasonably priced items. This place is not for you.5 more hours for the driver to arrive for the airport from Gangnam. Took the subway to COEX.nice cafe ""mamas"" at the entrance of the subway which led to the mall.Eateries are aplenty, but prices are definitely upmarket though not expensive per se.The Aquarium and a couple of Korean popstars exhibits and themed museum are all within the huge building, co-joining the exhibition halls, as well as the Hotel Inter-continental.A good walk for 2-3hra is recommended, esp if the outdoors too hot, or raining."

It will not take very long to visit the property.this temple in the middle of the city across the Intercontinental COEX hotel, is amazing; you will be surprised by the calm and serenity of this place; take a walk around and feel the power of this place;The temple is easily accessible by subway. It is located just across the road from COEX (where the aquarium is). Lovely temple with big Buddha statue. Just as I entered the temple, a magpie stopped in front of me. Did not miss the chance to take its photo. There is a small tea-shop for the visitors; from there one could just relax and view the city from its balcony.Literally across the street from the massive convention centre is this place of peace and quiet surrounded by the city. Great history and architecture,nice walks in the woods. Current construction on the site distracts a little but it's still easy to find a quiet place to pray (for Buddhists) and a peaceful escape for everyone else.This temple is just next to Coex center. It is at a hill side. Though next to busy business buildings, this place is surprisingly quiet. Few people came during the noon when I visited. There are a few buildings there and takes some climbing to see them. It is a good place if you want to escape from busy life around it for a while.Beautiful temple that has a lot to explore. Little bit of uphill walking involved but it was great to see.Its just opposite the Coex Mall by walking distance and no entrance ticket needed.There is alot of people praying here as well.A great place to visit during your stay in Seoul. There are very old pictures that are Naitonal treasures, and other monuments to see.A must to see.Stumbled on this the last day I was in Seoul. Right near the hotel, didn't even know it was here. You can walk around the temple and even stay at night if you'd like. It feels very calm and relaxing even though it is surrounded by city. Love the old and refurbished architecture.We stopped to take in some living culture - be aware, this is a practicing temple, people go there to pray and reflect, so bring your best behavior! I can't tell you how many noisy, annoying tourists we saw! For us, we simply walked the grounds, sat in the shade, and spoke quietly in whispers about the rituals and what we were experiencing. It seems as though the temple is undergoing a massive overhaul of their buildings and reorganization of the entry/grounds. Lots of orange cones, construction equipment, and scaffolding everywhere, but we'll probably go back on our next journey to see the completion."

Beware: lots of other people there for the same reason.This was so not what I was expecting to find in the middle of a shopping mall - an enormous beautifully laid out library full of people of all ages browsing a reading rather than being on their phones. Amazing!It was too crowded with people taking pictures, and noisy. It's an open area library with cafes around. The ambience wasn't my cup of tea and I was only here to take pictures.I’m not sure this would be worth making a special trip to visit, but we were already in the area to visit Bonguensa temple (just over the road from the COEX Mall) so came in to see the library. It is wonderful - as book lovers it was a real jaw dropping sight! I can’t really imagine a UK shopping mall having a public library as a centrepiece...Wonderful resource in the middle of the mall. For non-Korean readers, the offerings are a bit limited as most of the books are in Korean. Nevertheless, there is a great selection of English magazines. Very enjoyable to sit, people watch and take photos (which is what most were doing). Having said all that, it is a great idea and other malls would do well to follow suit, even with a small/modest collection, if only to encourage people to read.So this was so neat to see, it's a beautfiul library, however, it's just too crowded with people grabbing the most insta-worthy picture. I felt a bit like Belle must have in Beauty and the Beast when she saw all those books in the massive library, but I was pretty sure I couldn't read any. We left after only 10 minutes here because it was just too crowded and noisy.I wouldn't quite call this a must-see attraction. As a library - it's pretty, but it's not particularly large. Also all the books are in Korean (no surprise).What makes it more appealing is how comfortable the surroundings are (you can grab a comfortable chair, and there's a good bakery on the second level for coffee and dessert) and just how entertaining it can be if you need a bit of a rest and want to do some people watching. Interesting to watch all the people go through taking photos, selfies, staging full on photo shoots fully dressed up and posing as they ride up and down the escalator."

I was presented with a visitor certificate on arrival and hosted through a short tour. The museum was very interesting and my host was able to translate some very interesting elements of the sports history for me. The area also hosts a number of TKD stores and you can pick up good quality gear and training accessories. If visiting, plan to attend on any day except Monday, 9which is the TKD demonstration teams day off).I heard that they were doing performances, but stopped after last year. Why aren't they doing demonstrations in 2019?After practicing tkd for 20 years myself it’s an absolute must. Ppl on the property are friendly and helpful. Entry is freeSeeing the team training is one of the most impressive things for every sportsman. Definitely recommendCome back Seoul every year.Wonderful stayWonderful placeKukkiwon are a mecca of taekwondo All practice Going in this site.Museum events.Go into this place!!!!!!One of the best Taekwondo demonstration I have seen, the plank breaking was really impressive. Show duration is about one hour and the performance hall is about 10 minutes walk from Gangnam station, exit 12.I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Kukkiwon's Taekwando demonstration show. It told a story, and combined TKD moves into a narrative with a big screen in the background. I had expected to just see people do some routines. This was much more interesting. The artists did a great job too, with many difficult moves. I deducted a star because, as an english-only speaker, it was hard to get tickets. I had to contact AskAjumma to get tickets for me. And the time of the show was not advertised anywhere that I could find. But once I had the tickets, there was a nice gentlemen at the arena who helped us get seated. After the show they invited people who wanted to break a board to come onto the stage. The emcee spoke English and Korean so my kids were able to join in and broke their first board! Very cool.It is a great organization but for a tourist not much of a site to visit unless you go to their demo show ""Great Tae Kwon Do"". It combines legend, a ton of board breaking and action. It was a blast! At the end you can break a board with the cast. Their website sucks so get someone Korean speaking to figure out times.A wonderful institute established by Kukkiwon to promote globally the Korean tradition of Taekwando. They have a museum and cafetaria for visitors to explore. They also regularly organize international competition and demonstrations of Taekwando. It was an amazing experience participating in the September 2016 festival. I got to see the talented competitors of all age groups from different nations participating. Several nations also presented tradition dances and had their food stalls during this festival."

관악산,30건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 관악구 관악로 (우) 08791,14위(116곳의 서울 소재 야외 활동 중),"my friend and I started climbing the mountain at about 3pm starting at sadang, and ended 7.15pm at gwachon city hall. we are both relatively fit (though I do badly going down rocks) but we found ourselves trying to beat the night! super awesome hike though. the trip up was relatively easy with loads of stairs, though note that the actual elevation would be more than 600m given that we would have to traverse a few small hills before getting to the peak from sadang. going down towards gwachon had less of such small hills, but the trails were not well marked and there were very few stairs, so do have your online maps with the trails ready (I used maps.me) in case you get off course (we did a few times). I would recommend bringing some light snacks and a hiking stick along -- they certainly helped me with keeping my balance scrambling down those rocks and gave me the much needed energy boost when my legs got wobbly.highly recommended hike, in all. the route is very scenic even though the peak itself is not very interesting. :pWe thoroughly enjoyed our hike at Gwanaksan. We parked at Seoul National University and had an easy walk to the trail entrance. We kept to the path along the stream and stopped a few times for a dip and to cool off. Beautiful location and so easy to drive and park here. Our only complaint was you had to make an online reservation for the ropes course and our phone doesn’t have Hangul which seemed to be the problem with getting a reservation. No matter course guides were there waiting for participants and the office had a few people with nothing to do but make reservations. Too bad the Internet was the only way - modern technology didn’t work in our favor to add the ropes course to top off an already fun day.We were lucky to climb the mountain on a perfect day. Started at 9 am. It was clear and 20 c. It is a steep climb though a temperate broadleaved forest. So you are out of the sun. But very steep, straight up the mountain with lots of boulders. Have good shoes, take your time and bring water. We took about 1,5 hours to reach top and hour down. By the it was about 25 c and convective clouds were forming. Going down can be hard on knees. Most locales my age had walking sticks. Really impressed with the amount of people in 50s and 60s doing the climb. It is a great opportunity to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Today our view was perfect. I recommend going in morning on mild days. On hot, humid summer day the hike could be quite strenuous.I and my friend went on hiking to Gwanaksan and it was the best thing I did in Seoul. It was very exhausting YES but it was so fun too. Sharing stories with fellow hikers on the way. It was a good exercise and so many older people go there on regular basis. I would too if I live there. Up there you can see a portion of the City, if not all. Very wonderful, cover-photoable shots in the top.This is a great alternative to Bukhansan, which although great, is a bit out of the way if you are in the center of Seoul and short on time. I recommend starting at Sadang because the views from that trail are spectacular.And not sure what to expect. The walk from the station to the entrance was tough enough. The seasoned old folks were warning us that it could be too difficult, looking at how inexperience we were. But we made it to the TOP! Not all easy and some slippery slope .... it all worth it. For the view and the sense of achievement!Mt. Gwanak, or Gwanaksan, is an excellent hiking option for anyone in Seoul who wants to get away, but not have to travel too far. Completely accessible by metro, this mountain is not the tallest, but it offers great views from the summit and has a temple that is dramatically set on the edge of a cliff - very picturesque! Like many hiking trails in Korea, there are a ton of stairs to climb, but there are also rocky parts that add some variety to the hike. I would say this is an intermediate hike. Not easy, but definitely not too hard technically. There are restrooms along the trail, but no toilet paper, so bring your own. Also bring plenty of water and a nice snack to enjoy.There are other trails that begin from different starting points. Here are detailed instructions on how to get to this particular trailhead that leads to the temple on the cliff. I found these directions online and followed them successfully on my solo hike, so the instructions are tried and true. Hope you find this helpful! Enjoy!-Take subway line #4 to Gwacheon Station.-At the station, head for Exit #2 and take escalator up.-At top of escalator, just walk straight out.-You’ll see the mountain above the trees across the street.-Continue on sidewalk until you see a sign that says Library Junction. Cross the street here.-After crossing the street, turn RIGHT and continue walking.-Soon, you will see a brown sign that points LEFT toward Gwanaksan which is 1km away (the sign also mentions other destinations).-Follow that road until you reach an intersection with a sign pointing RIGHT for Gwanaksan, cross the street and continue walking (there’s a convenience store on the corner).-Continue walking (passing a school on your right) until you reach a T-intersection with big mirrors for cars to see around the corner.-You’ll see another brown sign pointing LEFT for Gwanaksan.-Continue walking. You’ll pass a parking lot on your right but that trail is for a smaller summit.-Soon, you’ll see a small food stand and a bathroom on your right.-There’s a stream coming off the mountain with a bunch of tents on the left bank.-Cross the bridge and continue up the small road past the food vendors.-You should see the trailhead.I was staying at SNU faculty house and decided to walk a morning. I found the entrance to a trail at Nakseogaede Park and pleasantly discovered that it was part of an amazing trail ring of more than 150 km surrounding Greater Seoul. I, obviously, only followed a tiny portion of it, and didn't even make it to the top of the mountain. But it was a great experience. Sometimes a challenge, pleasant in general, you get great views of Seoul from many parts of it.beutiful mountain with various entertainment. if you don't want to go peak just want some fresh air from green, it has perfect side road full of flowers. if you are healthy enough to enjoy bit tough hiking you can see Yeonjuam, a Buddhist temple on cliff. you can enter the mountain through Seoul national university, the top ranked one in SK. it has soeuldae-ipgu nearby, you can get entertained with cheap gourmets and stuff.I went there as part of my exchange in Seoul National University. It has a great view and many many old Koreans climb it everyday. It is steep sometimes but my friends and I who are not great Hikers managed to do it quite easily!"
서울대학교 미술관,16건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 관악구 관악로 1,293위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"The museum had several parts closed down for renovation. I was led to believe they had some western art, which peaked my interest. I caught the last day of the Eternal Narcissist exhibit by Chun Kyung-ja, and was grateful for the exposure to someone I wasn't familiar with and to learn about her. Even though my expectations weren't met, I was not disappointed in the least. The grounds are lovely and the price was right!Amazing place to visit, very impressive. Great collection of arts and crafts which are laid down for us to admire. A must see!I wanted to check out a new place that I hadn't been to in Seoul. I found this place online and thought I would check it out. Positives: It's a short bus ride from Seoul National University Station and the admission is only W3,000. Also, the view from outside the museum was more interesting than what was inside it.Negatives: There was an exhibition of Kim Jong Yun art. There were some paintings, three-dimensional abstract rock sculptures, and regular sculptures of people. The only thing I liked were the sculptures of the people and I couldn't take pictures of them.It also took me a very short time to look through it. I was done in less than 30 minutes."

서울 어린이 대공원,373건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 광진구 능동로 216 (우) 04991,35위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"The park is attractive to both adults and children in autumn (late Oct./ early Nov.). The autumn colours are fascinating but they vary from year to year depending on weather, etc. This year, the summer is long and dry but the ginkgo and maple trees still show off their beautiful autumn colours, although not as good as those of last year. The park has a good zoo, apart from an amusement park, etc. I like to go there (and to the Seoul Grand Park) when I visit Seoul, as both are great places for photography and leisure.My 17 month old daughter was so extremely excited to see all the animals and did not want to leave. Korea has so many family-friendly places and this is definitely one of them. I think I may have seen some strollers to rent on our way in, not entirely sure. Overall, this was a lovely experience for both of us and we look forward to going back with my husband.We went with our 20month old toddler and really enjoyed the whole day there. It's a huge park with outdoor and indoor playground. Probably because we went on a weekday, the whole park was very quiet. Entrance to the main park is free, but certain attractions charge a fee.Key highlights1) best thing about this place is the Seoul Children's Museum. There's an entrance fee but it's not expensive. They also allow u to exit and re-enter on the same day. There are 4 storeys catering to different children age groups and the set up on each floor is very impressive, especially the water play on level 3! I think it's fun for all kids from toddlers to teens.2) catch the animal show called Anistory featuring many types of animals including seals, birds, cats, monkey etc. Need to pay for entry though. It's quite entertaining. Even though we didn't understand the language, we still enjoyed it very much. 3) the park is massive, great if u like outdoor walks. There's a huge water fountain show near the Seoul Children's Museum that's quite impressive too. Overall a nice destination that offers both indoor and outdoor experiences. I didn't like the mini zoo though. Each enclosure was very small and the animals looked a bit depressed. I wouldn't recommend if your only objective is to visit the zoo.This place is a hidden gem and not many tourists visit this park. Very nice, clean and spacious park with lots to see like gardens, playground & mini-zoo. Kids would definitely love this place. The mini-zoo is a little sad as it's under-maintained and some animals look sad in their enclosures. Plus point: Nice, clean and spacious park. Free entry except for the amusement park section. Not crowded!Negative: Somewhat under-maintained. Has the potential to be much betterWe had a great time though it was so hot. You need to bring or buy lots of water. There are lots of places where you can find food/snack/ice water or other beverages. The kids loved the musical fountain, the water playground, the animals, the Anishow. We spent around 4 hours looking around and playing.Information found online about the Children’s Grand Park can sometimes be sketchy and inconsistent.I hope that the following will provide a better picture for those planning to visit the park. I have also attached a picture of the park map that I will refer to below.The park can be accessible by 2 subway stations.The main gate (#1 on map) is accessible easily by the Children's Grand Park Station on Line 7.There is a rear gate (#36 on map) that is accessible by the Achasan Station on Line 5.The park has no entrance fee, except for the amusement park section.My suggestion is that children below 14 yrs will appreciate the park.I brought a tween son, and 2 pre-school kids to the park.All three enjoyed the amusement park (#38 on map), which is closer to the rear gate. The amusement park had rides catering to pre-school kids to tweens. Do note there are some rides that have a 120cm height requirement. Rides such as the Viking, Dropzone and Roller coaster are generally adapted for tweens. For those a little younger, there are bumper cars and spinning saucers that are children friendly. However, this place would not be recommended for toddlers. A cafeteria is found within the amusement park serving traditional Korean foods and burgers. Nothing to shout about but it satisfies the tummy.Amusement park entrance fees depends on the type of ticket you purchase. Tickets are available in single ride, 5 rides, 10 rides and unlimited rides options.For the 5 ride option, kids paid 16,000 won. Adults paid 19,000 for the same ticket.Toddlers and pre-school kids should check out the playground (#12 on map) with wet play and dry obstacle options. Bring your toys for sand play if you wish.The other attraction we tried was the zoo <U+2013> a mini zoo at that. We saw an elephant, snakes, birds and baboons. A couple of macaws looked like they were suffering from a disease that caused balding on their body. The kids enjoyed the zoo but soon lost interest in it once they stepped out of the zoo.Next to the zoo is a pavilion which sells snacks (#34 on map) like ice-cream, corn dogs and cold drinks <U+2013> a great respite from the heat.2 attractions that we did not visit <U+2013> the children’s museum (#46 on map) and Kid’s Auto Park (#44 on map) would probably suit school going kids.Directions:For the museum, and auto park, use the main gate.For the amusement park, use the rear gate.The zoo is in the middle of the park and are equidistant from either gates.In summary, this park is accessible by 2 subway lines. It provides a place for kids to be themselves and preserves the sanity of parents who want kids to run wild and not bother them for too much over a couple of hours. School going children will probably benefit the most out of a half day excursion to this park.The park is quite far from where we stay at myeongdong and we paid 13,000KRW for the cab ride. The park is free and contains a zoo (where the animals look quite sad) and there is a little amusement park when you can pay for the rides. The main highlight for us is the Seoul Children's Museum located near the main entrance.Only covered a small part of it, as we were mostly busy with the museum, but what we saw was fun. A great big playground (with no shade though), big music fountain, a junk-made sculpture walk, a beautifully designed orangery... Lots to see!The park was pretty good, but even better was the FREE Zoo. Lots of animals to see, had some gardens to visit, and has a large children's museum to visit. There are also some walkways over ponds and sculptures to see as you walk around. There was also food stops encase you needed something in a rush but I saw many people bringing in lunches.Excellent place to bring your kids with the free zoo and exhibits.Do spare time for the children's museum as well, plenty of the little ones to explore inside."
롯데시네마 건대입구,8건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 광진구 아차산로 272 (우) 05065,55위(285곳의 서울 소재 즐길 거리 / 게임 중),"On Wednesdays and Sundays during the month of August, 2018, four selected Lotte Cinemas are screening the Royal Ballet's live performance of Manon filmed at the Royal Opera House, London, 07 March 2018. A friend and I had a wonderful experience when we attended one of these screenings on Korea's Liberation Day, 15 August. The film was shown in Lotte's Charlotte Premium Seating small theater located inside the Konkuk University Lotte Cinema complex. Prior to attending we had been feeling a little disgruntled over the 40,000W charge for the ticket - usually at other theaters special screenings of live opera or ballet cost 30,000W. Well, we were pleasantly surprised and quickly stopped quibbling about the cost. Charlotte premium seating has a special sliding door entrance to a comfortable air conditioned lounge with cinema staff in attendance to look after movie-goers. We presented our tickets and were asked to choose a complimentary drink and were also given complimentary vouchers for another film at a general Lotte Cinema. We entered the theater and found our great big armchair seats smelt of real leather. The little table on the arm of each seat had a complimentary bottle of chilled water and the theaterette was super airconditioned - thank goodness! Once we were comfortably seated staff brought our drinks plus a snack of a packet of biscuits. I have back problems so was delighted to find the luxury seat could be comfortably adjusted for my back and legs, it was very, very good. I found this was the most enjoyable way imaginable to watch a film - it couldn't have been better - I can't wait to go there again, it was absolutely worth the money we paid .... especially in contrast to my unpleasant experience at World Tower Lotte Cinema - Hall 16 when I attended another Royal Ballet screening last year for 30,000W in an unpleasant, strongly-musty-smelling small theater with no complimentary drinks or snacks - at the end of the film my nose had still not got used to the horrible dank smell!Thank you Lotte Cinema Konkuk University Entrance for the excellent facilities and service - a really super experience!!! For Arts-lovers ... I brought home a programme from Charlotte with information on future movie screenings in 2018 from the Royal Opera House, London; the Nutcracker Ballet will be screening in November, Liam Scarlett's new Swan Lake ballet in December, Bizet's opera Carmen in September and Verdi's(?I think) MacBeth in October."

If wanting to see a sporting event be sure to try and get tickets in advance. However, with that said the websites for Korean sport teams are very protracted with a lack of English.Are the floor tickets there good? Is there enough space for people to stand and see the stage or is it cramped ? Am hoping to attend a Queen concert in 2020 and was wonderingDifferences between baseball games at Angel Stadium in Anaheim, CA vs here: Food is much cheaper, but there are no vendors selling at your seat. A box of about 25 meaty chicken nuggets was about $10 and fed 3 of us. Water bottles were only $1, beer only $3. Cheap seats were $13. Only 1 merchandise location outside the stadium so shop before or after the game. No 7th inning stretch or kiss cam, but they had cheerleaders and contests, and even an American player on the winning team. No rap music to suffer through, but fans know their chants and fully support their teams. there are restrictions as to the size of bag you can bring in and types of bottles, so check the website before you go. We entered with ticketless entry on our friend’s phone. Easy to get there by train and beautiful area.We went to see The Weeknd here. This stadium is huge and a great place to see a concert. However, coming from the western world, if you're not seeing a K-Pop act, the crowd will be fairly timid and relatively quiet.We went here for the korean music festival and had a very good experience. A lot of fun, and the area also had good temperatures (probably aircondition), which was perfect for us to escape the hot summer weather.The stadium is huge and surprisingly warm during winter. Commuting to the sky dome is easy. I had a great time watching Big Bang concert on 31st December 2017.It's a bit more sterile -- and of course cleaner--than Doosan Bear's Jamsil Stadium, but there is no better place to be when its 90 degrees outside and the fans are going wild, the entire 9 innings. For the best experience of watching Korean baseball sit in the sections in front of the ceerleading stands -- 104, 105, 202, 203 for home team Nexen Heroes and 110, 110, 208, 209 for visiting team. If for just watching baseball, anywhere is good. As prior reviewers noted, one of the major drawbacks is lack of few food choices and the menus are in Korean (no English help)I finally got to visit this stadium for the Hanwha Eagles vs Nexen Heroes, and the fans make the visit next level! The food stands are plentiful with so many options to choose from. Everything from pizza to sushi and beer. Thanks for having me!Went to my first every baseball game (Nexan Heroes VS Lotte Giant's) and even though it was a poor game there was a very good atmosphere, although I suspect it was mostly from the noisy Lotte Giant away fans. The stadium is a massive indoor arena and is nice and cool with the aircon on. Good food and plenty of variety within and outside the stadium and there is a quaint little fan shop where you can find all the essential merchandise and also very fancy jackets. I also enjoyed the product competitions during the breaks in play even though I don't understand Korean, I found it really entertaining. I am not a baseball fan but I might consider going to other matches in the future because of this match. Good location for the stadium near subway station and there is also some futsal football pitches next to the stadium of you fancy a kickabout before the game.Finally I got to go to the Skydome. Generally, great stadium. Well designed, looks great and holds the noise really well. A few little glitches though. There is not a lot of variety for food when attending a baseball game. There are just a few chicken shops and a small convenience store or two. Also, the service there could be a little better. I know tonight was busy and all, but the servers there could ask more questions about the ticket people want, and the tickets could be a little clearer telling people about seating etc. Generally though, the stadium is great and I am sure they will add more to it."

A short walk of perhaps 5 mins.It's mostly the local korea brands in here without those international branded brands. Good to visit this place if you have time to spare and not a must. Can't really figure out how the pricing works here. Sometimes, there are additional discount off the tag on items we bought. Spent half a day here and we didn't buy much either.We got quite a good deal of 50% at the North Face over at the nearby Lotte outlet.There are few malls around that area and it is easily accessible by subway. The Lotte mall also nearby but a bit more expensive. Worth to drop by.It’s my first visit. But not many brand shops without few big brand. Price also was not outlet price.3 buildings for you to shop. Lotte factory outlet building is just next door. Don’t waste time there.Compared to the other places around, I find Mario to be the be the best in terms of coverage and price. It's a bit crowded but that's to be expected. There're a total of 3 buildings connected. The price is the same as the Lotte outlet next door, but Mario has more brand and choices.I recommend spending at least 3 hrs+ here to hunt for the best deal.I was disappointed because I thought I could find some western brands here such as Coach, Gucci, Prada among others but this outlet mall mostly has Korean Brands. The shoes options such as adidas and nike weren't also as extensive.travel very easy to go, more more shop and more hawkers area (product cheaper than Hong Kong, good quality)Brands are mid-range or parochial, prices are not impressive and it is comparable in both price and selection to the Hyundai department store across the street. Doesn't feel like a real value proposition- if you want cheap stick to underground malls/street markets. Neighbourhood is boring and out of the way to boot. Nah.Location is near if compared to outlets in paju. Price is little more expensive if compared than paju and the collection is not as large as ones in paju but price wise and time wise it is better to shop here.By the time we get there, we got free car parking. I think it is because some technical error of the operator. But still nice!Oh. And there is lotte outlet too nearby, right next to mario outlet.Tons to choose from a lot of great clothing decently priced not too much money and it's really conveniently close to the subway
 In addition there are good restaurants and there is the movie theaters."

The museum exhibits has English explanation, dedicating the life and achievements of King Sejong. There is a small movie room where you can watch a video as well. It also connects to another part of the museum dedicated to Admiral Yi Sun-Shin. He is famous for defeating the Japanese with the famed turtle ship that helped win the war. There is a replica of a turtle ship you can walk on. Being underground and free admission, it is a good way to take a break from the heat or rain, enjoy some air con and also use the toilet facilities.Briefly, we passed by the memorial hall of King Sejong. It was a nice area to check Korea's hangul (alphabet) history.Constructed in the memory Greatest king of Korea, King Sejong , this underground museum traces his life, achievement and contribution to the development of the nation.We passed by the underground museum when we were heading to the Palace from the Stream. The entrance way under the King’s statue, no admission fee. Good to have a quick visit if you don’t have much time. Not so crowded as other places in Seoul.This underground museum is a good place to visit if you're passing by Gwanghamun Square. It's a good way to escape the heat during a hot day, to warm yourself during winter and to pass time during a rainy day.You'll get to be inspired by the story of King Sejong as you walk thru the tunnel, read his achievements and see how his works have benefited the country.Connected with the king Sejong statue on the guanghuamun square and it's a free admission exhibition, which shows how the Hanja was created (by king Sejong) the evolution of Korea, next to it is the Yi sun sin exhibition, which shows a replica of the infamous turtle battleship. There are activities for kids also practising Hanja characters, rebuilding of the battle ship etc.Not being familiar with this aspect of Korean history, this was a nice introduction. The museum is open, modern, and well maintained. Offered several opportunities for children to interact using technology. This would be good for a rainy day as it is all indoors. It is located near the Palace, Ferry Memorial, and US embassy. There are several coffee shops within walking distance. To be honest, I didn't go too into depth at this museum, but it was nice to walk around and get the gist of it.Lot of Information is on display. Videos , Photos & Historic relics have been kept inside
Must visit for TouristsThis place has interactive displays and some very informative sections on two of Korea's greatest heroes. As a non-Korean speaker there was still enough information for me to get a great deal out of our visit. Not sure the 4D film added much, but it was free, and only lasted 9 minutes!"

망원 한강공원,10건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 마포구 마포나루길 467 (우) 04005,254위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"This is one of Hangang Riverside Parks. The location is quite suburb and it's not that crowded normally. Once you are here, you can take a walk slowly or spend some time on lawns.There aren't many things to do. But, fishing decks are quite interesting to see. You can see people fishing there.Also, Seoul Battleship Park is locating within this park.We were staying at an Airbnb beside Mangwon Market and our host suggested that I walk to Hangang Park on the bank of the Han River, about a 10 minute walk. The walk turned out to be a little longer than that and I arrived at blue hour during some light rain.The park is pretty large and has climbing frames for kids and great views along the Han river and across the other side of buildings lit up in the night. There are also excellent views of the Seongsan Bridge which is also lit up.One of the most interesting parts of the park is the Seoul Battleship Park which is set within Mangwon Hangang Park. This park includes giant ships propellers and small navy boats both in the water and set up on stands in the park. The main building of the museum was still open but close to closing so for the cost of paying 3,000 Won to enter I gave it a miss.Overall, for bringing the kids in the daytime, for jogging and exercising or for strolling along the bank of the Han River, this is a pretty nice place to spend a little time."

If you are young and visiting Seoul for the first time, I would also suggest staying in the Hongdae area, it's really never a dull moment here even at night time. Amazing restaurants that are very affordable, cheap street food and of course arts as well. You can also check out the Hongdae Free Market on Saturdays.it was a ncie street, full of cute lil things. it is basically for teenagers especially for girls. They have many quaint lit shop that sell cosmetic, jewelleries, accessories and clothings too.For my opinion should go on the night. you can saw so mouch live music and dancer on the street it was enjoy.Also you can buy clothes in the streetIt is a good place to relieve stress not only by children but alsoadults at slime cafes. The inside of the cafe is clean and the staff is kind. The price is low, soyou can build memories with friends and get closer. As soon as you start to touch it with yourhands, you will feel better.This area has a California Berkeley University flare. Diverse eatery’s, beer, coffee houses, etc. The metro stop is in the middle. A great kick back place a cute walking area.Pretty cool. Lots of activity. Right behind and parallel to the street, in the evening, it is bustling. Lots of people, restaurants, and K-Pop bands showcasing their skills!Plenty of good people watching, shopping, and eating to do here. You can walk for a while and eat your way along. Fun way to spend a couple hours exploring some of the local area.Hongdae shopping street comes alive at night. Highly recommended to stay near the area if you enjoy street food with reasonably priced restaurants, fashionable streetwear, clubbing/bar hoping and noraebong (karaoke rooms). Everything night is a Friday night so a warning to those who don’t enjoy crowds and noise until the wee hours of the morning.Lots of food and bars, very reasonably priced, also good for shopping. Much busier then Ewha Women’s University. A must visit spot.There is food all over this area, From Korean BBQ, to Sushi, to Bibimbap, Coffee Shops you name it. My personal favorite is Bibiri for Affordable Delicious Bibimbap. It is in a basement and hard to find, but totally worth it."

This spa is close to where my hotel is, so I decided to get it a try. Price wise, it is very reasonable but the facilities are very old and run down. The steam room is nothing spectacular. The resting room is dirty and there is this gentleman cleaning and stacking the mattress making a lot of noise without considering people are sleeping and resting. Unless there is no other choice, I will not recommend this place.This spa is easily accessible for those staying in Hongdae. The staff don't speak a lot of English but they are willing to help. There are lockers outside the spa <U+2013> ignore these as they aren't used. If you want a scrub, make sure you have KRW.20,000 cash,which you can give to the Ajimmas in the bathes who do the scrubbing. You'll.pay KRW.10,000 at the front desk to use the baths in addition to this. Your shoes go in a small locker with a key, then you'll also get a larger locker with an RFID lock for your clothes. I got this wrong the first time and put all my things in the one locker. I was eventually corrected by one of the staff. Learn from my errors and have a great time!This was my first time at a spa, it was near 2am and it was after a night of drinking at a baseball game.Paid 9000 won to use the sauna area.Guy inside guided me what to do with the lockers and sent me on my way. I thought it was pretty nice and refreshing. Sauna, bathe, shower was refreshing. Even brushed my teeth and what not.Contrary to some of the reviews read, I got quite a relative pleasant experience here. Counter service was good. There will be uncle inside the changing room who later guided me as this was my first time here. The only thing I hoped could improved would probably be including some of the English translation. FYI, I visited close to 12 midnight.I stayed happy day spa 2 times November 2017.I paid by credit card and I did not get receipt at 2nd time.When I came back to my country and check how much I paid,I paid double price which I paid at first time.So be careful.You should always ask to get receipt.If you are thinking about using this facility, i would like to tell you not to do. Staffs are very unkind(they are only kind for so-called 'health club(fitness club)' members. And electric key does not function properly. If u want feel BAD EXPERIENCE in Korean, then I do not care.Old and worn out. Basic facilities. Staff in jjimjilbang incredibly rude, shouting at you if you fall asleep. Will never return. Siloam is much nicer in my opinion.This is my 2nd Hanjeunmuk in this trip. I came in around 5pm. Not many people. The staff was ok with English and staff let me kow the $tix by pointing the pictures. I saw some wastern customers already in the spa. I didn't order any body srub as i just did it days ago. B1-spa and shower, B2 gym, resting area. B3- Hanjeunmuk, and huge rest area.( As i remember) good place to stay and sleep if your flight (arrives/leaves) in the middle of the night. Save $.If you have been to dragon Hill spa and feel that it is very packed. Then you can try this place. It have lesser crowd which is good if you want to have some rest. It is cheaper as well. And it is nearer to myeongdong. With lots of other activities may late at night in hongik.Huge jjimjabang without all the pretentiousness of the fancier ones in town. If you want to see what an authentic jjimjabang is like; soak in the pools here, dip into the frozen room, grab some delicious food and crash out for the night."

Luckily, it is located in an area which is waaaaaay more interesting.I really do not have much to talk about this place really. I guess if you are within the vicinity, you can drop by for a quick visit.The market was smaller than we expected with only around 20 -25 stalls on the day we visited. It’s in a very lively area with lots of shops and drinking places. Probably not worth a special trip but if you’re in the area...First time here on a Chuseok holidays, I thought will be quiet but surprisingly NOT! The place is hip and happening with street performance about 5 different type to watch and support and you may tip them for some cash :) walk along the streets with so many ladies clothes, sports shops and also for guys. There's also street food as well. I am still feeling hungry, luckily there's a mall in Hongdae has Halal Guys for me to dine :PI came to the location after 1 PM that’s when the information said that it “opened” - but found ... a regular street of shops and stalls, and a few “buskers,” but certainly nothing that wasn’t open an hour before. I wandered pretty extensively, so I’m confident I was in the right place, but unimpressed for an “art market.” Fun to wander, but not as an art market.Lots of things happening here - plenty of atmosphere- buskers, great shops  food stalls and even nicer cafes (where you can actually sit!)
 Good prices here as it is in a university area and caters for kids with not a lot of money.Another gem provided by our driver. We met an artist who did wonderful oil paint reproductions of actual photographs for an very low cost. We visited the market in the afternoon and paintings of our three grandkids and two of my favorite airplanes were delivered to our hotel by seven in gathering evening. Lots of neat Korean art items.Every time we visit Seoul, we always schedule a weekend to go to Hongdae Art Free Market. It is an open area where artists get the chance to showcase their talents thru stuff like jewelries, potteries, leather goods, clothes, postcards, paintings, etc. All designs are handmade. You can even have your portraits made while waiting. My 2 girls and I enjoyed walking around and appreciating the talents of the artists who participated in the free market. We bought quite a handful of products and we loved them. Some stalls even accept credit cards. Try and visit this place when you are in Seoul.A place for youngsters and teens. Lots of apparel shops, cafes etc. There were teens performing K pop dance and songs. We went on a Monday so it was not really crowded. A must go place for the young and young at heart.Lots of food and apparels store. The place is livelier with the younger generations vibes. It is a must not miss place to go visit when in seoul.Is totally different with Myeong Dong walking street. Selling different range of stuff and food. Must pay a visit when in Seoul."

The views from here are stunning. It's crazy to think you have cars driving at full speed on one side then the stunning view of the Han river on the other. We walked across the entire bridge to yeouido hangang park. It was perfect timing because friday evening they have a night market that's open with amazing food options and lots of music festivals.

This place has lots of delicious snacks and street food and you can see stalls selling hugh and tiny reddish, hugh cabbage and big red apples, etc. Worth a visitA traditional market near Mangwon Station. Good to visit.- Featured by media several times. This is popular even locating in a residential area.- This is quite away from other touristic areas. But, we saw some foreign tourists.- Very huge. The market continues even outside the arcade. Also, Mangwondong Worldcup Market is right across the road.- Various places to try street foods and they are affordable. If you don't know what to try, have some at crowded places.The market is a local community asset that the residents support in order to sustain it. 

It was good to visit such a market rather than only see a market aimed at tourists.Walk within 5-10 minutes from subway station to this market and it's easy to find using Naver maps. During walks, there are some shop sell fruits or local food and products. Inside the market, there are stall who sell raw meat, vegetables, banchan (korean side dish), local food snack shop, etc.. well, it's a traditional market and you can find anything. I bought strawberry for 3000 Won (big pack, 24 pcs). Strawberry is big and very sweet. I eat famous kalguksu (noodles with broth soup) which cost me 3500 Won with a very big portion. The restaurant is not too big that I have to queue for 5-8 minutes and 1 person 1 order. You can't share the meals even though it's very big for my size. I bought odeng (fish cake) for 2000 Won 3 pcs and it's delicious also thick (not like the one I eat in Hongdae). Very chewy. I also bought rice with red bean which is very good also. Oh my ... I do have a larger stomach so I can eat all of the food here ... hahahaha...Mangwon Market is a long sheltered street with shops at both sides selling all types of food. Unless you browsing at every stall and eating your way thru, one can cover the market in 1-2 hours. There are all types of food. There are cooked and raw food, meat, vegetables, seafood, fruits, marinated food.We had a pork and chicken culet near end of the market and the meat was great.We went here on Monday, 24 Dec 2018. It is difficult to find this market. We have to walk about 10min from mangwon station and there is no sign to this market from mangwon exit. We have to ask several person to find this market. Just a local traditional market with limited foods. 3 Odeng = 2000 won ( cheaper than odeng in myeongdong @ 2000 won )Although I love the Gwangjang Market, it is extremely busy and tourists tend to make walking through very difficult. This market has delicious food for much better prices. Short rib patties, mandu, famous fried chicken, croquettes, hotteok, fermented stingray, kalguksu and so much more ready-made food. There is even an Isaac's Toast without the busy line. He location is so good if you are near the world cup stadium or Hongdae area. Much better choice for those serious about the food scene!We were staying in an Airbnb just adjacent to the market so as I really enjoy traditional markets it was perfect to go explore this one. The market is very long and mostly covered with all kinds of interesting produce from fresh fruit and vegetables to meat, seafood and kimchi and dimsum and so much more. There were stores selling aquariums, shoes, hardware and there were mini supermarkets too.About halfway down there are public toilets as well as a park and some eat places. The places selling food can be found all around the market, but the best time to get really delicious street food at the market is at night time when the market really comes alive.This is a local market in a residential area, but a pretty huge market. If you are into traditional wet markets then this is a nice one.Stopped at Mangwon market on a bike tour. A very interesting insight into how local Korean people live. The food was delicious and their speciality is fried chicken although they do have stalls for all manner of different types of food. It’s relatively inexpensive but I would recommend trying the spicy chicken before you buy a box as it is HOT!!This market is far from city. However, it is a very local and authentic wet market. You can see the local shop and done here. If you want to understand local Seoul peoples living, this is a highly recommended place to go."
하늘공원,293건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 마포구 하늘공원로 95 (우) 03900,11위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"I went to Haneul Park in Mid Nov and flowers have withered. All that were left are field of brown Lalang. Definitely, was hoping for more colours but can't be help that I went at the wrong timing. Personally felt that the park will be enchanted if we went at the right time with flowers blooming.You will be required to climb stairs up to the park. After the short climb, the gradient is gentle. It took us around 45 minutes to finish exploring the park, taking photographs. The park is a 10 minutes walk from world cup stadium, making it accessible by public transport.The weather was cooling then at around 10-14 degree Celsius making the walk enjoyable. It was a worth a trip there as you can visit Mapo-Gu or Hongdae easily after. It will be added bonus if you plan the trip well and see the seasonal flowers in timely manner.Overall, a beautiful place to go to if you have extra time to spare and is looking for a spot for instagram worthy pictures.I found this place from a few blogs that recommended scenic places to visit in South Korea. It is not hard to get here. Just needed to walk quite a distance from the train station. This visit to the park is very nice if you have one whole day to spare and relax walking around to just look at the scenery. There are other parks nearby but the area is very huge and you cannot visit them all in one day. Our feets are also hurting from the long walk. I visited during the end of Autumn, nearing winter. It was worth the trip here because it is really as beautiful as described in the blogs and when I was there, there wasn't a lot of people or tourists. Only the starting area has some crowd, but when you start to walk up and explore the tall plant areas, it is very peaceful and quiet. And you can take beautiful photo there. Just remember to bring a tripod if you have no one to help you take photo! I would suggest not to step into the plant area as it will kill the plants. There are already some area that people have cleared for you to step into so you can walk around and find those areas to take your photos instead. If you do not want to hike up, there is a place near the bottom of the park to purchase a ticket for the buggy car to bring you up, One way or round trip. The ride is very nice if you can sit at the back seats which was what we did.  If you are hungry, there is a little snack shop near the tall grass area, with many choices of food and beverages. There's also a few table and benches where you can rest and eat your snacks or instant noodles on. Just outside the train station, there are some shops selling clothes if you are not wearing enough.I come to Hanuel Park on autumn day. The weather is so cool and little hot at noon.The park is near by World Cup Stadium.It's so easy to go to there by subway.And you take electric car to the top or climb to there.You should go to pinky grass hill.It has fresh air and clear blue sky. I really enjoyed the moment there. You can go there by subway to World Cup Stadium Station and walk about 1 kilometres to Haneul Park. You can choose shuttle bus and pay about KRW 5,000 for round trip or just walk by the upstairs to the destination. It was good experience!!!Its my 2nd time here, went on summer 2018 and autumn 2019.You can see the park in many photos in social media. Its a nice backdrop for photos.Its crowded when we visited, long line for the golf-cart shuttle service.Visit this park for views of the river, city and football stadium. The area was a land fill turned into an attractively landscaped hill. It is a popular destination especially when its tall grasses seed and turn red. The hill top has a cafe and toilets. The staircase serving the hill features 291 steps, so bare that in mind when you start to climb it.Instagram brought us here! The park is huge, from the size of it, probably 90% is filled with silvergrass and the rest is pink muhly grass and kochia. We arrived early in the morning and had to walk around 20 minutes from World Cup station to reach the foot of the hill. There are 3 options to reach the top, by tram, stairs or hill climb. We opted for stairs and get down by hill. There was silvergrass festival during my trip but it wasnt fully bloom yet. Pink muhly grass on the other hand was blooming perfectly but the land plot for pink muhly is too small hence huge crowd. Overall experience, we had great time hereYou may call it hype, marketing, commercialized space... I call it, a patch of beautiful nature called PARKIf you have the time, GO Autumn is the best time to go when the grass turns pink and the leaves are yellow. The path is already an adventure with the different sounds that tingle your sensesThe signage around about wild creatures make you appreciate their respect for nature and the natural habitat of animalsSome say it is nice to go on foot instead of riding the buggy... I think paying 3,000 Won is better then perhaps fulfilling your step while at the top moving from one section to the other is much better.Make sure to take a drink with you because you will want to sit in one of the huts with a cold drink on hand (and maybe some snacks)-DONT FORGET THE SUNSCREEN!Interesting at the top with the grass land and good views of Seoul. Noticed long lines for the shuttle to the top. Not sure why so many waiting for shuttle. You could walk to top in less time than in line. And there is a gradual road to top if you want to avoid stairs.I visited here at the end of September this year and in October of last year. I went to see the pink Muhly grass and the silver grass. It was pretty but not as full at the end of September thus I recommend going in October as I went last year - the silver grass was blooming then at that time. Overall, nice views from up there. One time we hiked up, the other time we took the trolly ride. It costs 3,000 won one way. Avoid going on the weekend, if you can, as it is packed then. Weekdays are much better."

We arrived just after the museum opened at 9 and we were the only ones there. The entrance fee for adults is 6,000 won and it’s free for kids under 5. The museum was fairly standard for a natural history museum. There was a section on dinosaurs, beautiful rocks, cool insect displays, live fish and insects, some stuffed animals, evolution, fossils, etc. Overall, it’s a nice museum and good for a couple hour visit. There is a cool looking slide outside, but it was raining while we were there so we didn’t use it. While we were finishing up at the museum several school groups arrived. I recommend getting there early in order to avoid the school groups. There was a snack shop at the museum and also a small gift shop. We got off at the Gajwa metro station and took a taxi from there. It would be a bit of a ways to walk from the metro station plus there is a steep hill going up to the museum.We went all the family, my kids are 5, 12 and 15. They really enjoyed but the only problem that nearly everything is in Korean. But it was not the big problem, the like the Dinos and earth development I truly recommend to go, specially if you have childrensWe went yesterday with my 3 kids (5, 12 and 15). Was really fun but I don put 5 stars because nearly everything was in Korean. For the little one is no a problem because he enjoying mostly looking but the others are different. The app for the mobile so good for kids!If yours kids likes Dinos is super fun. Very interesting the earth environment. You can spend about 2 hours and it's a very good price.this museum is so good for adults, young and kids. its about dinosaurs and plants and how human beings lived before. must visit for nature loversIt was smaller than we thought it would be but it did not disappoint! We have a 2 and 3 year old and they liked it. Not an all day trip though. 3 hours max.I have seen many Natural History Museums and this is for sure not the largest but the rock and minerals collection displayed here is absolutely outstanding. Seoul has a lot to offer tourist, so depends on the time available to you and your interests; you may consider visiting Seodaemun Museum. There is no subway station near the museum and you will have to walk up/down hill for about 10 min to reach the Bus Stop. You can also take a taxi which is usually at a reasonable cost in Seoul.This structure and museum is like a step back in time for Korean heritage and culture. It is very beautiful here, especially around fall and/or spring. After a short trip to this museum, you can easily go around the corner and you will be in a very central location to shop, eat, etc.Although a relatively small museum (three floors) for natural history, the facility has a wealth of exhibits and visual fodder to keep young ones occupied. A lack of English description limits a full appreciation of the content, but a good and cheap ($3) way to spend a couple hours.This museum is tucked away and hidden from regular traffic, but don't expect that to mean it'll be empty. The adult fee is a reasonable 3,000 won. There are lockers on the main floor for you to store bags or coats. The museum is not large enough to get lost in, so you don't need to pick up the offered brochures unless you want a keepsake of your trip. All the displays are in Korean, so if you are a foreigner who doesn't speak the language, this is really just a look-through trip as opposed to anything educational. (I'm perfectly fine with those myself.) Worth the trip if you have a free day and no idea what to do.CYC(2013.2)There were three floors. The first was Human & Nature Hall and Central Hall, and the second was Life Evolution Hall, and the third was Earth Environment Hall. There were many animals, plants, and miniatures. But if you go there, you'll be not that easy to find there because it is in the middle of residential area. But if you go there, you'll be surprised. Because the miniatures are so full of life."

삼성 딜라이트,148건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 서초구 서초대로74길 11 Connected to Line 2 Gangnam Station exit 8,12위(285곳의 서울 소재 즐길 거리 / 게임 중),"We heard about Samsung d'light from a family member. An easy place to find and get to. Just get out at Gangnam metro station and head towards exit 8. The retail-exposition type experience has a retail shop on the ground floor, an interactive experience on the first floor and a showcase of living technology on the 2nd floor. It's designed to give us a look at the near future at home, at school and in the workplace. Unfortunately, we arrived at the same time as about 2 dozen local schoolchildren who monopolised the VR headsets and other interactive displays. Staff members were not that helpful apart from the ladies who initially greeted us showing us how to access the interactive area. Other staff completely ignored us when we tried to access the VR gear. Perhaps it's simply luck of the draw.We really enjoyed our visit to this corporate enterprise and were able to spend a couple of hours enjoying the various attractions that were on offer. The fact that the place is free and gives one a glimpse of what Samsung think the future will look like was entertaining and interesting. Staff were on-hand to make sure you enjoyed the experience and a follow-up e-mail from Samsung with photos etc. was also a little unique. We visited at the end of a day's sight-seeing- it was great way to finish off what had been a very busy day.This type of store is the future of retail. So many experiential interactions and retail as well. Many floors of different things to see and experienceAmazing experience. And at NO charge! Brilliant VR and loads of interactive stations. Very clever. Massage chairs a highlight!!!This places is brilliant. You have your photo taken and it’s put on the wall, then you get given a wristband with your photo inside it.. you then move to different areas and scan your wristband to play that particular area, could be changing your picture, making a planet etc.... if your in the area go and try itIt was very easy to get to the building (2min from Gangnam station) and the exhibition is large covering three floors. On the first floor they have phones, laptops, and tablets you can play with. They also have a 4D VR experience which is amazing and a must. The rest is all kinds of electronics from fridges and vacuums to prototypes of massage chairs (yes, you can try them) and facial masks. On the second floor they have an interactive exhibit about emotions and machine learning - you can register a bracelet and go around the various stations receiving a report about your preferences and emotional state at the end. They have other VR stations here too. The third floor was the most interesting for me - it was the home of the future where Samsung showcases their vision of how machines will ease our lives and integrate with our homes. We spent about 1.5hrs there (40min just on the massage chairs). Definitely worth the trip.Amazing to see what is heading our way especially being ftom NZ.Everyone friendly so dont be shy to ask to try things. The VR jumping off a building was awesome. No entrance fee or fees to try things.Fridges, Washington machines and cooktops of the future are all here on display, together mith massive tvs, all showing what it will be like in the future. For me the massive washing machine, which does everything auto a tic, except putting the washing in.It.determines the fabric, the water temperature, the washing powder etc. and sms you when it is finishedCan easily spend a couple of hours by looking and getting a feel of all the experiences offered here. It presents a futuristic view of the World and all the potential technologies, digital and AI that Samsug is working upon and may well be a reality in the years to come. You can enter the the Samsung buliding with the exit pointed to Samsung Electronics from Gangnam station. From outside its just across Gangnam square.The experience section is on the upper level and the basement has the samsng shop where you can purchase products. Dont miss the VR experience, I had the roller coaster ride and it was adrenaline pumping.Don't bother visiting this place. There are far better things to do with your time in Seoul. The only mildly amusing part is the virtual reality experience at the end - and even that was just mediocre."

After exiting the toll-gate, there is a lift at the end of the floor to take you to the street level. Turn left and then right to enter Under Stand Ave. There is a good eating shop on your left. Cross the road to enter Seoul Forest. Last year, the autumn colours were stunning but because of the long summer and dryness this year the ginkgo and maple trees were somewhat disappointing. It is still a good place to walk.Huge garden with performances on some days, without which, there isn't much to see. A lot of green and few flowers when we visited in early October. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to visit this place. There are more scenic nature walks closer to the city.I went to Seoul forest to enjoy the weather with a friend. the place was really nice, we almost forgot that we were right in the center of Seoul. the weather was perfect and the leaves in the orange color of autumn were perfect. short a good time, I recommend this park.Wonderful place to spend a beautiful day. There are tons are walking paths and benches. The park is filled on the weekend. You can rent bikes and ride around the perimeter of the park. There is a lot of shade.I visited Seoul and really enjoyed the time with my friends. We stayed in the capital for 2 nights and explored some famous sites there: Gyeongbokgung Palace, Bukchon Hanok Old Village, Seoul Stadium... shopping at Myeongdong was a must and tasted street foods there which would give us happy time for the trip.A great place to walk around and enjoy some space from the hustle and bustle of Seoul. A very child friendly environment.It's an oasis in Seoul. Walking in this park/mini forest really makes you think you're out in the country side. It's very relaxing and enjoyable. Many attraction for kids as well. Great for outdoor activities.Came here for a walk with our toddler, and had lots of fun. A great big playground, a little corner with some water-themed equipment nearby. Deer feeding was prohibited, not sure if permanent or temporary... Large territory to explore with lots of pretty views and photo opportunities. Not sure it's a good option as a tourist destination, but if you want to spend some time with kids in a park and explore the territory, then it's the place to go.There are 2 subway stations nearby the park. one is green line and the other is yellow if i'm not mistaken. I think the yellow line is nearer than the green line. This park is not so crowded, we came around 6.30 pm and had a great time enjoying cherry blossom.We visited Seoul Forest early to feel the morning breeze since the temperature when we visited was still around 9deg. As the name implies, it is a big place. There are so many areas to visit but it takes a lot of walking to reach each part. And some directions won’t lead you to what is indicated. The only area we enjoyed most was the Tulip Garden where flowers are in bloom and in different happy colors. There are even cherry blossom trees in between. It felt refreshing and very calming. If you are a nature lover, you can try and visit Seoul Forest."
청계천 박물관,15건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 성동구 청계천로 530 (우) 04704,231위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"Tells the story of the history of the Cheonggyecheon ""stream"" which is an iconic landmark in Seoul. With old maps and many old photos it traces its history from the 15th century to the present day. How it had been covered up and subsequently uncovered. Don't miss the portion of the original wooden stilt housing just across the road.Free to enter and easily reached by Metro and then a short walk.If you are interested in urban history or urban development, this museum is absolutely a great place to learn about how Cheonggyechong changed in the past decade. It includes the historical meaning of the river, as well as the social issues happened due to the economic boom after WWII and the detail of restoration of the river. Personally, I love this museum a lot as I can learn a lot about this amazing renewal project in Korea. Although Korean is still the main language in the museum, some important places would also have Japanese, English or Chinese explanation.This is totally off the beaten track but is a medium sized museum overseen by the Seoul History Museum but which focuses solely on the Cheonggyecheon River--its role in Seoul's history and the amazing story of its restoration to become the center piece of Seoul's ""greening."" The Museum is set up beautifully with you starting at the top of the Museum and working your way through history to the present at the bottom. That is suppose to represent the flow of the stream downhill. Great photos of Seoul in the past and all is in English for easy understanding. I visited the main Seoul History Museum also--and found this one to be much easier to understand and much more interesting. Few tourists make it here but was worth my time! Would recommend over the main History Museum. Its free too!The Cheongyecheon Museum is a wonderful look at the important role the Cheongyecheon area played in Seoul's development. It also offers insight into the political environment that influenced the redevelopment of Cheonggyecheon. The pictures from the 1880's were fantastic. All of the displays translated to English. Outside of the Museum is a mockup of a shanty town that is a great back drop for memorable pictures. The Museum is free and on a hot day is a nice cool excursion.The museum isn't near the ""headwaters"" of the stream where most people go, but it's worth visiting if you have time. Or sign up for the #2 option in the City of Seoul's free walking tours and visit then (that's what we did). There is also a replicated shanty town example at this site. The section of stream in this area is more rustic and also worth walking along for the different perspective it provides.There is the main building of the Cheonggyecheon Museum with a lot of display and educational videos shown and opposite of the museum are the old houses of Cheonggyecheon.Seems like no one knows about this place. My friend and I wandered around for approximately two hours and saw only one other person.This fantastic free museum is dedicated to the re establishment of the Cheonggyecheon Stream that runs east to west through the heart of Seoul. The stream had been covered/filled in during the late sixties and an elevated expressway put over it. More than the story of the stream, this museum tells the story of Seoul and how the stream and the people of this city, their fortunes and misfortunes are linked. It talked about life before and after Japanese colonialism. The hardship of WWII very brief elation following liberation then the terrible years of the Korean War. The resulting mass waves of refugees and crushing poverty that lead to shanty towns lining the Cheonggyecheon. The museum goes on to look at the dismantling of these settlements. The forced re homing of communities to ""moon villages"" on the out skirts of Seoul. Of riots and civil unrest.This museum is so much more than a mere look at a marvel of engineering... Which is what the resurrection of the stream is. It was the best insight into the recent history of Seoul and Korea that I've found here during my stay. A look at all this country has achieved in seventy very short years.It's a little out of the way (being at the non glittery end of the Cheonggyecheon). But so worth the effort of finding it.and a half"

북한산 국립공원,"1,072건의<U+00A0>리뷰",서울 성북구 보국문로 262 (우) 02700,2위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"Easy when it is at the beginning part of the mountain. However, it gets really steep and quite dangerous when reaching the summit of the mountain. Do get proper hiking equipment such as hiking shoe as sport shoe is too slippery. Spend 4 hours going up, and 4 hours down. Never climb down during the evening as it gets really dark and dangerous. Overall it was a great experience, would definitely want to go back again.Don't be fooled by the casual demeanour of the Korean hikers, and the neatness and cleanliness of their equipment. If you get up into the peaks of Bukhansan you may find yourself descending a cliff with only a steel cable or an iron bar to hold on to. Safety ropes are for sissies and westerners, apparently. But it is beautiful to be out among nature (but solitude is not guaranteed, you may find yourself in a throng of Korean hikers). I strongly recommend October to see the red maple leaves, so different than the North American maples. Some parts are accessible by subway (Dobongsan and Mangwolsa stations) and others by bus. Anything you need before (such as lunch or a forgotten item of clothing or equipment) or after the hike (such as food and beer) can be purchased between the subway stations and the mountain.Een van ‘s werelds populairste hiking trails is Bukhansan Mountain.Dit is een prachtig berglandschap, vlot te bereiken met het openbaar vervoer vanuit Seoul. Het meest uitgelezen tijdstip voor zijn beklimming is oktober tot november, vermits de herfstkleuren het landschap dan in een schilderachtig tafereel omtoveren.Er zijn meerdere trajecten mogelijk, doch de mooiste tocht is deze van Bukhansanseong Fortress tot aan Baegundae, de hoogste piek. Een pittige wandeling waarbij het laatste deel zelfs wat avontuurlijk is. Om de steile paden te beklimmen zijn de staalkabels die aan de rand van het pad gespannen zijn een welkome hulp. De fenomenale uitzichten van op de top maken de inspanning meer dan waard. Als het meezit met de smog krijg je een uitzicht over heel Seoul en omstreken. Wauw.Afdalen kan je langs de andere zijde van de berg, langs de oude stadsmuren. De tocht neemt zonder pauze zo’n 5uur in beslag.One of the world's most popular hiking trails is Bukhansan Mountain.This is a beautiful mountain landscape, easily accessible by public transport from Seoul. The most suitable time for his ascent is October to November, since the autumn colors transform the landscape into a picturesque scene.Multiple routes are possible, but the most beautiful trip is from Bukhansanseong Fortress to Baegundae, the highest peak. A tough walk where the last part is even more adventurous. To climb the steep paths, the steel cables that are tensioned at the edge of the path are a welcome help. The phenomenal views from the top make the effort absolutely worthwhile. If there is not too much smog you get a view of the entire Seoul area. Wow.You can descend on the other side of the mountain, along the old city walls. The trip takes about 5 hours without a break.Easy to get to the start of the hike via metro and bus (Gupabal station, line 3, exit 1 followed by 704 bus). I did the gorge path up which I understand to be slightly more difficult. Yes it was tough going, but so worth the experience at the top. I went at 8am on a Monday morning so there were very few other hikers. The most worthwhile day in Seoul!Let me get this straight, I'm not a climber and I haven't been to the gym in over 3 years. I have a decent staminia though. Not having a fear of heights was also helpful in my case.When visiting Seoul last summer, I decided to climb Baegundae peak because ... why not?I was wearing shorts, stockings and $5 primark shoes which were almost falling apart: perfect climbing gear, right? I was smart enough to pack 2L of water and lunch though. I went on a Monday I believe around 9:30 AM. The park ranger was super kind to me, but he made fun of my shoes lmao. He provided me with a map and drew a route for to climb. The first 1,5 hours up were AWFUL. I'm sure ANY other way up would have been better, but I spent the first 1,5 hours climbing uneven, very high stairs and it was almost bad enough for me to quit. During this period I only passed a couple of other people, which was really odd to me, since in other people's reviews I read that the hike is always busy.I started at the Jeongneun parking lot and made my way up to Youngchusa. This part is in the middle of the forrest and this is the part where I was just doing nothing but climbing stairs. I passed Daeseongmun and Bogungmun and this part was super nice, literally like taking a walk in the park. I decided to continue. The forrest ended and very suddenly I was confronted with how high up I was as I was on the edge of a cliff. It was very intimidating at first, but I soon got an adrenaline rush and was excited to make my way up. The next part I spent climbing on all fours over huge rocks and pulling myself up. I didn't find this hardly as draining as climbing the stairs though, and it was honestly very fun. The view from Baegundae peak is kinda unreal and it was really relaxing to sit down and eat my lunch. The locals were also super nice to me and pulled out their best english skills to have a conversation with me: why are you alone? Why are you wearing these shoes? The park ranger had told me to make my way back down to Ui-dong, which I think took me about 1,5 hours. The climb down was really nice and I came across a small shop, where I purchased some more water. There was also a traditional-style restroom which is not for the squeamish, but hey, I had to go after drinking all that water. After arriving in Ui-dong, my very sweaty self made her way back to the nearest subway station and went back to Hongdae.Over all, the walk was really nice after it was more than just climbing stairs. The view is beautiful and the adreneline rush is real. Not sure how difficult it is, since I haven't done a lot of hiking in my life, but for someone with average stamina it's deffos do-able.A would say you need to have decent decent footwear and I recommend padded/gripped gloves as well. In the later parts of the hike you have to climb over boulders and pull yourself up smooth rock whilst holding onto a wire rope. Gloves certainly made it easier. The views from the top are amazing, some of the best views of Seoul, and it really gives a scale of how big the city is. The down side though is getting there is a chore. The subway station that is closest is still bus ride away, and its a very popular route and you will be waiting a very long time to get on the bus. I decided to walk to the entrance to the park, which I would not recommend. Also there are multiple routes to the top, and I couldn't find any kind of visitor centre at the bottom to get a map.So when you start heading up there is no way of knowing if your are going up a harder route or an easy route. And in fact since the routes criss cross its very easy to go a much longer route. Also the ascent is mostly covered by forest so you really don't appreciate your altitude. The first time you come out of the forest you look out over a cliff and it really hits you hard. I'm not scared of heights but that sudden look over a cliff face still came as a shock. I would say its a reasonably tough climb as well. I wouldn't recommend trying to climb this unless you hike regularly.It was really gorgeous. I love walking around and drowning in the beauty of nature. Fresh air and nice weather thouIts amazing that older Koreans of 60+ age can climb the Bukhansan mountain with ease. The climb is quite steep and rocky. The trails are not always that clearly marked out. You definitely need good hiking shoes and walking sticks will also be a great help. Don't forget to bring food and water. You can fill your water in streams on some of the trails. Toilets are few, far and minimal. Its something different to do in Seoul if you are fit for the climb.If you like to hike, or simply take a long walk in nature while staying in Seoul, this could be the answer for you. Quite near the city . Nice views. You should bring along comfortable hiking shoes.Plan a half day; bring a snack/lunch.We are a family of four with two children (4,7). We started hiking up towards Baegundae Peak, however with the 2 kids we made it with in about 1.5k from the top. My 7 year old was fine, but my 4 year old had to be carried by daddy the further we went up. The hike was just lovely...wonderful smells, fantastic views, the nature was just gorgeous. We hiked about 4.5 hours with my kids. Stopped for lunch break (brought lunch) half way. Even if you don’t hike, I think the park is definitely something to visit to leave the hustle and bustle of the city."

롯데월드타워&몰,762건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 송파구 올림픽로 300 롯데월드 117-123층 (우) 05551,14위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"easy to arrive with local public transportation.plan your visit, eve if you olny want to see the view, try to visit the play area and walk arround ' worth the timeI am puzzled by the review I just read. I thought this was a great observation deck, and they spoke English very well. They answered all of my questions. And most observation decks I have been to have very few elevators. And some sort of wait. It took all of 10 minutes to get to the top for us, and it started out with a bang. The digital wall reveal is amazing. The outside deck was scary fun. All of the electronic assists, in letting you know what you are looking at was great techA bit on the pricier side, but still cheaper than The Empire State Building or 30 Rock.1. the mall is like any big mall in Korea, nothing special I think2. my review is about the tower:positive: - outstanding View from the 117th to 121th floor, about 500m -> for that 1 point negative:- expensive, adult 26000 Won per person - it took more than 70 min to get upstairs, all the procedures like security scan, taking photos to sell them later, just endless waiting in several rooms without a window, the air condition was turned on in stand by modus, there was just simply not enough refreshing cool air coming out of the aircon, nobody of the staff cared, you just were pushed through all the rooms like a herd of sheepThere were no information about the waiting time. If i had knew that then i would have paid the fast check in ticket which costs 50000 Won.This is outrageous expensive but in retrospect worth it. Of course first of all you must afford this price. Everyone who is able to do it should do it because when you stand in the queue for about 50 min and you see the fast tracker who paid more because they <U+201E>knew“ and they are passing through the middle line to the elevator then the damn legs are hurting even more and you are still not in the elevator. Because they skip the queue, the waiting people have to wait longer, maybe your spot in the elevator was taken by one of the high payers.- show room was closed - the outside terrace was closed- the service and the staff processes have to optimize a lot I think- started at the end of the queue at 16.30, to see the Sunset. We arrived round about 17.45 in the 118th floor. Then it was dark night. The windows are reflecting the inside light so the pictures you make are always with co-displayed with people around you- downstairs same procedure: another QUEUE, the second one. A little bit faster downstairs, round about 45min, but still too much time lost. The sightviewing floors are big enough, there was no hustle, so the main problem was the ONE and ONLY elevator (of obviously 2) which was opened for the mass of visitors.- the 2 walk with bottom glas view are not that impressive because you know you are standing on glas, all the floor glasses are full of scratches- in the queue: NO SITTINGConclusion: Lack of process optimization. Great view but just go there when you have enough time and air in your lungs or enough money in your pocket to buy you a fast lane ticket! Go there early enough to see the city by daylight and take some pictures without reflecting of the night indoor lights.Prepare it to the Eiffel Tower in Paris it isnt that irritating like in Lotte Tower or the Empire State Building in N.Y., there are timeslots there and you can buy the tickets simply online, in english! My opinion!To the operators: this stay (2019) in Seoul we decided to stay at Park Hyatt Hotel but we had also considered the Signiel Hotel. The best view was the most important factor in this years hotel choice. Next year, i do travel to Korea once a year because of my family, it won’t be the Signiel again. For sure!Standing on a glass floor on one of the tallest buildings in the WORLD was a tad scary but so worth it. Views of the city and surrounding hills were grand while the sun was setting.I can rave on all I like about being 123 stories and 480 odd metres in the air but unless you go up you won't ever appreciate just how cool the vies of the nightlights and the view of the Han River are.If you visit with your Discover Seoul Pass you will get a small discount going up the tower, but price is not unusual for any other attraction such as this in other parts of the world. We paid EUR 19 per person and it was far more entertaining with the laser light show and the LCD display screens. Once you get up to the top via the elevator you can go higher up using the escalators as there are 3 more viewing floors. Coffee shop and sweet shop available. Sadly the air quality was not good when we went so visibility was not optimal, very hazy. The mall itself was fun with lots to see and play with. Fancy shops and I did not feel bored.Visited the Lotte Sky Tower this week. Arrived by Metro and entered the site via the street level because I wanted to see the tower from the outside and take pics. When I left to go back to the metro I didn't have to go to the street level. There is a connecting tunnel, but don't ask me how to find it, I just followed the signs for a long while. Anyway, the ticket office is actually in the ""basement"" (floor # 1BF?) / Metro station level. There are lots of shops in the 1BF level so it took a minute to find it. Then, it costs about $25 bucks to go up. I received a 10%(?) discount for using a Visa card, but that was just an unplanned bonus. There are a few corridors you have to navigate before you get to the elevators. The walls and ceiling are constantly flashing images so it's a little disconcerting but I guess entertaining if one were stuck in line. Once you get to the top, you are at the 117th floor (start of observation area). I will admit this whole visit was well executed and planned, the ""reveal"" is amazing and everyone did go ""oooh"" collectively haha. Great views obviously since you are so high up. The glass floor is cool. There is this whole photo spots pre-planned package thing that I opted out of since I brought my own camera, so I'm not sure how much that costs (if anything, maybe it was free?) There are various cafes and such as you wander between floors 117th - 120th. The elevator down is on 120th floor, and there is a line, but it went pretty fast. Overall, kind of a check the box kind of thing IMHO, but I personally feel the view from N Seoul Tower at Namsan is way better. From Lotte Tower, you can see the Han River, bridges, mostly apartment buildings, and most of southeast Seoul, but overall, not worth $25 IMHO.I went there at night - seeing Seoul late at night was a nice experience. The glass floor in the two spots give you some thrills but its a nice sensation! Definitely go!Accessed from inside the train station this is a really great Tower experience. Out of the 4 we experienced in South Korea this was easily the best. A couple of staged photo shots then up in the super fast elevator. Once at the viewing level you soon realise there are escalators taking you higher and to various shops and cafes etc. Glass floor part is cool and all in all it was really good.You need at least one day to leisurely walk around each of the buildings and look at the shops and the amusement park. Gangnam is an impressive area ..WOW!"
올림픽 공원,700건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 송파구 올림픽로 424 (우) 05540,36위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"The park is easily accessible by subway (Mongchontoseong Station) on Line 8, near Jamsil. It is a large park with beautiful scenery. The best is to go there in the afternoon, take the path on the right and then walk anti-clockwise around the park. The alternative subway access is the Olympic Station (P550) but there is a lot walking to do ie from there to walk around the park to Mongchontoseong station.I love the Olympics and have visited a number of Olympic cities over the years. How they use the park after the games varies a lot from country to county. Here in Seoul it was good to see the park so busy and well used although turning the former Olympic stadium into an O2 type venue has obviously helped. The Olympic gate and flame were worth seeing.This is a nice park now and it has lots of very modern sculptures. It could be a pace for a bit of respite from busy Seoul.Easy to see on an electric scooter that can be hired in and around the park. None of the sporting venues are accessible to the public for a look in, but they are still standing. There is a Flag Plaza that is also a legacy of time as well as the Olympic Flame.take water it's a large park to visit. if you're up to a work out, walk uphill around the remains of an old fortbest part were the flags / olympic flame and the rose garden.off season without events, only the gate areas have food and beveragesVery cozy park. The facilities of the Olympics are still beautiful and modern. I also found the names of the Hungarian Olympic champions on the board of glory..I highly recommend it for a full day outing!Grulla, full, of people , what i liked is the gastronomic food that it has, mostly sea food, But its to crowdedOne of the places that we visit. My nephew loved it because he can run around. Quite far from our hotel, but reachable by train.This park is very relaxing and goo to spend a lazy time. I think Olympic Park is one of the most peaceful park in Seoul.- Close fom metro line #8 Mongchon Toseong(closer from main entrance) and #5 Olympic Park. - With mounds, tall trees and other installations, it's also good for a photoshoot.- Also, there are stadiums for events and sport games.- In late September, they have Hanseong Baekje Cultural Festival near Peace Gate. It is not to miss.- There's a pretty nice Korean buffet in the park. Good to try.- Lots of magpies.The place around the olympic park is really nice. There are a lot of festivals in this area and its easy to reach."

롯데시네마 롯데월드,33건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 송파구 잠실동 40-1,25위(285곳의 서울 소재 즐길 거리 / 게임 중),"I wanted to see the first, opening night of ""The First Man"" whilst in Seoul and decided to go to the Lotte Cinema to watch it. The concierge in my hotel made my reservation (using her own credit card to book on line) and I then picked up the ticket at the theatre once having established on which floor my particular screen was located. I tried printing out the ticket from one of the machines using the booking number but wasn't successful. No problem. The friendly young ladies at the ticket desk found my booking and issued my ticket for me.The screen itself was what you'd expect in any such modern complex. Excellent sound, picture quality, comfortable seats with plenty of legroom. The only annoying thing was the constant chomping of popcorn in my ears from all angles.I came here to try their Lotte Super S at auditorium 13, where it already using Samsung Cinema LED Screen. One word: perfect!!! Can't say more as I really enjoy when watching, at that time the show was Pacific Rim: Uprising. Totally recommended.Not only do you have a plethora of choices of which movies to watch, but you can also choose one of the many, many types of theaters! Are you claustrophobic and need more wiggle-room while watching a movie? Then fear not! The Charlotte Theater is available at Lotte World Tower’s theater! This room is quite a bit more expensive than the more standard rooms at W35,000 per ticket, but it’s more of a special occasion luxury. Besides the Charlotte room, there are other large screens with 4D, 3D, 2D and all with state-of-the-art surround sound. Be sure to check out the various popcorn flavors as well! (The Cheetos popcorn was a hit for us!)Yesterday evening I bought a 30,000W ticket to Lotte World Cinema 16, a small theater in Lotte World Mall. This was to see the February 28th 2017 film of the performance of the Royal Ballet's Sleeping Beauty. Cinema 16 was appropriately air conditioned ans cool but the cinema has an overpowering very bad stink of dampness/mould combined with the smell of a room that has had many people in it with no clean air Ugh!!! I was still noticing the bad smell at the end of the 3 hour film!Prior to the film I sought help from the staff (in perfect English) at the theater information counter on the 5th floor which was excellent. I needed to know the quickest way to get back to the no 8 subway line as I wanted to ensure I caught the last train back to Yeoju after the film. The young lady accompanied me up the the 8th floor, showed me the location of the elevators that went directly to B1 (the level of no2 and no8 subway lines) in relation to where I would exit cinema 16. She also made sure I knew to turn right and follow the signs to subway line 8 when I got to B1. I was very impressed and most grateful for the excellent customer service!Cheap tickets, friendly atmosphere, clean chairs equipped with side tables for convince, wide leg space, my family loved it, am living in one of the most expensive cities and I go to movies weekly but this cinema showed me different experience, it would be nice after finishing the movie to have a snack from small cafe near to the cinema called Azabu, fresh custard pies with cup of hot coffee would make ur day.Been here like 3 times already. Very modern theater. I'm a movies lover so i may go again in the futureNice new movie theaters. Weekday mornings, first sessions are 6,000 KRW(approx.5.5USD). If you have hotel nearby, it might be good local experience to go to local cinema. All movies are sub titled in Korean, over the original sound(It is not dubbed). For kids movies, there are 2 kinds, one for orignal sound with Korean sub, another is Korean dub. If you go with kids, better to check which one is original sound. Weekday morning sessions are easy to get the ticket at 5th floor, ticket box but weekend morning sessions are sometimes full with online booking.We were tired because we shopped all day and wanted to catch a movie. We decided to see a movie and was concerned because there might not be English movies but there were! A very nice lady spoke decent English and helped us choose our movie, movie time and even ran after us with our change. The price for to tickets for Deadpool was 16,000KRW and I paid with a 50,000KRW and she ran after us with our change. The theater seats were very comfortable and to top it off the movie was very entertaining. For a nice experience in a Korean Theater try checking out Lotte Cinema and you can’t go wrong with the cheap ticket.i love the wall inside the cinema as they have wallpaper. it is a pleasant feeling and very few people inside the cinema.this is on the 6th floor of the Lotte Department store,so you have to take the lift in the store to reach the entrance.when you get there you can expect more or les the same as your local multiplex,showing roughly the same films.Godzilla was the main attraction whilst i was there."
석촌호수,84건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 송파구 잠실로 148 (우) 05608,54위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"The lake is very popular in spring with its cherry blossoms. In autumn it is a lot quieter. Walking around the lake at night is very relaxing. Getting to the lake is quite easy by subway. Just get off at Jamsil Station and take Exit 2 (of the subway). Turn left a bit and cross the road. That takes you to Exit 1 of the Express Bus Terminal; there is a small walkway down to the left side of the lake. If you cross the road to the opposite side, it is Exit 2 of the Express Bus Terminal; a small walkway on the side takes you to the right side of the lake (with the Lotte fun park). To the first timer, it can be confusing after getting out of Exit 2 (of the subway) to see another Exit 2 after you cross to the opposite road corner.This park is a must to visit in Spring! It is accessible by train, we alighted the station near the Lotte World Mall and had our lunch first. Flowers blooming everywhere and cover the whole Lake. We also can see the Lotte World Theme Park from the park. We spent walking around 1 hour to cover the whole lake - there are 2 sides of the lake.The cherry blossom trees covered the whole Seokchon Lake, go there early to avoid the crowd if you want to take pictures. Seokcho Lake is situated next to Lotto Shopping Mall.Remember to bring extra warm jacket because the lake is windy and cold during spring.Went there during lunch hour, very crowded. But the view of the lake with cherry blossom is fantastic and Romantic. You can also view the Lotte tower next to it. Don’t miss this if you go to that area.If you will be in Seoul around Apr, this place is a must see.Full of cherry blossom!! Very romantic and beautiful!At Songpa-gu, Seokchon Lake, a must visit to the Songpa Naru , the 1000 meters path around the lake side , with arrays of cherry blossoms along both side of the path. To visit during the evening time - another exotic experience to view the blooming flowers. Also, to see the scenic view of 120 floor Lotte World Tower at night time.Beautiful scenery with cherry blossom tree around the lake. Very crowded and better to come earlier. Lotte world theme park with a castle makes it more beautiful like fairy tales. There is a cafe inside. One of the top must visit during spring season in Seoul.Early April untill 11st April 2019 National Cherry Blossom Festival (벗꽃축제 beojk-koch-chug-je ) every year is different day please check before come. Next to the highest tower in Korea called ”Lotte world tower” also close by Lotte world I went to the lake on 8 April not too crowded they have some show also the stuff for sale along the lakeside.This is my second time visiting Seokchon Lake. The first time was in June 2017 after Lotte World Tower had been opened to the public. This time, the sakura season was right on and Seokchon Lake is one of the hot spots to view cherry blossoms. I avoided Sunday and went on a Monday, but still there were many people (a week- long sakura festival was on). The flowers there were mostly white. I walked around the east lake, and Lotte World Tower is particularly photogenic with cherry blossoms all around. In the evening, when the lights were turned on, it's another atmosphere.Outside the sakura season, the lake is a nice place to stroll around leisurely.Lovely cherry blossoms during the Festival in April. However, I did think the whole atmosphere was somewhat spoilt by the presence of the Lotte amusement park in the middle of the lake, complete with various park rides!"

Next to the highest tower in Korea called ”Lotte world tower” also close by Lotte world (amusement park) I went to the lake on 8 April not too crowded they have some show also the stuff for sale along the lakeside.About:It has two lakes with Songpa-daero Boulevard running in between them, and a jogging course and walking trails along the lakes. The depth of the lakes is 4-5 meters approx. The park now serves as a great place for Seoul citizens to relax but it a good place for foreigners too. Tips:You can view many other attractions too in a day in Jamsil.First you can visit the lake, then Lotte World Amusement Park then At night Lotte World Mall.If you plan to go in winter wear not only warm clothes but gloves as its a lake and wind becomes really cold & chilly.The sun sets pretty early in winter so if you wana enjoy great views then go in day light.Great park for a walk. Beautiful trees around the area. The lotte world tower is part of the landscapevisited this place at the right time and saw the very long rows of Cherry Blossom extending across the whole Lake. this is behind Lotte World Amusement park walking distance from Jamsil StationThis place seems like home to me...i visit at least once a week while enjoying a cup of coffee from one of the MANY coffee shops that are lined up along the lake...Seoul is a busy and fast paced city but it's nice to have a park to stop and chill outLocated behind Lotte World in Jamsil, Seoul, Seokchon Hosu Park is composed of two man-made lakes wherein the western part contains Lotte World's outdoor counterpart, Magic Island. The best time to visit is April-May, during the height cherry blossoms season. The big plus is that it's not as crowded as Yeouido Park during those times. Running track surfaces are laid along its banks where hundreds of cherry trees are located along side the path. Great for jogging or just a leisurely stroll. It's also conveniently located beside Lotte World Hotel, Lotte Department Store and Lotte World Tower."

There's a guy who rents tents out to people, the little ajummas are basically waiting for you to come out of the subway so they can sell you delicious fried chicken, beer, soju, maekgoli, or tteokbokki... bring your appetite! We got some drinks, walked down toward the Han River and just picked a spot to watch people. Young, old - everyone was out in the sun and it was a great time outside the hustle of all the markets and sight-seeing.Yeouido Hangang park is a funny and amusement place for both adolescent and the old people. It's much more great at weekends.You can have a really good time here with your friend and spend quality time together. You can have a picnic with bringing your own food or just buy in the stores that provided in this place. You can also rent bike and this place is where the firework festival event for every year.The hangang park stretches for miles along the han river and also passes by Yeouido. The park is enormous in size actually, hard to imagine for a city short of space like Seoul. At the park is a bike trail, running trail etc and one can rent bikes. there are also cafes and restaurants, so making it the perfect destination for an afternoon outdoors. It gets very crowded on weekends however the atmosphere is great.I really, really want to go back and spend a lot of time here since we just take a rush stroll through this park to Cruise Tour by E-Land. We saw lots of food and clothes stalls, people jogging and riding bike, having a picnic and basically spend leisurely time with their family and they looked so happy hahaha. To be honest, one of my travel to-do list is to ride a bike in this park, but we couldn't do that. Will definitely come back for the experience!Hangang Park comes alive weekends in Summer. Thousands of families with shelters and picnic blankets enjoying the free water park. Water is cold, but the kids don't seem to care. There are a couple of convenience stores within the park to provide access to cold drinks and snacks. Great spot to take kids for a couple of hours on a hot afternoon. Good views of the city and bridges over the Han River. Plenty of cycling and walking tracks.My boyfriend and I hired two shopper bikes in Yeouido park. We headed off along Mokpo bridge, along the other side of the river and back across Yanghwa bridge, then back down to the park along the under-road cycle highways. It was a fantastic experience and we really enjoyed the privacy of the cycle highways along with being able to test the outdoor gyms that were dotted along the route. The park itself is lovely apart from the hawkers...the old women shoving flyers for fried chicken in our faces...however you can avoid them once on the actual bikes. The rental was cheap and the bikes worked, that is all I can ask for.I would mainly tell people to get off at yeouinaru station, exit 1, to enjoy hangang park. It's right next to the river and has so many food trucks during the summer time. You could just grab a meal and a few beverages and sit there peacefully as long as you want. Try to go when the sun is setting so that the temperature will be cooler. This has been one of my favorite summer spots and I try to go every weekend during the summer to enjoy the area, people, and food."

CGV 영등포,42건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 영등포구 영등포동 4가 441-10번지 경방 타임스퀘어 4~7층,20위(285곳의 서울 소재 즐길 거리 / 게임 중),"This is nice movie theater complex inside shopping mall. Many restaurants and chances to buy pop corn and other snack. One of the theaters is so called 3D 4DX where you watch movie thru 3D glasses and seats are moving etc. I watched movie Alita, Battle Angel. 3D Alita movie was very good but this moving chair thing not so nice. This time I chose front row with extra legroom which was good. Temperature in the theater was too warm and I started to feel dizzy and uncomfortable similar to shaking city bus. Wind effect was nice. For visitors 4D theater is good to experience once. Personally next time I will pick same movie in 3D but IMAX screen. Overall CGV theater is good and large like one at COEX. Bigger and more spacious and not so many people like in Yongsan CGV. Yeongdeungpo is only some 6km from the city center but atmosphere is more relax. Quite different than Gangnam station area or City center.I've tried 4DX, which meant apart from shaking massage like chair seats, I had water sprayed on me, wind blew on my hair, & things slapped my ankles. Also tried Sphere X which didnt impress me much at first, but after the movie ended, then I realised I was totally immersed, I forgot I was in a cinema. The early morning shows ran around 6-10am, late night shows around 11pm-2am.We've been to many CGV Theatre's all over Korea and they're always super clean, very comfortable seating and plenty of goodies and snacks to choose from. This one was awesome, it's located on the 4th floor in Times Square Mall. Definitely worth a visit especially after walking around this huge mall. Give it a try and I hope you enjoy the movie!A good option and place to catch a movie after a meal. It is conveniently located in Times Square Mall and claimed to have the biggest screen and super sound systems as well as digital images. Given it's great location, we can enjoy some snacks or desserts before watching movie. There is a tiramisu ice cream shop (Kiss The Tiramisu). I had one before the movie. We can also buy some other snacks (perhaps from e-mart) to bring into the theatre while enjoying the movie. Overall, the effect was really good. Good digital images and sound system and the screen was really big enough for us to enjoy the movieNot only is the Starium theater great (claims biggest in Asia) but there are so many places to eat and get snacks from. CJ is the company that owns the CGV theaters so you can bring in food from Twosome Place (cafe) or any of the other food places they own. I had a little breakfast at the Twosome Place on the main CGV level and forgot that there is an awesome more upscale cafe on the 6th floor (starium floor). As far as the CGV food, there was a stand alone hotdog counter, popcorn and ice cream mixed, o'dang on a stick, the normal concession counter with gourmet popcron ( I got smores popcorn). Great theater located in Times Square Mall. If you want something to eat after that isn't theater related, the main entrance to the CGV is the same level as the floor with all the restaurants in the mall.What's not to like about sweet popcorn (we do half sweet-half regular), a coke zero (yes, they actually have it) and a good movie with air-conditioning, comfortable seats, clean bathrooms and a very friendly staff?  Nothing! It was great and I highly recommend it!"
N 서울 타워,"9,336건의<U+00A0>리뷰",서울 용산구 남산공원길 105 (우) 04340,44위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"We brought an infant in stroller and it was smooth to go to the tower through the cable car. However, as we had reserved ticket to the top of observation there was no way for ppl with stroller and ppl said it was repaired so the only way we had to use the stairs which was ridiculous and we had to miss the opportunity and the ticket to go to the top.It was only about $10 to go to the top of the tower. You get a great view, you will see just how huge the city is. You have to check out the urinals in the Mens' room! The best standing view ever!Make sure that you take a bus up the hill. It's a long walk uphill if you don't!!The view from the top of the tower is spectacular. The walk down is pleasant and provides more views. Once down continue to the marketvisited this place before but didn’t appreciated it much because too many people and long lines.. but this visit is so magical, 10am just about it opens, you can appreciate the place and better view, weather also cooperated, bright and clear sky even at a very cold temperature of -4CHonestly loved everything about this place..N-seoul Tower is probably the most beautiful place ive been and I live in NEW ZEALAND..Seoul is my favorite countryWe had a beautiful day here. You could see the whole city from the top. It has super clean restrooms too.The tower offered great views of Seoul, even though it was a smoggy day. Ticketing was easy and relatively inexpensive.Just a warning, we used a bus to get here, and it was a pretty steep (though short) hill to climb from the bus stop to the towerGreat place to have a 360 view of the city. There is usually a long wait so depending on when you get there, you might have to get a ticket and you'll be told the time you can go up.Good place to visit.Suggest a taxi to the cable car station for a great view over Seoul.Just be aware that if you have anyone affected by flashing lights they might not want to go up the tower.Good post office selling postcards and stamps plus you can mail right away. Remember in SE Asia you have to use the glue stick provided to affix the stamp to the card!Enjoyed our visit and the views.Well, it’s a landmark and yes you should see it but I felt a bit let down as I expected more... it’s not bad, but surprisingly little things to see or do for the schlepp...."
국립중앙박물관,"2,322건의<U+00A0>리뷰",서울 용산구 서빙고로 137 (우) 04383,5위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"This museum is adjacent to the Gyeongbokung Palace, so it's very convenient to visit. There's a cafe in the basement for light refreshments. A comprehensive display of the Joseon Dynasty that lasted for 5 centuries. A pleasant way to spend an afternoon.Wonderful place to visit. Worthwhile experience. Very well explained exhibits and easy to follow explanationsSadly the app crashed and lost my review - good for kids- Timed, free entry for the kids museum, geared for 7 & under but no age limit.- free entry to the permanent exhibit- plenty of parking Recommend!One can easily spend a whole day here. The museum is well planned and layed out. The displays are well lit and presented with excellent information. The main exhibition areas are free (charge for special exhibits) and there are places to eat (museum cafe and museum cafe prices). It's just a really great museum and for the price it's a great way to spend a few hours, or to go back repeatedly (and in summer a way to beat the heat). I used to live in Seoul and would bring people here. I highly recommend this museum.This national museum has an interesting selection of exhibits and isn't so big that you get 'gallery fatigue' when you're only halfway through. The restaurant is good for traditional Korean food at a reasonable price and I found the gifts in the museum shop were attractive and very reasonably priced.You can divide museums into great, and not great. The great museums then can be divided into worth a return visit, and not worth one. The National Museum of Korea is a great museum that is unquestionably worth return visits.First the architecture: a large building divided into smaller units (i.e. children’s museum, library, exhibition hall). The exhibition hall has both permanent and special exhibitions. I only had time (almost three hours) to see the permanent exhibitions on the third and second floors, but didn’t see the first floor or the special exhibition. Regretfully I left my visit to this museum for my last day in Seoul.The exhibitions themselves are of the highest quality, using, among others, collections that were donated or bequeathed to the museum.Physically the exhibition halls are impressive, massively large with high ceilings. The explanatory text is interesting and fully translated to English.There are a few places to eat. I can only comment on the tea room on the third floor where I had an amazingly good cup of tea. There is also an extensive museum shop which is itself impressive. I left some money there, and would have left much more had I lived in Korea and not had to take fragile things on several flights.The main building offerred free admission but don't miss special exhibitions at the library building (with extra fee which was worth the visit). I felt obliged as it was great enough to spend some money to support it. So, I bought some souvenir from the museum shop :) Easy to go there, just take a train to Ichon Station.We visited the museum while staying in Seoul. It is very well laid out and the displays are simply beautiful. Amazing that so much history has been preserved and acquired for people to see.Was particularly pleased to see so many school groups there.So impressive how the museum is organised - you almost feel how it was like to live in ancient times. Need at least a day to do it justice......My wife and I spent a lovely afternoon browsing through both the paid exhibitions (""The Etruscans-Rising to Rome"" and ""Through the Eyes of Joseon Painters"") and the first couple of floors of their free exhibitions.The hours just went by as we strolled through the many galleries, admiring the exhibitions.During my visit, as I was going through the ""The Etruscans - Rising to Rome"" exhibition, 3 boys were left on pretty much on their own and they were running around the exhibition, being a general annoyance. A poor female exhibition staff had a hard time trying to stop those 3 imps. This brings me to my one pro-tip: If you are bringing your kids, and I highly recommend that you do (there is even a children museum), keep them on a tight leash.Anyhow, the museum (inside and outside) is splendid. Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to cover (or at least walk through) all its exhibitions."
더 스파 그랜드 하얏트 서울,21건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 용산구 소월로 322 Garden Level (우) 04347,13위(298곳의 서울 소재 스파 / 웰니스 중),"A hotel of this caliber should not be charging guests such excessive fees to use the spa. Facility is nice and well kept - but is showing its age, and simply just too expensive.Relaxing spa in tranquillity. Love it! The hotel lobby bar has great night view of Seoul! 寧靜的環境，親切的服務，環境乾淨且隱密性高！美療師按的點都有到位，舒緩了運動後的疲勞；而且酒店的大廳有美麗的首爾夜景欣賞；雖然只能搭Taxi or Uber 前往，但非常推薦<U+5594>！As a guest there's no place better to go and spend a few hours 
Great sauna and steam room and giant water bath and scrubbing area
Love it
Gym. Great tooWe took the couples massage treatment. The facilities was clean, relaxing and spacious which was nice. My husband had a massue who was able to find pressure points and had a good massage. Mine on the other hand couldn't, so the massage was OK. The bath tub was circular, and you couldn't really fit 2 people in it. The facials were OK.Great place with wonderful night views, it's very convince that take shuttle bus to Mingdong and airport, if next time I come back, Hyatt will be my first choose.Nice hotel, good amenities, great food. pastries delicious, nice weather and nice beer, easy access. all is accessible only thing is speak korean. alot of nice items and also alot of potential for more people to be the if english is spoken widely. surprise that Malay was spoken as thre are influx of Indonesian.I went to Grand Hyatt Seoul Spa a couple of months ago for massage. You can use the sauna before getting your spa treatment. Also they let you choose the music you want to listen to during your treatment, and choose which beverage and snacks to have after the treatment. The treatment rooms are equipped with personal powder room and bathroom, all very clean. Lighting in the treatment room is very dim and soft. Would love to go there again:)The reason I visited this spa was because i stayed in the hotel. So far, I've visited 5 different spas in Seoul and this spa is probably the most suitable for men and/or business travellers. The decor is modern chic, but not as spacious as other hotel spas. I tried the Ginseng facial and body massage. The quality of the service was good but not extraordinary. Overall the experience was pleasant and relaxing. If I return to the Grand Hyatt Seoul Hotel, I will definitely visit this spa again. You can definitely communicate with the staff in English. The is a busy spa so i recommend you to pre-arrange your appointment."
이태원 랜드,46건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 용산구 우사단로14길 34 (우) 04405,113위(298곳의 서울 소재 스파 / 웰니스 중),"The staff are just delightful. After pointedly ignoring you at the mysteriously named ""service"" desk, they cna't ignore you any longer, and you get a withering glare, the kind of glare that lets you know that they see right through you, and know your exact type, the type of bumpkin low-life foreigner who is defiling their country, corrupting their youth, stuffing up the economy and is the exact reason why Ittaewon is no longer as great as it once was. Its people like YOU who should go back to whichever ""Western"" country you spawned in. People like YOU, who may stay the night, only on condition you are heading to the airport in the morning. People like YOU, the exact reason why our business is going so badly.And don't even think of stealing anything, cos we got our eyes on you, ttongsaeng. Oh, we know. We know you are here because you are low on cash. Its your exact type who would steal. We are watching you, kiddo. And don't. Jump. The. Queue. We have a system and newbies in this country are messing with the harmony. We will attend to you once we finish arguing with these middle-easterners about why we cannot give them a discount from Agoda, basically because we are sick and tired and don't like the look of them. We have a system, and you must follow it, so wait your turn like the rest!Once you survive the ""service"" desk, the standard dungeon baths and free earbuds made out of twigs and recycled Chinese toilet paper follow. You leave feeling quite refreshed after the initial ordeal, and the lamian-making ajjuma on the upper levels is much nicer. She was fat and round and delightful and has the face of someone who had a hard life and a soft heart, and she wished me a delicious meal. She was lovely.After slurping down your lamian from a badly-panelbeaten Chosun-dynasty aluminium bowl in the cool gloom, you explore the actual facilities available. Most are out of order. What is encouraging to see is that the interior appears to have at least been refurbished several times since the Japanese left Korea (the early 20th century, to be clear...not the time before that), and it seems that the last update was done some time in the early or mid 90s.You find there is nothing to really do, you give up and decide its time to sleep. From the enormous pile of neck rests, made from a mixture of what seems to be pulverized concrete and antique fake vinyl that was originally pretending to be fake leather, you pick one that feels that at probably won't slide around too much from its oiliness.Oiliness.A thought occurs. I wonder if...Its too late, and you have already raised the neck-rest to your nose, and take a whiff. An incredible aroma, a new smell you have dreamed of, but in nightmares smashes through your brain. Your senses light up from a truly unique smell, the smell of history, the combined hair-smell of half a century of Itaewon Land patrons. And, oh, why, oh why did I wonder if...?You rationalize that if you don't use a neck-rest, you will wake up with an even worse headache than the normal headache you get from these useless Jimjilbang neck-rests. And anyway, as terrible as it is, it will wash away in the dungeons in the morning.My advice is to suffer the worse jimjilbang headache sans Superfund-site-neck-rest and save yourself some trauma. Because trauma heals only with time, and you will smell that amazing smell in your mind and nostrils for the weeks to come. And when you write your review on Trip Advisor, that smell will return to the front of your mind with extremely high resolution. Trust me, a headache is but a minor pain; hair-smell is everlasting.Dragging your fetid neck-rest out at arms-length, you find it depressingly easy to find a position to sleep in, as the cavernous sleeping area is devoid of human life, and you are reminded that the universe is big and that you are very, very much alone. In Ittaewon Land, no-one can hear you scream: After a heated argument amongst themselves, the Middle-Easterners took Trip Advisor's sage advice and have already taken a taxi to the much friendlier and hygienic Silloam Bulgama Sauna, on the west side of town.I highly suggest this as a place to go if you are low on cash and are really needing to find a place to sleep pronto, and happen to find yourself in Ittaewon at 11PM wondering what to do next. Preferably solo, because friends don't let friends stay at crappy jimjjilbangs. Unless you are with a friend and both low on cash and luck, and its not that close of a friend, then it is cool. You can always make a new, better friend at some other point in life, no?In the morning, the staff are a lot more cheerful, probably because you are on your way, and like most customers, will probably never show your face there again.In such a big, and generally quite hygienic and (kind of) friendly country as Korea, Ittaewon Land is quite a special experience.This is a good place to experience Jjimjilbang culture for the first time.The price isn't that high and humble.- The building is locating on a hill after many steps.- The reception was kind to us.- The facility is old and rusty. But, maintained well.- Even though Itaewon is an area with many foreigners, we have seen many locals during weekday evening.- We had a discount coupon from social web market and it was quite affordable after discount.- They have basic things for jjimjilbang. A snack bar, a massage room, a sleeping room, a common hall, various egloos, hot baths, etc.surpricingly fast ad super serviceminded staff, everyone could communicate in english and every time I went into a new room someone was waiting for me to guide me further on. I almost had it all to myself (11pm-2am) and the massage was perfect. Lots of different activities and saunas, great food and very authentic. Everything was worn and old, but worked perfectly and had personality to it. I recommend. even the staff was all about 60+It is a extremely traditional Korea Spa and massage place. Kinda like those traditional Onsen in Japan. However given the location it feels a little odd to have a facility like this at the busy foreigners hang on area. The oil massage was done by a matured lady but it was actually quite good. Despite I won't say it is cheap and maybe can find better valued alternatives nearby.I had a card that said ""lifetime membership"" that gives me discounts to this place as well as the services within. The man at the counter just took it from me without explaining anything and when I asked he said, ""it's finished."" I said but it says lifetime and it doesn't have an expiration date. He said, "" it's finished because I said it's finished."" Then at the restaurant, they have menus up that you're not able to order from anymore, apparently. But when u ask about it the grouchy lady will just cut u off mid sentence and say, we don't have it. Then when I asked, is it just that item or the entire menu, she walked away. LOLThis isn't a language barrier btw, I'm Korean-American and I do speak semi-fluently. The pic below is a lie...First of all: Korean bath houses have gone a long way from the communities only place to have a shower to today's spa temples they often are. Unfortunately, the Itaewon Land got lost somewhere along the way.The admission is 10.000 Won, but that only includes bathing and a pretty small and simple sauna with a steam room and a dry sauna at about 60°C. If you're looking for a Finnish sauna, you won't find it here.The pools we're poor and far away from state of the art, the water wasn't clean.The staff was unfriendly and would only help if you insist.The food is basic and expensive.Even if you are a foreigner, there are many other bath houses you can go to. There's no need to go to Itaewon Land unless you don't know how to ride a subway.Itaewon Land is a hotel AND a spa. Women and Men are separated. You can find 5 different waterpools (not for smimming). The hotel is extremely clean. And has 24hozrs Restaurant service.Itaewon land holds an imposing position above the thriving nightlife of Itaewon.It's been a bit run down and there are cracks int the tiles indicating it's past it's glory days. But on the other hand it's six bucks for a shower and sauna and for that well,you can't be too fussy. It fitted the purpose so I can say I was satisfied. Further up the hill you can pay 50 bucks to use the Hyatt spa. It's a totally upmarket experience but the result is probably not that far apart physically. So if you want a shower spa and sauna without frills Itaewonland is worth remembering Itaewonland.The Seoul sentral mosque is located in this area, which means many halal food restaurants here. Indian food, Arabian food, Korean food, and others. Most of them are affordable. I remember when I visited Korea in 2010, almost every night I went to Itaewon just to have halal food for dinner. I have not explore the area yet, just visit the Masjid and halal restaurants here.This place is excellent and cheap if you're looking for both a private room and a shared Korean bathhouse experience. I like to stay here when I visit Seoul city as the location is excellent."
이태원,564건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 용산구 이태원동,67위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"Great neighborhood for an evening out and when you feel you’d like a drink and meeting a place where locals and foreigners mix at ease.Many bars to chose from and generally an easy going atmosphere. Worth a visit!Great area, lots of activity and great walking streets. Lots of food options. Safe and clean as is typical in Seoul.many Muslims food. awesome! the subway are so closed to my hotel I stayed. Hamilton Hotel. The people are so friendly.It's a a very nice please and its shops and restaurant with cafe
You can spend 5 , 6 hours
And you can buy to many thingPerhaps it just me. Perhaps today was a Debbie downer in the area. Perhaps the day of the week wasn't right. Perhaps the coin showed Heads instead of tails. Or ... really... perhaps gentrification is starting to set in. It appears to be more of the last one. Went to Itaewon for the first time in 18mths today, and whilst its still a great place, I felt something was a little off about it. Refurbishment is starting to happen, there appear to be more empty shops, Bigger name franchises seem to be occupying more shop space, and with the move of USFK Headquarters to Pyongtaek, the foreign pedestrian traffic has significantly dropped. I understand that the Seoul Metropolitan government has goals for the area. Hopefully they have a positive impact on the area as Itaewon is a great place to go. I guess we will have to wait and see.Had never had a chance to visit Itaewon until recent visit to Seoul.  Packed with shops, restaurants, pubs, and massage, this seems to be the energy center of Seoul.  Fun place to walk around, enjoy a drink and watch people!I have worked in South Korea for 10 years and visited Seoul and in particular Itaewon on a few occasions, for relaxing, shopping, food and nightlife. Each time has been a great experience across the board, however these past few days the experience was much less so.Hotel: Seoul was very busy last week due to events at the olympic stadium and also some sort of demonstrations so most hotels were heavily booked out, so booking as late as I did left little options in the Itaewon area.I chose the Hannam 67 Hotel which is about 1km walk from the Hamilton Hotel. Location was ok, but the hotel was extremely over priced and was pretty much a Korean style ""love hotel"" which are usually ok for a night or 2 but normally run from 60,000kwn to 80,000kwn. This hotel was charging 150,000kwn/night.Room was barely ok, very small, clean but very noisy in the mornings. Bath towels were many years old and had extra large holes in them. I would not stay there again unless no other options.Taxis around Itaewon and Lotte World & Myeongdong areas:Due to so many people in town the taxi drivers were for the most part extremely rude and tried to hold me to ransom on numerous occassions by refusing to use the meter and trying to charge 30,000kwn up front for a 6,000kwn fare! Yet if you walked to an area away from a taxi stand and where there were no people you got the taxi for the correct fare on the meter.Some very greedy taxi drivers around town these days!Business owners would refuse to assist me to try to call taxis even when I offered them my Korean ph to make the call for me.The local Kakao taxi call service was useless if the trip was too short for them to bother.All in all this experience was not what I had come across before. I certainly hope that this type of thing doesn't continue to get worse. Economy is down, businesses are closing and greedy people trying to rip of expats who local economy.I will not be going to to Itaewon, Lotte World or Myeongdong areas again.Disappointed to say the least.Lots to do, walk the streets and window shop. Then find a quaint place and cool off with a drink and some food. We walked up a small hill and found the Thirsty Monk. Reasonable prices, good service, food and drinks! Excellent view of street below!I was quite impressed with this neighbourhood because it had all the makings of a seedy area, but it was lit as far as I could tell. Good bars, high end restaurants, safe atmosphere - yeah, well worth a pub crawl down here again!Itaewon has many halal restaurants and foods... not far from itaewon subway station, you can see line cafe & store. Cute place and many photo spots in here. You should go!"
이태원 앤틱 가구 거리,42건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 용산구 이태원동 (우) 140-200,203위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"Its a place where my mom likes to bring me to walk around. Huge collection from furnitures to antique electronics. You may find some great deals on things that were discontinued decades ago!Antiques galore. There's nothing you can't find if you look hard enough, The whole street is lined with antique stores, and it's a two minute walk from the main street which has restaurants, cafes and clubs.I bumped into these streets in Itaewon during their October Antique week There were nearly 50 merchants on the street showing their wares. I spend a while afternoon walking the stores the next day. Very friendly and very interesting to see how Korea looks at some of our antiques.We were on a business trip so didn't plan on picking up a table and chairs but the shops were great and I love the old stuff . I'm sure like all old places they hike the prices for the Faranges but who cares , Lovely reception in each place no hard sell , even got water in one place. Just down from the Hamilton hotel. If you like old stuff then this is for you . Take your time and browseThis street starts close to Itaewon's main street so it's easy to find and is a quaint lovely area to browse through. Most of the antiques are of western origin but it makes complete sense when you take into account the country's past - foreign soldiers were stationed there.If you're into antique really old stuff this place is for you not far from the station at Exit 2 or 3 and you'll be there it's full of really cool antique stuff like Furniture jewelry pretty much anything ancient and antique definitely check it out it may be expensive but worth taking pictures of.This area is the antique hub of seoul. It sells all sorts of antiques from clothes to vintage records and bags. If only I could buy some to take home. Some of the pieces are quite heavy since they are furniture.Located couple streets behind the main one. Some cool and old stuff to buy but like almost anything in Itaewon, it is overpriced.Avoid. Unless into regular streets with a lot of old stuff on display for selling. Also, there were only 2 houses doing that. I might have been there at the wrong time though (6 pm).A bustling and busy street with many international and middle eastern restaurants. I highly recommend visiting this street"
한국 전쟁 기념관,"4,216건의<U+00A0>리뷰",서울 용산구 이태원로 29 (우) 04353,3위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"lots of people, but not crowdy , lot of exibition to see, lots of history, but all in very good condition, very clean.it will take you about 2 hours for your visit.The War Memorial of Korea ..... an educational history lesson. Have not visit museums for sometime, this stood out to be interesting and informative ! It is a beautiful place and definitely worth at least a couple of hours of your time in Seoul....As you walk towards the entrance, seeing the names of every soldier who died in the Korean War was a somber reminder of the price for freedom. The museum itself was well laid out and clean. Full of history and a good memorial.Would recommend.I try to avoid war type memorials, but this one turned out to be probably the best museum in Seoul. Really good, mostly unbiased review of the wars on the Korean Peninsula. Enough english to keep it interesting. The art pieces were particularly well though out and you can't beat the price (free!). I'd argue this is a must visit while in Korea.I spent a rainy afternoon here by myself. I didn't spend too much time on the prehistoric history sections. Most of my time was spent on the second and third floors. It was very informative. I loved the interactive exhibits. I will definitely be back again.Visit if you are even a bit interested in learning about Korean history and specially about the 1950-53 Korean War. It's a beautiful monument and surely worth a couple of hours of your time. I was surprised to learn that an Indian medical contingent was in Korea during the war and that the Indian flag flies along with the Korean flag and the flags of all the countries that played a role in the war.An excellent place to visit. Well prepared information for tourists. The volunteers give you a very good guide in different languages. Lots to see and you can spend a whole afternoon there. A place likely missed by many tourists but is very worthwhile experience. Take the metro and walk for about 10 minutes.Great place to learn about the Japan-Korea war, I had very little knowledge before going. By the time I left, I learned a whole lot. Definitely visit if you have the time and you are in Itaewon area.We visited as part of a Seoul city tour and wish we could have returned to spend more time here. Emjoyed the bronze statues outside as part of the plaza. Wonderful displays inside. The memorial hall caused me to reflect deeply on the toll of human life that was lost. We sat in on an interactive presentation in a theater where the seats moved and we were right in the nose cone of a bomber plane, right on the landing beach, right in the middle of an air fight... Oh, my, so realistic and well done. Don't miss this!The memorial is easy to get to by train, and it is very quiet and not crowded with tourists. There are many things to read and objects of history to see in their museum. If you like to visit museums and read about their historical timeline, and visit quiet places, this place is good. We did not get to finish walking the whole place as it was closing soon."
삼성미술관 리움,730건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 용산구 이태원로55길 60-16 (우) 04348,24위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"American visiting Seoul for second time and wanted to experience antiquities and somewhat close to Seoul center. It’s a very professional and beautiful museum. Keep walking up the hill on the right, there is a sign that maybe misleading to have you turn left, but stay on right side of road, past parking garage, and open entrance with walkway of circles embedded in walkway that keep lighting up green numbers. After paying admission and picking up your ear piece audio guide, take elevator to 4th floor and work your way down through celadon, pottery, textiles, Buddhas, crowns and other artifacts. Some modern pieces here too and the spiral staircase with a beautiful work of glass art down the middle. There’s a gift shop, cafe and restrooms. Lovely museum! Very glad we went.One day and a half in this wonderful city, so I choose quality over quantity and beeline for the Leeum Samsung Museum. Here I settle in for two hours taking in exceptional examples of Korean porceline, calligraphy and metalworks which then set the stage for a leap into modern and contemporary visual art displays featuring icons including De Kooning, Brown, Giacometti and Rothko, while avoiding the crowds one finds at the National Museum of History and the National Museum of Contemporary Art. The rest of the day can be spent in a myriad of other sites in Seoul. I leave this museum saturated, satisfied and hopeful for another visit, another time and hopefully soon.The museum is most impressive architecturally. It is divided into three sections (each called a “museum”, and each section comprised of two or three floors). I personally was absolutely fascinated by the ceramics collection on the top floor of museum number 1. Much less enjoyed the exhibits in the other two museums. My companion on the other hand, highly enjoyed all three museums.Leeum is a beautiful modern building on its own. When you add the art collection, it is truly a worthwhile visit. Interesting juxtaposition of Korean artists against famous modern Western artists catalogs the evolution of modern art influence.try to book an English tour on Friday - beautiful location and superior collection. Small museum, you can go though all the exhibits in 2 hours. Skip the museum cafe- go down the hill to Passion 5 for dessert.This museum was in my guide book and since it was about 3 mins away from our hotel, we decided to visit.I did not pay for the audio set but at only an extra 1,000 won it is worth getting. The museum is split into 3 parts with one part being dedicated to artifacts from various dynasties. The second museum is modern art and the third part is what I will define as ultra modern art. I liked this museum and it housed a couple of Damien Hirst paintings and a Francis Bacon painting together with 3 or 4 Anish Kapoor pieces or art.There were also a couple of unique art installations one which you enter and its mirrored everywhere. Definitely worth a visit.This is a manageable museum (you can cover a lot of ground in two hours here) that blends Korean history with modern art and works in between. Great exhibits and a fantastic campus with killer architecture to supercharge your Instagram. Also, around the museum is a v. cool area with trendy cafes and places to eat but not crazy expensive.We spent hours here and were glad we had the audio guide to help us along.We started on the top floor with the celadon and learned about its history while viewing national treasures.Later we thoroughly enjoyed the modern art collection . all in all a wonderful day!Simple and attractive . Useful audio guide. Handy in manual mode.Good idea to ban photo: one can focus on the works.Ceramics section interesting but not for everyone.Allow for 2-3 hours to cover this cute museum. It's not too big, therefore not too tiring or overwhelming. It has three parts. The first, with traditional Korean artifacts: ceramics, caligraphy, etc. The second includes ""serious"" modern art, and the third (and the most fun) exhibits contemporary, young, sophisticated and clever art.We loved it. It's a museum that has something for everyone."
CGV 용산,41건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 용산구 한강로 3가 40-999 아이파크몰 6층,17위(285곳의 서울 소재 즐길 거리 / 게임 중),"First experience with the Gold class theater(complex has a variety of ""classes"" of seating/theater). Gold class has a comfortable chair (like a recliner) and a table for food drinks that you may order. Very comfortable. It is also smaller than the general seating theater, so its a cozy theater. This comes with an elevated price tag, about 35,000 WAlso, sound system was greatThey had 20+ auditoriums for movie theater, and this place not just a movie theater. So many things you can found in here such as game center with VR zone, karaoke box, or snack/coffee counter.
It's like lot of fun packed into one place.Not a bad place, very clean, and very good service. I will say that anyone who is from the US army base gets a lot of nice perks such as a huge discount off from movie snacks, but when you get there not only will you find information on Korean movies with English subs, but also the chance to experience 4D movies! I mean, when you experience one 4D movie you pretty much experience them all and its a lot of fun for the first 20 or 30 minutes, but after awhile...... well, depends on how you like to have your seat moved around like a simulated ride or air blown/water squirted at your face for 2 hours or so? Yea.....Overall, its a good movie theater, and its a franchise too! Yet the place has a lot of restaurants to eat, most of them are also franchises as well(i.e. TGIF, California Pizza Kitchen, Burger King, etc).If you want to see a movie in 4D, IMAX, or just a regular movie this is the place to see it! Wonderful staff with a large popcorn menu if you just want to snack. There is a complete mall connected with various restaurants and cafes to choose from!I recently went to watch the new Hunger Games movie for an evening show. We prebooked tickets online. The theater is very easy to get to, since it is at I-Park Mall, attached to Yongsan Station. It didn't take long to grab our tickets from the cashier and a snack before heading up the escalator to the theater. The seats were comfortable, but my only complaint was not being able to actually pick out my seats when booking online. You can state your preference, however, and even let them know if you'd like your order cancelled if the seats you want aren't available. Other than that, good theater, clean, comfy, and PLENTY of showings/movie options.I watched an early morning movie at the Yongsan (I-Park) CGV. The start time for the movie was 0700. I arrived at the mall at 0600 and had no trouble finding a place to park. However, I did have trouble navigating to the movie theater. I parked on the opposite side of the mall from the theater. I attempted to walk through the mall to get to the theater. I saw several signs for the CGV, but the doors were locked as were most of the stores and main thoroughfares in the mall at this early hour. I exited the mall and walked on the outside of the mall to the side of the mall that the theater is located on. All the doors on that side were locked as well. I saw a gentleman with a mall name-tag on and asked him for directions. He took me to a door in the center of the mall, I had to go up a flight of stairs one floor then get on an elevator and finally made it to the 6th floor. Ticketing is on the 5th floor but the elevator button for that floor did not work. After getting off on the 6th floor I made my way down one floor to the ticketing office, secured my tickets and enjoyed the I-MAX movie. The theater was clean and the chairs were comfortable. Overall it was a nice experience. If you go in the early morning hours, allot extra time for locked doors."
진관사,13건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 은평구 진관길 73 북한산 (우) 03308,239위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"I wanted to visit a temple before the sunset, and Jingwansa was my first choice since it is located inside Seoul and in one of its most famous neighborhood, although it was hard to find, I spent around an hour walking around the area before finding it, but it was worth it! It was worth every minute I spent looking for it!There was kind of festival back then and I understood nothing about it, all papers and prayers were written in Korean, but the area was FULL with flowers and it was one of the most enchanting places I ever visited, with these believers and monks and tourists.I was lucky to see this temple in morning and to witness the sunset there, both scenes were remarkable.Absolutely will visit it again.Absolutely beautiful. It was neat to see all the colorful lanterns. The temple had three large golden Buddha's. great place for cultural emersion.Apparently only female monks are permitted to reside here.The grounds are expansive and surrounded by gorgeous Korean pine trees. All areas are immaculately tidy and clean. Views of Bukhan mountain abound. There is also a temple stay (not tested), and a small tea shop under a thatched roof. All very quaint and pleasant. Technically within the city limits of Seoul and only 30-45 minutes by ground transport from the centre, it's a lovely half day out. Highly recommended.It is the first time I have experienced the temple stay, and definitely, I really enjoyed every moment in Jingwansa.The senior Nun taught us many lessons which brought peace and calm in my mind. Despite the complicated life outside, all lessons cooled down my burning head.Even I had to sleep at 9:30PM and wake up at 4PM, but I felt so fresh. Then, I felt the peace in mind after 108 prostrations.The food is very very delicious, which is much more different from I expected.I went to this Buddist temple not knowing what to expect. Beautifully set in an amazing natural spot it helps one find peace immediately. The different temples with the monks chanting is mesmerizing. It's a bit difficult to know the expectations of how to behave but it turned out fine. Nice cafe with the most friendly people ever. Loved it and want to come back for temple stay.I went to this temple for a templestay, the only thing is that I wish we would have had time to walk around and explore the beautiful nature that is all around. It looked like such a wonderful place to climb the mountain from. So peaceful. Si beautiful. And so painfully far from centertown... It took me a couple of subways and a bus to get there. It was tiring."
북악산 서울 성곽,80건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 종로구,98위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"This is about 90~120 min wall walking on Bugaksan Mountain. It's really good walking(or easy hiking) on the mountain. But, with some restrictions, I think Inwangsan Seoul Fortress gives a better satisfaction.- This is the part of Seoul Fortress securing Hanyang(former name of Seoul in Joseon Dynasty). Severely damaged and rebuilt actually.- West End: Changuimun Gate / East End: Sukjeongmun Gate- Since starting/ending points are uneasy to reach by public transportations, there aren't many visitors. I recommend starting from Changuimun Gate (bus #1020 #7022 #7212) and ending to Sukjeongmun Gate. And it's about 15~20 min walk to the bus stop (bus #1111 #2112).- Wall walking is not that exhausting nor risky. But, it has some secured sites nearby. Visitors must present ID cards at the entrances. Visiting time is limited. Taking photos/videos toward them is not permitted. Cameras are watching and they'll come to you soon if you don't follow. On the other hands, Inwangsan Seoul Fortress has almost no restriction. So, I recommend Inwangwan for more comfortable time.- Good viewpoints: Baegakmaru(peak), Cheongwoondae and Gokseong- This is obviously the main course of Bugaksan Mountain. But, Bugaksan also has other nice areas such as Bugak Palgakjeong Pavilion, Bugak Skyway, Kim Shin-Jo Route(hiking route of terrorists' invasion), etc.Firstly, come here only if you want exercise and views and nothing else.We came for the historical part of it and was disappointed. The bullet ridden tree was such a let-down. They had removed all the bullets, applied cement over it to close up the hole, then painted a very fake looking red and white bulls eye over the supposed bullet holes.Didn't see no soldiers guarding the place.And yes - the stairs are really quite grueling!We carted up 1.5L of water per person based on other reviews. We drank at most 1L each. And we went on a hot summer day at noon. Most of it is quite shady thanks to the treesWould I recommend this to anyone? NO! Unless you enjoy hiking 2 hours to look at fake bullet holes. View was quite nice tho but you get the same thing at Namsan Hill with a fraction of the effortWe had a good trek up the fortress walls and were rewarded with a great view of the surrounding town and good exercise.

Recommended to come here in the morning to avoid potential crowds and also to work up an appetite for lunch laterI probably should have done my homework a bit better and read other reviews that recommended climbing Seoul City Wall beginning at the western part of the wall at the Malbawi Information Center. Instead I started my ascent at the Changuimun Gate. As others have said, this is a restricted military area and one must show a resident card or passport and sign in. You will be given a badge to wear for the duration of your climb, and boy what a climb it was. I cannot say I am in the best shape so this was very strenuous and hard on the knees. At points I thought it was never going to end but the views were worth it and I met many nice people along the route. It also was not very crowded. I started my journey around 1330 and ended up at Samcheong Park around 1600. Make sure you bring plenty of water. There are no restrooms or facilities along the way. Pictures of the city are restricted in many areas, with the 121 bullet tree a stark reminder of why this is a military zone. I will say the tree was further away from the Blue House than I thought it would be. I took a picture of it as I doubt I will be adventurous enough to try this walk again...even if I began from the other direction!!! I probably should have exited from Waryong Park but was told it would be easier to catch a cab by Samcheong Park--that was a good 1/2 trek from the Malbawi Info Center, but luckily it was largely downhill. In the end I found a bus as I exited the park that dropped me off in front of the Sajong Performing Arts Center and picked up the metro from there. Altogether I am glad I did this but boy were my legs aching the next day.My son and I did a day trip to visit all the remaining gates of seoul fortress. We started at the Malbawi Information Center and hiked to the Changuimun Information Center. This course was easier than hiking from the Changuimun Gate.Depending on your level of fitness, the hike may take between 2 - 2 1/2 hours. The steps should not be underrated as they are very steep in some areas. There are no toilet or garbage facilities after reaching the Malbawi Center, so ensure that you have sufficient water and carry your garbage with you until the end of the hike.Malbawi Information Center may be reached by taking subway line 3 to Anguk Station, then bus # 2 to Sungkyunkwan University Rear gate. There is no visible bus stop at the university, but it will be clear that you are at the last stop. It is the stop after the entrance to Waryog Park, and is a steep climb uphill. I think that it was the 8th bus stop from Anguk. Continue to walk uphill for 5 minutes and the Seoul Fortress wall will be seen. Walk along the path next to the wall for 600 meters, always keeping the wall in view on your left, and you will reach Malbawi information Center. It should be noted that there are few signs in English , and at one point a small foot bridge is passed and a really steep staircase that when climbed takes you over the wall. When on the other side of the wall, the malbawi Information center is a 5 minute walk away.Passports have to be provided for inspection and a form filled out, after which an ID tag will be received. This tag is placed around your neck and will have to be returned to Changuimun/Malbawi Information Center after your hike is completed. Guards are posted at regular intervals along the trail, and photos may only be taken at the following areas: Sukjeongmun gate, Baegakmaru, Chatdaebawi Rock, 1.21 Pine Tree, Baegak Rest area and Dolrae Rest Area. If in doubt, ask the guard if you can take a photo.The hike offers beautiful views of Seoul, and the North and Northwest gates of Seoul Fortress. At the Changuimun Gate there is a bronze statue and memorial stone for soldiers who died during the 1.21 incident. Buses to Gwanghwamun Square can be easily taken by crossing the road at Changuimun gate.My wife, 5 year old son and I did this hike from Hyehwamun Gate to Changuimun Gate over a duration of about 4 hours. My son is very active, a strong hiker, and had no problem with the physical challenge. My wife and I are fit but nevertheless our legs were quite sore by the end of the hike. From the direction we came (East to West) there is a very steep 300m decsent at the end of the hike which was difficult on the knees. The views of Seoul are fantastic. The view looking down on the royal palace is interesting. This hike was not available to civilians until it was opened in 2012. This is a military zone due to the proximity to the Korean presidential residence and photos are restricted. Bring your passport (visitors) or alien registration card (residents) if you are not a Korean citizen.In the area of hyehwa, it's supposedly known for buskers and street performers. While finding a park, my friend and i chanced upon this uphill battle and realized it was a hill. It's not high, but has a great view of Seoul city. The remnants of the fortress allows you to take nice pictures too. However, sunset does not look too good on the hill..If you want, you can walk towards Sindang. You'll come across the mural village that was featured in Running Man (the one where they kicked their shoes up the stairs).It is a far walk though.Here's an idea for a morning commune with nature with some sightseeing of the ancient city wall and vistas to boot. Take a taxi to the entrance of Samcheong Park off of Bukchon-ro. Walk about half an hour uphill following the signs to Malbawi Lookout. At the information desk you will be asked to complete a little form and show your passport and you will be given a visitor tag attached to a lanyard to wear. Pick up an English language map if you wish. Now get ready for an hour of good fun with stairclimbing (at the fastest pace with only one quick camera stop) going up to reach Mt. Bukason and then down to Changuimun Gate where you will return the tag, walk down a flight of stairs and take a taxi home. Of course, this is not only one way to do the hike of the northern wall and you can feel free to hike part or the full way and return to your starting point. The strategic importance of the commanding heights cause the ROK army to be on trail maintenance duty so the developed trail is about as pristine as I have ever seen. The July Pine Tree with bullet holes (North Korean assassin squad had it taken to them in spades!) is curious. DO NOT FORGET YOUR PASSPORT AND WATER BOTTLE!I took the Waryong Park to Changuimun course, and the amount of stairs are no joke. I consider myself fairly fit but I was huffing away at some sections of stairs. The course was not very clearly marked and I had to ask the guards stationed all around to make sure I was going the right way. The scenery made up for it, you could see right across Bugaksan Mountain on a clear day. Remember to bring your passport as registration is a must, and bring plenty of water and some snacks or energy bar. I will hike this trail again when I go to Seoul next time.If you have a little more time on your hands, you can also start from Hyehwa subway station. The walk from the subway station to Sungkyunkwan University is through a nice shopping/cafe area, where you can grab some coffee, lunch or fruit juice. The university has a small entrance in the wall from the street that runs along its west side (Sungkyunkwan-ro 5-gil), head for the old buildings and check out the lecture hall and the ages old gingko tree. Then take the back gate to Waryong park (look up this location on your smartphone). From there, everything is well signed: follow the signs to Malbawi to get to the start of the military area. From there, you can only go one way: the westward one, which is, as others pointed out, the right way to do this hike, as it ends with the endless staircase downwards.On the other hand, the Hyehwa quarter is also a great place to end your day in one of its many bars and restaurants!"

낙산공원,261건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 종로구 동숭동 산2-10,34위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"For a young country like South Korea, this park has changed a lot. The best way to learn about the history and changes in the park and the wall surrounding the park book a free walking tour. This one is called ""Seoul fortress"" and takes about 2 hours. You will learn about Korean history, the 4 main gates, visit the wall museum and walk up to the top of the park to get a good view of Seoul. It takes 2 to 3 hours because you have to get to the Dongdaemun Station to meet the guide.From Hyehwa Station, I first visited the nearby Marronnier Park before arriving at Naksan park and then continue my way to Ihwa mural village. Reaching the park requires a moderate hike uphill for about 450 meters. It was hot & sunny as I was there around noon. There were only a few locals using the park.The park features multiple facilities an exhibition hall, a pavilion, a center for seniors, basketball courts, badminton courts, and many squares that offer wonderful views of the area below. A portion of the old fortress wall runs through the park. From Naksan Park, visitors can walk along the Seoul City Wall to Dongdaemun.It's a nice park with great views on the city. It's very steep. It's next to Ihwa Maeul so it is easy to combine the two.Close to mural village and good leisurely place to hike. The view at the top is amazing and can see Seoul N tower from far away. The sakura there was unbelievable and relatively less crowded, so you can actually have a picnic and enjoy the view from the top. Can also hike from Naksan park down along the way to DongDaeMun in around an hour if taking your time to take in everything. Would definitely recommend, even those with children.beautiful view in the cherry blossom season, fresh air for comfortable walk up the hill .Another suggested season to visit would be October to November. A refresh spot located in the city Centre. One of the four mountains in Seoul city.Although not many, I think the cherry blossom here completes the park and makes it a beautiful place to walk and spend time with love ones.Do visit the mural village which is just a 10 mins walk away, worth the visit :)Most of foreign tourist is really familiar with Namsan Park with its cable car and beautiful Seoul's view from the mountain. But, for domestic, there is one similar spot near Dongdaemun, it called Naksan Park. There is China's Great Wall miniatur and you can stroll along this wall to get the peak. The other way, after arriving at dongmyo station exit 10, you can take local green bus no.3 to Naksan Park directly, more efficient for family trip... :)Naksan Park - In Korean ‘nakta’ means camel and ‘san’ means mountain and therefore its camel hump-like appearance. Reaching the park requires a moderate hike uphill from Hyehwa Station in Daehangno for about 450 meters. Located in the center of the Seoul, this historical and beautiful park has panoramic views of the entire city. A portion of the old Seoul Fortress Wall runs (Seoul Seonggwak) built during the Joseon Dynasty for protection against invaders and enemies runs through the park. The serene ambience is a perfect gateway from the city bustle. Its scenic beauty makes it a popular filming location for many Hallyu dramas. Take in the sunset views or stay till evening for twinkling lights of Seoul at Naksan Park. If you head to the eastern side (as you look at the mountain) follow the wall downwards to reach the top of Ihwa Mural Village. Alternatively, hike the downhill stretch to Dongdaemun Gate. If you're deadbeat after the walk, just take bus no. 3 at the top of the park to get off at Dongdaemun station. Directions: Take Subway Line 4 to Hyehwa (Exit 2). Walk 70 meters and make the first left where there is the sculpture for Marronnier Park. Continue on Daehak-ro 8ga-gil for 180 meters until it dead ends and make a right. Continue for 50 meters and make at the second left on to Guldari-gil. Continue uphill for 200 meters to reach the park on the left.Famous place from all the K-Drama. We visited it while walking in the Ihwa Mural Village. We didn't pick the Naksan Park path, instead we climb the Ihwa Mural Village until we find the famous wall where all the K-Drama happening. It's nice and we'll probably hike the Naksan Park if it's not rainingWe were there mid September and the temperature was around 25°C but the wind was cooling. We started our walk from the Seoul City Wall Museum, which is minutes walk from Dongdaemun Station, Exit 9. From there, we walked along a section of the remaining city walls. There are steps along the walls, though some parts have uneven steps. After about 20 minutes into the walk, we reached Ihwa Mural Village where we 'pit stop' to walk around the village to enjoy the numerous murals and arts scattered in the village.From there we continued our walk towards Naksan Park. It was a pleasant walk and from the crowd mix, it can be seen that this park is one of the favourites among locals to enjoy the sunset. We reached the peak just in time for sunset and stayed until the sun has set, when the lights on buildings began to light up this beautiful city.We descended the hill by walking along the city walls and reached our starting point, near Dongdaemun Station, Exit 9.Overall, it was a nice and pleasant walk. Would recommend visiting the park for the sunset at the peak."
광화문,980건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 종로구 사직로 161 (우) 03045,45위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"Well, since it is considered an attraction all by itself and it is right next to Gyeongdukgung Palace, there really isn't any reason to miss Gwanghwamun Gate.Visit when the guards are changing, grab some pictures and move on.This is an impressive and large gate into the palace and best seen during the changing of the guard every hour between 10 AM and 3 PM each day.It was built in 1395 but destroyed during a Japanese invasion in 1592, and rebuilt in 1867. A popular place for tourists.One of the many traditional and historical gates of the city that welcomes you to the past while standing in the middle of the modern technology of the presentThis traditional Korean palace gate, with a distant-mountain backdrop, remained our objective as we ambled North on Gwanghwamun Square. We had come to see Gyeongbokgung Palace, the most important during the Joseon Dynasty, and this main and largest gate to the complex was how we planned to enter. Though the original structure went up in 1395, the gate has endured poor condition, destruction and movement to nearby locations throughout the centuries. The most recent restoration, completed in 2010, is authentic in capturing the original’s look, materials and placement The two-story granite-and-wood pavilion displays a stark-white base, which matches the palace’s outer wall, and a double green-tiled roof. Three archways in the gate reflect how the palace was once entered. The king passed through the central opening, while the crown prince and royal officers used the other two. This beautiful gate, displaying a much earlier-era architecture. seemed strangely juxtapositioned in modern Seoul with nearby tall buildings and much vehicular traffic passing by. A massive courtyard sprawls behind the gate, where visitors can enter for free. An admission charge is assessed, however, to proceed beyond this area. We arrived too late to see the colorful changing of the guard ceremony, which occurs here at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., but had already witnessed this spectacle elsewhere in the city. Dozens of the myriad visitors standing around wore traditional Korean garments. These can be rented in the courtyard area.For those without time to explore the huge royal palace complex, I recommend a quick stop here to see the gate and timed for the changing of the guards, which does not take place on Tuesdays. There are nearby Metro stops.The gates of the palace, good for photos and specially if you can catch the guards ceremony and changing hours. Check the schedule before coming.The Gwanghwamun Gate is on of the most popular gates in Seoul. All of the gates have an own and unique story which you can figure out.It's just a gate as part of the larger Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's an impressive structure to behold.This is the main gate into the grand palace. While most of these gates look similar, this main gate is impressive. It prepares you to expect the greatness inside.Gwanghwamun is the main gate for the royal palace. Changing of the guard occurs here. A fine piece of Korean architecture.I was very impressed by this massive, ceremonial entrance to Gyeongbokgung Palace. When I first arrived I thought there was a row of mannequins dressed as imperial guards, but they are real! They stands so still, honestly it's quite remarkable. The gate is beautiful when seen from both sides. It is possible to see it for free as the ticket booth is well inside the gate.The changing of the guard ceremony is quite something else but even if you are not there for that, it's a magnificent gate and well worth a lingering stop on my opinion"

광화문 광장,721건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 종로구 세종대로 172 (우) 03154,65위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"Just down from the two large palaces you will find this quite interesting square in the center of the road containing a statue of King Joseon (sitting) and Admiral Yi Sun Shin on a Pedestal.The square also has some interesting potted trees.The Admiral was famous for his battles with the Japanese during their invasion in the 16th Century, at the time Josoen was on the throne.Just 10 years ago, this public square replaced 10 traffic lanes as part of various environmentally friendly renovations going on in Seoul. The big rectangle runs from Gwanghwamun Gate on the North to Sejongno Sageon intersection on the South. We walked its length from the intersection, en route to Gyeongbokgung, the city’s premier palace on a Saturday afternoon. I saw no greenery anywhere on the square to soften the effect of its vast concrete underfoot, but many attention-grabbers beckoned, including two big statues.We encountered the first statue almost immediately, at the Southern edge of the square. It depicts a standing Admiral Yi Sunshin (1545-1598), who led the defeat of the Japanese Navy in the Imijin War. A nearby fountain, known as the 12.23, commemorates the admiral’s 23 battles with 12 warships during that war. The second statue, also nicely crafted, appears in the middle of the square, showing King Sejong (1397-1450) seated on a throne. Among other accomplishments, he created the Korean alphabet.While looking around the king’s statue, we discovered an entrance at the rear that led to a lower level with two free exhibition halls focused on the king and the admiral. History buffs, we spent about 1 hour here, learning fascinating information about both men. Returning to sunlight again, we came across a book fair on the square, where many events are held for the public.Three traffic lanes flank both the East and West sides of the square and a Metro entrance is in the square itself. Government administrative offices appear beyond the lanes on the East Side and the Sejong Center (performing arts), which we also visited, is the standout building on the West side.The square is large with 2 huge statues of Korea's historical figures. And in the background you can see the mountain and the palace.A busy main road with a central area surrounded by a few civic buildings sums up the square. Not much to see except a couple of statues and lots of traffic. Leads up to Gyeongbokgung Palace and gate.Not much to do here other than see the statues. I presume they have events here throughout the year. Seems to be popular with tourists. In a great area as there are lots of coffee shops and restaurants nearby. Good to visit after the palace as it’s just outside.There is a fringe political group holding protests in the area - every weekend apparently - they wear earplugs and shout through very loud speakers, block the way and harangue tourists. I would advise staying away until these folks shuffle off.This is the massive and impressive public square in front of the main entrance to Gwanghwamun Palace and its full of interesting statuary and plenty of plaques explain things that used to be there and things that still do! Great views of the palace and its main gate. Loads of life and bustle about and its very close to the main shoppibg areas and lots of eateries.Great historical figure, lots to learn about the Korean alphabet and their way of thinking based on this historical figureThis square is just in front of Gwanghwamun Gate, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace. The square has 2 imposing statues, ie King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sun-Sin. To know more about the 2 figures, suggest you visit the underground museum, located just behind the statue of the king. Free admission. Nice to spend about 10 to 20 mins enjoying the air con and use the toilet before moving on.This is a very formal and grand public square in honour of the well loved Emperor Sejong.There is a museum in the basement (free admissions) which is below the statute of the Emperor. Look for the interesting displays on the history of Korea, Hangeul language and the lifestyle of the early days.You could watch a short movie, which is very informative, in this small museum.Back to the Gwanghwamun Square, there are many spots for nice photos."
세종대왕 동상,460건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 종로구 세종로,68위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"This is one of two impressive statues in Gwanghaman Square, the other being that of Admiral Yi Sun-Sin. Sejong lived from 1307 until 1450 and was the fourth King in the Jaseon Dynasty.The title of Great"" apparently bestowed on all kings after they died but Sejong did invent the Korean alphabet , known as Hangul and promoted science and other good things.And a nice, big and impressive statue it was and fitting for a historic ruler.One of the statues in the square where you can watch the palace and the mountain view behind it. Good for some photos.The Stature of Sejong the Great is usually very busy around Daytime. So make sure you have time. Go in the morning or evening to make some good pictures with the montains behind the stature. Also there are a lot of other great tourists spots around the stature which you may should check out.This imposing statue is the focal point in Gwanghwamun Square. It is to honour King Sejong the Great, the fourth and most respected king of the Joseon Dynasty and creator of Hangeul, Korea's alphabet. A passageway behind the statue leads to a museum, featuring the life and achievements of this king. Free admission.Loved the location on the large square with the mountains in the background. We were delighted to find a door behind the statue which led to a museum about Sejong the Great where we learnt he invented the Korean alphabet!I was here, and I was amazed at the creation of the statue and the history behind it. Come here if you want to enjoy history :).Ever since I've watched a drama about King Sejong, I knew I had to visit his statue and take a photo with him. Little did I know that it's in the center of Seoul. It is very easy to find and impossible to miss when visiting the Gyeongbokgung Palace, Cheonggyecheon Stream, and other famous spots in Seoul.King Sejong's statue is among the popular tourist spots in the area so don't miss taking a souvenir photo with him. You might just have to fall in line. And maybe ask for someone to take your photo if traveling alone like me.so majestically built to one of the best king during joseon dynasty. if I am a Korean, I feel really and totally proud.The statue of King Sejong one of the greatest rulers of Joseon Dynasty has been installed in the G Square as a gratitude for his contribution in strengthening the Joseon Dynasty and also as an inventor of Korean Alphabets <U+2013> the Hangeul, Armillary globe, rain gauge, the Sun dial etc. He is remembered for his contribution to the great strides Korea made in the field of agriculture, science, technology.The bronze statute which is about 9.5 meters high shows the King sitting with a book in his hand and a gentle smile. There are around 6 columns behind the statue showcasing the accomplishments of this great king.There is also an exhibition underground depicting the achievements of the king which is open to public.Include the visit to this place along with the visit G Palace.Located at Gwanghwamun. Good place to visit before/after Gyeongbokgung! The exhibitions were all in Korean though."

Yi Sun-Sin improved on the Turtle Ships that had eleven cannons on each side, two each in the bow and stern and spikes on the roof to avoid being boarded.Some historians have put him alongside Horatio Nelson as a a ship-lover leader but that may be pushing it. Better than Horatio!.Nice Statue but not as nice as the column in London.One of the two statues in this square. The square and statues can be found right infront of the palace. Good for some quick photos.This statue is to honour a famous and respected admiral best known for his military achievements during the Imjin War. There is also a small underground museum in memory of the Admiral. In front of the statue there is a water fountain called 23.12 representing the 23 wars the Admiral won with 12 warships.I saw this when I was walking around Seoul. Very enjoyed reading about the history of Admiral Yi Sun-Sin. Go here if you want to learn about him, and why he is important.Considered as a War hero, the 6.5 meters bronze statue of Admiral Yi Sun-sin is situated in the G Square which is in front of the G-Palace. The statue shows the Admiral in a standing posture, holding a sword in his right hand the face depicting the determination of a soldier.Near the statue there is a miniature turtle ship representing the war vessel which the Admiral supposed to have commanded during the war. There is also a small museum in the memory of the Admiral.Also in front of the statue there is a water fountain called 23.12 representing the 23 wars the Admiral won with 12 warships.I had never heard of this famous 16th-century Korean admiral until I visited Gwanghwamum Plaza, where his bronze statue anchors its southern end. But now I know that Admiral Yi Sun-Sin has a fascinating background, including incredible military achievements during the Imjin War (1592-96) when he defended Korea against Japanese invaders. Yi Sun-Sin invented the ironclad ""turtle"" ship. It was so successful that it took only a few to win a battle with hundreds of the enemy's traditional ships.Sculptor Kim Se-jung's 1968 work depicts the war hero standing in armor, with a massive sword in the right hand. A miniature replica of the turtle ship appears just below the statue. The bronze and its high pedestal rise about 56 feet above the plaza. The 12:23 fountain nearby received its name from the 23 battles the admiral fought with 12 ships. It was not operating during my day visit in October, but I saw it in action with colored lights, passing by in a bus one night.As a history buff, I enjoyed the small museum under the plaza devoted to Admiral Yi Sun-Sin and King Sejong.This is an impressive statue located in the centre of the city and the great thing about it is that there is a museum underground here where you can also learn so much about Korean history. The statue is very close to the statue of Sejong the Great and also walking distance to Gyeongbokgung Palace.Another great feature here is the water fountain in the evening time. The fountain is lit up and changes colour all the time and here you will always find kids playing in the fountain. My own young kids insisted to come here several times.I just liked the pose of Admiral Yi Sun- Sin as he appears as this bronze statue on Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul. As a hero from the sixteenth century, he is celebrated for his triumphs against the invading Japanese.It is a small statute which you'll automatically pass by when visiting the Gwanghwamun district. There's a year-long protest going on nearby the statute, so make sure you do not offend people there by taking photos like tourists. There's always somekind of protest going on around the statute, which will rarely be a probblem for you, but still, be cautious.It is recommended to start your Seoul trip here along with the statue of King Sejong the Great and then walk to the main palace. There is a nice and free museum under the two statues that tells you about these two great Korean men. The part about Admiral Yi Sun-Sin details great navel battles and shows how he saved Korea from the Japanese invasion overcoming great odds due to strategy and better ship designs. A true David and Goliath story."

These multiplexes each have 10+ theatres in one location and yet, most of them are full of blockbusters. Many art movies or Oscar contending movies, are usually not available in those places. Cinecube is one of a few independent theatres in Seoul where they screen those good in-the-monority type of movies. There are only two screens here, and obviously seats numbers are very small and limited, but that only makes the whole experience much better. If you are getting sick of what the multiplexes are throwing at you, and you're wanting to see those real good movies, not only in english but also in french, spanish and whatnot, check out this place. One of the good thing about this place is you can almost always get a ticket on sight without making a reservation beforehand. Enjoy!"

동대문 (흥인지문),452건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 종로구 종로 288 (우) 03119,95위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"Amazing building, really worth the visit and spending some time to soak it all in!Super easy to access via the subway system and conveniently located, this is a must visit!This is one of 8 gates. You could not enter when I was there, only a photo from outside.Its name means great east gate.You can access it from either subway 1 or 4.Walk past Dongdaeumun Design Centre, and keep walking straight - the Heunginjimun Gate will suddenly appear in view. It's an impressive structure - a two tiered building on a solid stone base in which there is a tunnel which housed the gate. This is the East Gate of Seoul, one of four main gates in the old Seoul City Wall. The Gate was first built by King Taejo during his fifth year of reign (1398). It was renovated in 1453, and the current structure is the one rebuilt in 1869.What is particularly impressive is the half circle outer wall enclosure (the Ongseong). This was a powerful defensive device because visitors who entered were surrounded. It also protects the gate against a battering ram.You can view it from all around, but there is no entry.To best view it, you need to cross the road up to the Heunginjimun Gate Park which is where the City Wall now starts, and view it on eye level.Information about the gate is sparse, even though the small information placard states it is Korea's National Treasure number 1. To find out more and to see the Jaspyan statues up close, visit the Seoul City Wall Museum which is about 100 metres up in the Heunginjimun Gate Park. It's free to visit, has scale models and a lot of fascinating information about the gate and the Seoul City Wall.See my photos.I came across this massive gate, one of the four major entrances to Seoul centuries ago, while walking to the nearby Dongdaemun Design Center. An imposing structure, this is the only city gate with a small wall that was constructed to give the Joseon Dynasty fortress additional protection against invaders. Though originally built in 1398, the gate has undergone many restorations, and it appeared to me that one must have occurred quite recently, based on its current excellent condition.Located in an extremely busy traffic area, this Eastern gate can be difficult to reach on foot. Though I managed to do so, the entrance was blocked off and the effort to get there hardly seemed worthwhile. I ended up ascending a small hill across the street by the Seoul City Wall. This provided a superb vantage point for the gate and the surrounding neighborhood. My visit occurred during the afternoon. Later, when I walked by at night, the gate had been beautifully illuminated and I had an even better appreciation of the structure. Dongdaemun Gate is about a 5-minute walk from the Dongdaemun Subway stop (Lines 1 and 4). Take Exit 1 or 6 - 10.One thing I hate about Seoul is how bloody difficult it can be to cross the street. You can't really get close to the gate because of how the gates are set up, so don't feel bad if none of your pics turn out right. After some shopping at the nearby namdaemun market, you can come here for some shots. There's several of these bad boys around Seoul, so go catch em all.Interesting gate, but not as accessible or explained as well as the Sungnyemun Gate. Good for some photos and as a point to start a longer walk to explore the Seoul City Wall, which commences just North of the Dongdaemun Gate and climbs up to Naksan Park.Also known as Heunginjimun Gate, it is the largest gate in Seoul. A unique feature is the half-circle shaped wall to protect the gate. In fact, it is the only gate among Seoul’s eight gates to have this wall. For a good photo shoot, suggest you cross the road and climb uphill for about 5 to 10 mins in Dongdaemun Seonggwak Park. I visited during the late afternoon. I suppose evening is a better time to appreciate the buildings with the lighting.Though reconstructed several times throughout its 700 year history it is a magnificent monument to the Joseon Dynasty. Though inspiring from street level, it is even more impressive from the lounge or roomss facing from the JW Marriott Dongdaemun Square.Looking at the pictures, I should have gone at night. But even during the day the gate looks very impressive.Heunginjimun, literally ""Gate of Rising Benevolence"" or Dongdaemun, is one of The Eight Gates of Seoul in the Fortress Wall of Seoul, a prominent landmark in central Seoul. The Korean name ""Dongdaemun"" means ""Great East Gate,"" and it was so named because it was the major eastern gate in the wall that surrounded Seoul during the Joseon Dynasty. The structure was first built by King Taejo during his fifth year of reign (1398). It was renovated in 1453, and the current structure is the one rebuilt in 1869."

People have got together here to get cheap foods & drinks since a long ago. Feel the amazing atmosphere of average people.- The location is near Jongno-3-ga Station Line #5(purple).- For foreign tourists, they have to embrace some hygiene problem. It's not clean enough mostly. A language, too. They are not foreigner friendly.- Instead, they are affordable and good for the price."
교보문고 광화문,151건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 종로구 종로1가 1,1위(502곳의 서울 소재 쇼핑 중),"Kyobo is a chain, so there are stores all over Seoul, but the Gwanghwamun location is my favorite. They sell books and CDs, which reminds me of what the States used to have in the Borders chains, along with even more stuff. There are cafes and restaurants inside, too. There are sections for foreign languages and, depending on your language, there are likely specialty shops elsewhere that will better serve you. The English section is small, but has great editions, like Oxfords World’s Classics, at cheap prices. The literary selection tends to be canonical, but the staff also has a large section devoted to best-sellers and newly published material, most of which is non-fiction, that is a sort of Korean-American cultural filter. There are always lots of families here and people milling about, reading, gathering books, enmeshed in the written word and the real world. Take some time here, slow down, observe, read something, think a few connected thoughts, have something to eat or drink...and enjoy. Over the past five or six years, there has been lots of renovation in the areas adjacent, particularly with high end restaurants and shops behind Kyobo and to the left. Jongno has remained the same and the Gwanghwamun Gwangjang is historical. Several years ago the Korean people protested then President Park Geun-Hye with candlelight vigils and songs on the square, every Saturday, for months. These protests began with small numbers that grew into the thousands, and arguably millions. These protests were part of the success in the removal of Park (December, 2016) and were amazing representations of the civil, non-violent assemblage of people for a cause. Democracies around the world would do well to follow in these Korean footsteps.This is a huge bookstore, connected to the Gwanghwamun metro station. A must visit for those who likes books, although mostly Korean books. There is also an English section. Do check out their interesting stationery items as well.Kyobo bookstore in Jongno-gu (near Gwanghwamun station) is a must-visit for anyone with a passion for books and simply spending time in bookstores. This particular branch (there are others dotted around the city) is, I believe, the largest. It has a vast collection of books in Korean, and sections for a number of other languages, with quite a good selection of books in English. The store also has a stationery section, puzzles and a cafe, and is surrounded by a number of other shops. Unlike so many bookstores these days, Kyobo allows you to spend time simply sitting on the provided comfortable benches, and reading. You'll find the store in the basement, accessible from the station.Without doubt the biggest book store I’ve ever seen, including Barnes & Nobel in the USA.Small English section, but were in Korea.Truly amazing to see how the experience is developed, the cafes, the associated offerings, eg Mont Blanc store. Retail at its bestThis is a big bookstore with many sections. We spent well over an hour in the stationery section alone. Super cute gift items. It's great to see so many people sitting in chairs or standing reading books. This place is a must visit for book lovers, even if you can't read Korean.Probably biggest book store what I've seen. Not only books but parfumes, DVD and CD, electronics, coffee shop etc. Basically you can spent whole day in this book store without get bored. Also goid selection of English language books available.There is a huge variety of books here, in fact same as similar shops everywhere in the world. Possible to find books in English, one good plus. For stationary materials, it is better and cheaper to enter smaller shops specific for stationary. You will lose much less time. Same is valid for other goods such as souvenirs, wallets, bags, toys, etc. If you want to buy only book and have specific list, enter and buy. Otherwise you can become crazy in crowd. As a summary, other than huge variety of books, nothing special.This Book Store is amazing! It's located at the Basement of the Kyobo Building. The person at the Information Counter was so helpful and efficient. She gave me a print out based on the info which I gave her (Book Titles & ISBN Numbers) in order for me to locate the books that I was looking for. As I was pressed for time, I went to the designated location but was too overwhelmed andI decided to ask their Book Concierge Counter for assistance. The lady was so helpful and found the books which I was looking for very quickly. If you love books, this is a must place to visit! I will definitely go again and spend at least a day in this Book Store!I stumbled on this while walking out of the Gwanghwamun subway station and was amazed at the range of books and local crowd on a Sunday morning. The English section is located on a corner closer to the cafe. It is one of the largest I have seen in Seoul as English books are not common. Especially for literature on Korean art and culture published by the national cultural institute. There is also a comprehensive list of titles published by Tuttle books on Korean national identity and history. There are also titles on the Korean War as well as current works on North Korea. The store also has a nice cafe and sections devoted to stationery and fine writing instruments. I wish there would be more such stores in Singapore as this reflects the knowledge seeking identity of a nation and I am happy that print is still king in some places.We were recommended to visit the bookstore and music store by the Tourist Information Center (I would recommend you to ask them for advice - superb service). We were looking for some KPop albums as well as some specific stationery. Kyoto bookstore (with HotTracks music store inside) are located at the basement and once you get there, you will be amazed. Through costs is relatively more expensive than Malaysia for the same items, there are just a wide variety of things not seen else where - books, Stationeries, music albums."

국립 고궁 박물관,194건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 종로구 효자로 12 (우) 03045,50위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"This museum is in the grounds of Gyeonbokgung palace and is a great place to get a bit more understanding about the Joseon dynasties - especially if you didn't have guided tour of the palace. Just the right size to be interesting but not bombard you with too much information.Entrance is free and there is audio guide that you can rent at the information desk. It is located within Gyeongbukgung but just outside the ticketing booth. Plenty of displays and descriptions depicting the lives of the royal families who lived in the palaces. Took us an hour to complete though we would love to stay longer.I arrived at the Gyeongbokgung Palace at 0930hr, too early to witness the changing of royal guards ceremony at 1000hr, Hence I decided to visit this nearby museum first. There are free digital locker to store my backpack. This museum displays royal relics from the Joseon Dynasty. There are many exhibition halls, with each hall displaying exhibits of Kings of the Joseon Dynasty, Joseon Palaces, Royal Court Life, Korean Empire, Astronomy & Science Hall Ⅰ, Royal Court Paintings, Jongmyo, the Royal Ancestral Shrine, Royal Court Music, Royal Procession, Astronomy & Science Hall Ⅱ. After visiting the museum, I have a better understanding of the King’s life during that era. Admission is free with toilet facilities and seats for resting.This museum covering several dynasties of Korea is well worth a visit, and well take you 2-3 hours. Beautiful displays of wonderful historical objects. There is a small restaurant on site to take time to relax.Entrance to the museum is free and audio guides of various languages can be obtained at the information desks at 1k KRW. The audio guide is user friendly which detects exhibits automatically so you dont have to key in anything. The museum is well kept and organised and gives good explanation to the Josean dynasty. Worth going if you are heading to Gyeongbukgung grounds.This was a free museum located off the main parade grounds of Gyeongbokgung Palace. We toured the Palace and grounds first, watched the changing of the guards ceremony before heading indoors to tour this museum. Inside there were three floors of history that covered practically all aspects of royal life, from birth until death, for the Joseon dynasty. The following stood out for us:-The display on royal processions was quite impressive as it explained the size and significance of the various groups of people who were required to escort the king during a formal outing. -The scientific accomplishments and capabilties including a water clock but unfortunately for us was going through maintenance during our visit. I thought the displays and their explanations was very well put together and held the interest of the whole family. Compared to the crowds attending the changing of the guards ceremony it felt like we had the museum to ourself.The museum is medium sized compared to most museums I've visited, but that means it is extensive enough to peak your interest but manageable enough to complete in one morning/afternoon session. The exhibits range all the way back to the 1300s until 1910 when the Korean royalty was overthrown by the Japanese.I felt walking through here that a lot was expected from crown prince from birth that from the age of 5 it was constant preparation to lead a country and to be a great king. Not that it was easier on crown princess.It makes you reflect on the weight of a kingdom.The palace museum shows a large collection and explanations of different king dynasties and different royal belongings during the last centuries.Museum currently has an exhibit of things from Lichtenstein. While cool, it takes up most of the museum which leaves not a lot of information on Korean palaces. Overall, museum does a good job explaining what you are seeing and setting you up for Gyeongbokgung which is next door."

Very close proximity to the train station (Exit 9 of Hongik Univ Station) so its very very easily accessible. A must go if you are a first timer in Korea!So kind of products you can find toys,bag,clothes with good price. But sales person do not know english. Therefore it is so hard to discuss. they are showing price with calculate machine it is realy problem.I went to this market and tried all kinds of street food available in Seoul..the soju was cheap and the food excellent.Could not finish so many choices so need to come back again in futureGreat variety of shops and stalls. There are all types clothes and goods for sale and plenty of food on offerLots of stores and street food options. Many western style malls but each mall offers essentially the same range of stores such as Adidas etc. Contrastingly local malls are full of toot and not particularly useful for foreigners.Stall after stall selling what is seemingly the same food. I found places that looked the freshest and tried a lot of different dishes. I have no idea what I ate, but it was all good!There are many restaurants and also shops selling clothings, shoes, bags. Nothing exciting. Not highly recommended. Visit only if you have time.This is not one market, but is a large commercial district comprising of shopping malls such as Doota, Migliore, apM Place and traditional markets such as wholesale clothing, shoes etc. The iconic landmark is the Heunginjimun Gate. It is best to visit in the evening when it is lively, though crowded. Suggest you climb uphill for 5 to 10 mins just behind the Heunginjimun Gate, to have a great view of the surrounding area.Many small shops and restaurants nearby. Mostly young crowd. Evening is better to walk around. Easy to get to by subway"

I was like, ok, but you give free drinks. But apparently you have to pay for them extra. Cats like to be fed by soft food 4-5$So for one he of petting cats I ve spent around 28$. Absolutely not worth it experience. Moreover there are better places with cheaper price. Looked like at least they brought drinks to Koreans, but not usWas there on August 8.2019 evening. Hope you guys will have different experienceCats are nice and lazy thoughI took my 9 year old son here one early evening in a Myeongdong and we had a blast. It only costs the price of a drink to enter, I think I paid around $20 for both of us but the drinks were very good. The cats are extremely spoiled, you can’t put them up but have to wait for them to either come to you or allow one of the staff to hand you one in a blanket. But it’s a fun experience and very sanitary. A cat lover’s can’t miss.This was our first visit to an animal cafe. We love cats. All of the cats were very mellow and sweet. I would definitely visit again.Wasn't expecting to have a cover chsrge but definitely a nice change of pace from the hustle and bustle of Seoul. Thirty cats interacting or sleeping contentedly. Very well cared for. Must hand ssnitize, remove footwear, put jackets/backpacks in plastic bag and not pick up a furry ( or not so furry in the case of the sphinx cat) feline. Enjoyed our refreshments while observing and petting cats!cats are amazing so chill out makeing you chill out great for old young couples and family would go againCats will be your companion while drinking a nice coffee or juice. Just be patient, they will somehow come to your place and play with you. It was nice to see that the cats are living in such good conditions and don't have to be on the streetsThe cafe is clean and not smelly, if you are afraid of cat, you can also come here because most of the cats are passive. they provide toys, and you can play with the cat and take a picture together.You have to be patient, but they are really friendly and like sleeping on you. Buying some treats make all the difference.Was waiting to check into our hotel and decided to pay this cat cafe a visit as my children love cats. We found the cat mascot and he led the way. Entrance fee was 10000won/adult, 8000won/child which includes a drink. The cat food costs 2000won per sachet. Oh boy, there were so so many cats and they were so chubby, fat and fluffy. They have signs to instruct guests not to feed cats with yellow collar as these cats were too obese or on special diet. The cats in blue collars were slightly unfriendly which you need to pay attention. Out of 3 to 4 staffs, only one was unfriendly, the rest were OK. They have cat toys for you to play with the cats too. You may stay as long as you wish in the cat cafe, there is no time limit. Overall the place is clean and pleasant as well.It was quite nice. The cats all seem happy there. They are fed and cared for and given lots of attention. They are not mistreated. They are house cats. Drinks were good, I didn’t have anything to eat but the drinks were like the standard Korean coffee shop fare.Would recommend."

While we took pictures other people were waiting we finish eating and stop taking pictures :<I just visited Stylenanda over the weekend and had so much fun! What is this place? It’s a makeup and fashion 6 floor store with hotel themed concept. This pink facade is so much more! It’s always an adventure being here, and it’s always hard for me to resist leaving without getting something. I surrendered yet again and got a bag and a lipstick, but I wanted so much more. I truly enjoyed myself here - kind of felt like a little kid at a candy store. The pink pool cafe on the rooftop is probably the highlight for most people. Check this place out if you are into pink-lemonade-cottoncandy-makeuplove-fashionseeking or simply if you like quirky places with a touch of princessy-magical charm, or if you looking to catch a glimpse of good views in Myeongdong and surrounding areas ~ overall, this place is just fun, so regardless, you will leave with a smile.Shop is pretty , and sells all stylenada stuff. Nice place for photo spot. Alot nice corners... but items are expensive so didnt buy anything therewent straight up to the cafe where they serves fanciful drinks with candy floss! Great to have candy floss that wont melt during the winter. Great texture. Drinks was ok. Due to the snow the outdoor sitting area was closed. We had to stay indoor. However staff attitude needs to be improved!Went to the one in Myeongdong, it was super crowded on the ground floor, but it was actually quite empty on the other floors (which sells the same cosmetics). Top floor was the rooftop area, not exactly clean, the pink and white pillows were kinda turning grey and no one was taking care of the finished drinks from previous customers. Blue cream soda was good tho.I went to this cafe accidentally since I was looking for makeup stuffs on the lower floor. Didn’t expect to be so “hotel-look” and “fancy”, I totally feel satisfied with the photos and moment I got there. Come at summer will be a lot better! There is also pool inside that you can take a photo with!We are very looking forward to visiting their shop since we are a big fan from Thailand. The store is very cute, well decorated with vintage pink hotel atmosphere. Sadly we got a bad service from the staff both at Stylenanda fashion and 3ce counter. The 3ce cashier put all the cosmetic in the bag carelessly that she accidentally dropped the cheek power that we are going to buy, she looked at it suddenly she just put it back. I asked for a new one and the answer is “it isn’t broken” check it! No sorry nothing... Such a disappointment. They decorate their shop so lovely that they may forget that SERVICE is also important.Centrally located in Myeongdong, this building features the beauty make up brand 3CE, a cafe at the top floor and each level is fitted with a different style of interior design, but around the main theme of a Hotel. It is a very interesting interior space and is worth a visit!"
명동 성당,"1,061건의<U+00A0>리뷰",서울 중구 명동길 74 (우) 04537,26위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"Nice place to visit. The interior is very impressive. Was a bit different to attend Mass in another language. Also a nice surprise to meet someone here who was also from my country.Nice and close to Myeong-dong.I'm elated that the Cathedral was full when the mass started. People cannot go in the church once the mass has started. There were mostly old people and their responses during the mass were simultaneous and synchronized. Though the mass was in Korean, my head felt lighter after the one hour solemn celebration.In terms of the Cathedral structure, one should see the gothic facade of the church if you're touring, shopping or trying street food around Myeongdong for the first time. It's located at the back end of the long street full of people from Myeongdong Station near the highway.Everytime I visit Seoul, I always dropby to say my prayers.Its a gothic cathedral near the Myeong-dong Street. Also its beautiful during autumn as the trees and plants changes their colors.While you visit this busy shopping area take a few minutes to check out this fine traditional church. Many Seoul churches inside are more like theatres but this is the real thing.The Cathedral sits on top of a Long flight of steps. Whenever i’m In Seoul i’ll Attend service there.Because the mayority of korean people deos the hinduisum of muslims and very But very little the catholic, near the su way sistemVery nice and quiet place in the center of Seoul. We discovered it during a Hop-On-Hopp-Off bus tour in the city - which we recommend very much - as you will see all major attractions during the tour.The cathedral is different to European ones but very nice!So nice to walk in on a Sunday evening.. An interesting and attractive building, over 100 years old, very close to the hubub of the street markets and shopping area. An oasis of tranquility that is well worth a visitlove this cathedral. the facade is lovely and is clean. One thing is not easy to find the cathedral...you have to go through a parking lot and through a mall, then take a lift up to the cathedral.it was an amazing old worship building. the other need church complex is very modern and well maintained. could get inside almost anytime. good place for taking picture for its european ambience. breathtaking places. likes to be there.and easy to find for its bell tower..."
숭례문,323건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 중구 세종대로 40 (우) 04528,82위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"Just down the main strip from Gyeongbokgung Palace is a junction that spilts in several locations and in the middle of this junction is an ancient gate called ""Sungnyemun Gate"". It is part of the ancient city wall that surrounded the capital of Seoul in the Josean dynasty and is one of the oldest remaining features of the wall in Seoul today. It is a great place to visit on the way to Namdaemun Market and there are daily activities at the gate including Changing of the Guard ceremonies which occur daily every 2-3 times in the day. You can get some photos with the guards at the end of the ceremony which makes for some great holiday photos.Sungnyemum Gate, one of the four main gates in Seoul’s former fortress wall, dates back to 1398. But this South gate has been rebuilt many times with the latest completion occurring in 2013. I was exiting the Nandaemun Market at Gate 1 when I first saw the structure and wondered why it looked so new. Designated National Treasure No. 1, it stands across the street from the market on a big traffic island in a modern section of the city, known for its tall buildings. When I went to investigate, I was delighted to find free pamphlets in English that give the gate’s history from the Joseon Period until the present.The gate features a stonework base, a two-tiered pagoda-shaped tile roof and a large archway in the center. A few guards in colorful traditional garb stood nearby and I soon heard distant drumming that came closer. It signaled the impending arrival of many men dressed traditionally in colors ranging from royal blue to bright yellow, complete with big hats and boots and carrying large flags. I had arrived in time for the free changing-of-the-guard performance at 11:40 a.m. Only a few others joined me, which was a welcome change from the huge crowds I encountered at similar productions held at Seoul’s palaces. After the short, less-than-10-minutes show, visitors could pose with the men for photos.As a history buff, I really enjoyed my stop here and the lack of tourists. The gate stands between Seoul Station and Seoul Plaza. It can be accessed by Subway Line 1, Seoul Station, Exit 4 and Line 4, Hoehyeon Station, Exit 5. Closed on Mondays.The Sungnyemun Gate was built between 1396 and 1398 and was part of the old Seoul City wall.It has been modified over the years and in 2008 the upper structure was destroyed by fire, but now restored. It is an interesting structure in a city mostly glass an concrete.It's in the middle of a busy square full of cars. So it's good to see it when you are just passing by and catch a quick photo.Better known as Namdaemun Gate, is one of the symbol of Seoul: One of the 8 gates of the seoul's Fortress.It was built in 1398 during the Taejo Reign.You can walk throught it and take pictures.It's interesting see an historical place like this at the center of traffic jam!You can take a quick visit before entering the Namdaemun Market.This gate near Seoul Station is one of the last remaining gates in the walls of ancient Seoul. The gate is located on an island in main road. Best viewed from a distance.One of the 4 main gates in Seoul, reconstructed many times most recently in 2008, Sungnyemun Gate is impressive and great for some photos, but not really much to do there. There is a changing of the guard to add some colour (I missed it, but had previously seen the change at Deoksugung - its only a 10 min walk from Deoksugung to Sungnyemun). It's a good place to start a visit to the Namdeamun Market (there is an underpass from Sungnyemun gate to the top of the markets. Worth a quick stop and photo opportunity. More photogenic than Dongdaemun Gate and easier to get a good angle.This is a reconstructed version of one of the original Seoul gates and a lovely one, at that. Probably not worth a trip, but when in the area, worth passing by.Of the 8 gates in this once walled city, this one was the oldest wooden structure in Seoul until an arsonist climbed up and set a fire which destroyed the wooden pagoda on top of the gate in 2008. It took 5 years and several million dollars to restore this National historic treasure. The Namdaemun Market nearby is named for this South Gate.Right next to Namdaemun market. I love that it’s randomly in the middle of quite a busy intersection. Stands magnificently. We saw the changing of the guards. There are toilets near by."

It was great. I am from New York so hearing the Godfather music and seeing Al Pacino, and Robert De Niro sitting down was a huge surprise and great experience. Also the room with the Presidents was priceless. There were even exhibits of Kings and the Pope. I especially enjoyed seeing Chinese National riding a Horse next to Napoleon. You can even ride a bicycle next to ET! I have not smiled and laughed as much in years.It was a warm day in Seoul on our day to visit the Palaces. We had a list of places to go to with our BTS edition of Discover Seoul Pass. This was one of the places to go to. It was cool and the place was full of figures of people we know, especially our Korean idols and famous leaders of the world.We took our time going from floor to floor and there were also other guests from our country, the Philippines. What was great about the place is that it was not just a museum of wax figures, they also had games and 3D figures you can have photo ops with. They also had a souvenir shop where we bought stuff of our idols ( G Dragon, LMH and KSH) It was a good afternoon for me and my son. We enjoyed it. We have been to a wax museum in HK but this was great because of our Kdrama and Kpop idols. Thanks Grevin Seoul, we had fun . Thanks too for sending souvenir photos through my email.Conveniently located near City Hall Subway station. It was easy to find. An opportunity to meet with many movie stars around the world.especially the Korean movie stars. An interesting wax museum...there were also digital games that you can play inside.I liked the Grevin museum, it was my first wax figures museum and I was really impressed with how real some of the statues looked. I had fun with Einstein and Steve Jobs at the pop quiz room and I enjoyed making photos with other celebrities like Al Pacino, Brad Pitt, Messi and the Queen. The museum has a section with only k-drama stars and k-pop artist and overall it was a fun day.If you have spare time, this is a good option. The place was pretty much empty when we were there & we received 20% discount with our MasterCard.Interesting museum to visit. However, the Asian stars doesn't look as realistic. We had fun playing with the interactive games though.Good place to spend an evening in Seoul. Some cool things to see and do here. Not a place to go multiple timesWe went there on Monday and I was surprised there was literally no other visitors but us. Around 4-5 people arrived later. Except taking photos you can also participate in some games at the museum which was kind of fun I think. They take your pics and send it to you via email later on. Also, the regular ticket price was 18kWon but you can get 10% discount if you pay with MasterCard.Worthwhile visit. You can go through the process of making your sculpture, makeup, costume and finally, taking picture.Like any wax museum, some figures look very realistic and some not. They also have some interactive activities for guests to participate so make sure you have more time to spend inside."

Truly a wonderful place for photographyI stopped by at the DDP at nighttime with some friends and it was a great visit. The architectural design of the plaza itself is so unique and definitely worth some photos. I believe they tend to have some exhibits are art programs here sometimes but you'll have to check out their website. There is a History Museum that you can check out as well with free admission.This is a very beautiful building, spanning multiple blocks in Seoul. Its architecture is unique and outstanding from every perspective. There are pianos in various locations, free to play. Around the back there is an upscale street clothing market.The building is very attractive in design. There are spaces for exchibitions in the building. There are art shops and restaurants as wellWhat an amazing building!! The little shops in DDP were really interesting and worth exploring. Spend a lot of time in there. Glad that interior is not overly clutter but kept clean and minimalistic. The outside was full of activities so it was worth a trip both inside and out.Was looking forward to coming here but after marvelling at the structure and sculptures outside we were a bit bemused by the inside. We only managed to find a cafe and then a huge hall which was empty except for a couple of Mormon brothers having a rest. Not sure what the point of the place is.It is a wonderful place to visit. Great architecture and atmosphere. They have different exhibitions.This is a fascinating building which looks great from pretty much any angle. There didn’t seem to be an awful lot to do there - a small shopping arcade & a gallery for exhibitions plus some historic remains in the grounds with a small museum - but we spent an hour or so there, then went and ate in the arcades nearby then came back once it was dark when it looked even better. It reflects the light from surrounding buildings & looks quite otherworldly. Well worth a brief visit.As an architecture buff, I found this plaza in Seoul to feature one of the most innovative modern structures that I have seen. I first visited the 7-level (4 above ground and 3 below) building during the day and was so impressed that I returned to introduce the center to my husband that night. Designed by architect Zaha Hadid, the futuristic construction exhibits no straight lines or right angles. Instead, it presents elongated, curvy forms, built with concrete and cloaked in 45,000 aluminum panels.At night, the center’s lights seem to glow from within. At certain exterior vantage points, its shape and silvery hue give the impression of what I imagine a giant spaceship to look like. The park next to the building further enhances the look. It holds 25,550 LED roses, which light up 5 minutes after sunset and are absolutely stunning. It was a magical experience to stroll here in the dark. Inside, the curves continue in long corridors and connecting stairways (there are also standard elevators). The center serves as a fairly new venue for design in Seoul, featuring an art hall, meeting space, a museum, a design lab and a design market. I visited the huge lab, which displays a variety of well-crafted items for sale and gives visitors the opportunity to meet the designers. We enjoyed a light dinner in one of the many eateries in the market, which is connected to the nearby Dongdaemun shopping centers.DDP, located in Downtown Seoul, is easily reached by subway. Take Line 2, 4 or 5 to Dongdaemun History and Culture Park Station and leave through exits 1 or 10.We visited here as a nice walk in the evening. don't miss this work of art on the beautiful architecture. there are so many great things about this building. obviously curvy outside is amazing. The interior and exterior, both are inspiring."

Almost no place to eat unlike other typical traditional markets.
It's not a place for tourists. But, just visit and take a look if you are interested.Great place to find everything you need for baking. Cake Boxes, decorator tips pans and more. Take some time to really shop as prices vary and some shops only sell in quantities of 100 or more.Market was across the street from the Gwangjang market and so we venture there after having exploring the food market.

Even our cab driver recommended Siloam as the better choice! The baths were relaxing, with the mugwort being my favorite, and the scrub was rejuvenating. My skin has never felt so silky and I regularly moisturize and exfoliate at home! After an hour in the baths, my boyfriend and I met up in the common areas to lounge on the mats before trying a 60-min massage. We definitely got our money and time’s worth! We wandered around and enjoyed snacks at the cafe before checking out the kilns. My boyfriend took a nap in the oxygen room while I rolled around in loess sauna. You could easily spend a whole night or half a day at this jjimjilbang (they even have a nap room). 10/10 would recommend and will return to next time we’re in Seoul!i got into incheon around 5:30 AM and couldn't check into my hotel in seoul until 3:00 PM. i knew i'd want a nap, so i googled spas and this one came up. i'm glad i came here because it was the perfect place to go post-14-hour flight.i came here from seoul station and walked over, they stored my luggage for me, i paid the fee (11,000 KRW...around $9 USD) and went up to the nap room for some peace and quiet. it was perfection. i got 2 hours of sleep without disturbance. i recommend using an extra blanket as a pillow, if you're like me and find the block pillows uncomfortable.after i slept, i went down to the baths, sauna, and pools. i got a full body scrub and oil massage for 35,000 KRW ($30 USD) and while i speak no korean, i was able to communicate effectively and did not feel awkward at all. as people mentioned, you're fully naked, so be prepared for that. the woman doing the scrub was friendly and efficient. i felt like a new woman after!after my scrub and spending some time in the baths, i rested my feet in a warm rock...thing? unsure what it was but 10/10 recommend lol. then i got food from the cafeteria area. i paid 10000 KRW for spicy pork and it was not only delicious, but came with generous portions for sides.all in all, it was an awesome experience! not particularly luxe, but definitely fantastic for the price.Nice traditional place, with lots of pleasant pools, a cascade and sauna with salt to scrub yourself. Also, the ladies who are massaging and scrubbing are amazing and it's not expensive. But the space itself is quite small and it's not easy to understand where things are. I think we missed some stuff because of lack of information.Average sauna in terms of its cleaniness. Pool was small. Have a number of different facilities which u cant find at the other sauna. The aunty selling food at level 4 was unfriendly when i ordered a binsu which tasted like ice-kachang. Overall average place.This is a very popular Korean spa(bath, thermal spa and more) for foreigners. Good to try if you visit Korea for the first time.- Putting luxurious spas aside, I think this is the best common Korean spa in Seoul.- 11,000 won was a very affordable price for the facility. It's even cheaper if you only take a bath.- Even though its reputation, it wasn't that crowded when I visited on Friday.- Don't forget to pick up a towel from B1F before you start enjoying yourself.- Some of chambers are too hot even for locals.- Most fun chambers are on the 4th floor and it's the most crowded floor.- Some locals visit here for a cheap overnight stay. Only for sleeping.- It's not necessary to get naked. Just skip bathing. No worries for foreigners.- Restaurant and snack bars looked pretty well-maintained.- Comic books are too outdated. I think they need to fetch recent ones more.When you searchs for spas in Seoul, the Dragon Spa was the most popular result and also guidebooks were singing praises of the Dragon Spa. However, the Dragon Spa attracted various reviews and I began to think it was a tourist attraction and over-priced.I initially approached concierge at my hotel to discuss the DRAGON spa but then one of the staff member at the concierge desk told me she had gone to Silloam which was more authentic and mostly locals went there.So on my last day I went to Silloam. They charge an entrance fee to use the baths approx 7,000 won or so but if you would like to use the additional rooms then its approx 11,000 won. On hindsight I should have just paid for the baths becuase they are separate for men and women. The other rooms are mixed.The baths are good with various baths st different temperatures. You will find in the baths a separate area where you will find women offering massages and body scrubs. I opted for a body scrub a massage with a face pack for 80,000 won which lasted for an hour. I loved my treatment and the woman administering my treatment was lovely and friendly. I left the spa feeling so relaxed and amazing. Later that day when I flew out back to London, I slept amazingly on the flight. I highly recommend this place and make sure you enjoy the baths first before opting for your treatmentCould spend hours in this place. They have everything you could need. Very relaxing. Please do research the customs before you go though so you know what to expect!I loved my experience at Siloam! My reccomendations are: read up ahead on jimjilbang etiqutte and process, and definitely ask the lady at the desk in the ladies' for a scrub + facial massage. Then go enjoy the different saunas before heading down to the baths. It's 60,000 wan very well spent.What a triumph. I’m not easily pleased when it comes to this sort of thing but truly brilliant.Don’t be a prude, the folk here are not there to look at you, just enjoy the liberty and let it all loose.Body scrub fantastic, massage even better and I’ve had massages all over the world, possibly the best I’ve had.Saunas, baths, etiquette, attitude all top drawer. Currently lying on a warmed floor in the jade room feeling very relaxed indeed.If you come here and don’t enjoy it, I’ll be amazed.My wife and I had a great time chilling out at Silloam Sauna. The place is very clean with multiple storeys of bath, saunas, massage and dining facilities. Their signature barley drink is a must try! If you’re looking for a nice place to spend a lazy afternoon, or just to experience the Korean jimjilbang, this place will not disappoint."
서울로7017,164건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 중구 청파로 432 Near Seoul Station and Namdaemun Market (우) 04509,84위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"A pleasant walk over the the hustle of the city. Markets are sometimes held as at the weekend. It has a nice view of Seoul station, especially if you want to watch the sunset over the city. Its also nicely lit after dark. Usually a few people walking about and taking photos, but never feels to busy.Like the New York Highline, this old roadway has been rebirthed as an above street garden walkway. As you proceed along, the vistas open out into a wide expansive view around Seoul station. If you’re lucky someone, maybe you, will be playing one of the several upright pianos stationed along the walkway. The gardens change as you walk through a range of plant species.It’s a bit like the NY Highline except more concrete. Nice way to get between areas of the city and avoid the traffic.A bit like the NY highline, this is an urban walkway created from a disused rail line that allows you to walk through the downtown area of Seoul unimpeded by traffic. What a simple but brilliant idea; I hope more cities copy it. There are pleasant features there (like a piano) to break the journey, it's a pleasant stroll you can pick up near Seoul station.Take the walk at night. The soft glow of the planters and occasional music along the way are good for the soul, an airborne oasis above the rush of cars and trains. During the days you may come across a player at one of the four or so pianos along the route. And the blooms are changing every week. Even umbrellas are provided for an oppressive summer sun. Thoughtful Korean designers at their best. Highly recommended.It's an urban garden that's above the roads. You get a good view of Seoul Station (both old and new). If you're trainspotter, you can look at trains coming in and out of Seoul StationThe walkway is not very long but nice, with interesting trees and many pianos, plus a few interesting views.A quirky elevated garden built on an overpass above the busy Seoul streets. They provide free umbrellas to borrow whilst enjoying the walk and protect yourself from the sun. There are plenty of different varieties of plants, a nice area where mist is sprayed to keep cool (plants and tourists alike) and was overall a nice place to visit without crowds to bother you.We were attracted by the lights at first, around midnight near our hotel in Seoul station. Taking those lighted stairs revealed at first a nice potted garden with each pot labeled with the latin botanical name for each plant. As we continued our walk, we found more than plants - it was a whimsical park, with working pianos, an embassy for an alien planet (where you can take official pictures behind the alien flag), trampolines, kids' drawing station, glass floors, and other rather amusing play areas - all free! Even late at night, the park felt safe - there are people walking through even after midnight. Also, the uniformed park keepers are still around late, with lighted red candlesticks in hand. This is an enjoyable place to walk, and it is most convenient when going from Seoul Station to Namdaemum or the Hoehyeon Station. Skip the traffic and take a walk in Seoullo - it will bring a smile to your heart!It is probably the most beautiful walk to take in the night. The old Seoul Railway station is in lit up and so is the new one, not to mention the sky walkway. It is such a wonderful place to wander. Simply go!"

남산골 한옥 마을,832건의<U+00A0>리뷰,서울 중구 퇴계로34길 28 (우) 04626,55위(933곳의 서울 소재 관광지 중),"My visit here occurred on my third time in Seoul and I did not regret missing it on my first two trips. Unlike other recreated villages I have gone to worldwide, this one offers only five traditional houses, which have been moved here. They provide a good cross-section of how Joseon Dynasty citizens lived, but none beckoned to linger; and no hands-on activities, such as wearing traditional garments, were available on an early weekday afternoon in November. Though there is no admission charge, the free access did not seem to stimulate interest, at least at this time of year. I saw only a handful of other visitors during my brief exploration. But this atmosphere proved to be a nice change from the crowds at popular tourist attractions, such as palaces. I enjoyed sitting by the pond here for a while and walking along one of the trails in the park at the rear of the complex.The village is near the Myeongdong area of Seoul. By subway, take Line 3 or 4, get off at Chungmuro Station and take Exit 3 or 4.This is a great place to spend the afternoon exploring and seeing the traditional style of living and shops. Really loved it here and It's free and easy to walk around.I loved this tour. The steep inclines and quaint houses and shops is reminiscent of our tour in Tuscany (on much smaller scale). So picturesque, I can understand the attraction for tourists. But I sympathize with the residents having to put up with us taking selfies in their doorways. We only stayed for about 30 minutes. It’s a real look into the history of South Korea.This Hanok village is easy to find and is walking distance from my hotel. The heritage houses are well maintained and is good to visit inspite of being free accessI didn't have high expectations as I went to Bukchon Hanok Village before; so reckon it'll be similar ie cafes housed in traditional houses etc. But at Namsangol Hanok Village (NHV) surprises me at every turn. First you can experience 1 hour sleeping time in the hanok (for a small fee). I thought that's a very refreshing experience in true sense of the word. Next you can rent traditional costume and take photos or pretend you're in a period drama and walk around the village. We also came across a gentleman who is a falconer and told us many information on this ancient heritage of korean falconry. The cafe nestled in the middle of the village is also very quaint and the souvenirs are worth looking at.We visited yesterday, 20/07/19, a family of 6 aged between 6 - 69. No entrance fee that we noticed. Information hut was on your immediate right after entry. Lovely clean toilets all the way round the area. This trip was throughly enjoyed by all. It was a nice steady walk around the village and gardens. Fun games for the children to take part in as you walk, including a stamp collecting map for the children to find stamps as they walk around. Lovely village and So clean and well taken care of. Some very large Koi fish in the lake which the children enjoyed watching. We could have hired traditional dress at the entrance but with the humid heat we would have struggled. I would happily go again for a lovely peaceful stroll.It’s very close to our hotel. Its a good place to visit, cultural heritage with traditional houses. Fresh atmosphere. 
It’s free access. Also its not so many people like other tourist attractions, so i like it.This place is a hidden jewel if you experience some of the traditional Korean culture. The park itself is peaceful and very walkable. One must try “Experience Korea” items at a nominal fee such as making bow and arrows, making crafts, making game pieces, rice cakes, etc. The instructors are people who are experts at these Korean traditions and passionate about sharing them.Just take a short walk from Chungmuro station and you will reach this village. Admission is free. We walked around the few traditional houses and the pond nearby. It is small but peaceful and not crowded. A great place for a stroll and photos.This is a good place if you want to know what Korean culture is like. They have a replica of a Korean village with the traditional furniture. There were demonstrations of Korean activities, ranging from Korean toys, make Korean rice dumplings and a Korean tightrope walker."

She even help us call out for online taxi to Science Museum. Thanks a lot...!Not a very big museum, just the right size. Free entrance and great place to showcase korean culture and technological marvel of south korea.This museum has many pluses. It is free, it is small, so you won't get bored, and the restaurant HAS THE BEST buckwheat noodles in all of Korea, for only 4000 won (4USD)Relatively modern museum (opened 2011), located adjacent to Ulsan Grand Park and easily accessible from downtown Ulsan. The permanent exhibitions located on the 2nd Floor are divided into two main Galleries; the 'History Gallery' showing the history and culture of Ulsan from prehistoric times up until the establishment of the Ulsan Industrial Metropolis and the 'Industrial History Gallery' concentrating on the development of Ulsan as an industrial centre from the sixties/seventies up until the present day.I certainly was unaware of the amount of prehistoric sites in the Ulsan Metropolitan Area and this visit to the museum prompted me to subsequently visit such sites, e.g.: the petroglyph rock art in nearby Ulju, etc. As a ""foreigner"" working in Ulsan, the Industrial History was of particular interest to me and I was drawn to the exhibits concerning the automotive industry (Hyundai Motor Company) and the Shipbuilding/Offshore Construction (Hyundai Heavy Industries). Don't miss the Hyundai Pony - Korea's First Original Model from 1979 (remember when wing-mirrors were actually located on the front wings!).Entrance to the permanent exhibitions is free. When I visited there was an exhibition of 'Egyptian Treasures from the Brooklyn Museum' in one of the two Special Exhibition Galleries for which they charged a fee (discounted for Seniors like myself). This for me was 'icing on the cake' in a thoroughly enjoyable visit which included a pizza lunch in the attractive Bistro/Cafeteria on the 2nd Floor.At time for my visit, there was exhibition of religious treasures of Israel and the guide was so kind to explain us all details and spent with us about an hour and draw our attention to the historical point. The Ulsan museum is well-established and location is very convenient just next to Ulsan Grand park.The Ulsan Museum which is very easily accessible is located adjacent to the Ulsan Grand Park, Nam-gu (further up from Gonguptap Rotary). Entrance is free for the general exhibits. Some exhibition areas are subject to a fee. Tickets can be obtained on the ground floor. The only downside is that most exhibits are in Korean language with minimal English translation. Improvements to the translation would have been very helpful.The museum educates visitors on the Korean cultural heritage and its subsequent industrialisation prowess. A children's interactive area (in Korean) is also provided. All-in-all, it's worth the visit as it gives you a good look at the Korean way of life.Housing in a building of really interesting, modern architecture, it is divided in two parts (excluding the temporary exhibitions): History and Technology. So, it demonstrates the past and the present of Ulsan area. It is not a must-see spot, however, if you have more time after your visit in Ulsan Grand Park, a pass through the museum will get you deeper inside in the early and modern history of the area. The most of the information is written only in Korean, however the museum staff is eager to answer your questions and to give you more information about the exhibits.Hint: there is a quite cute coffee shop at the second floor of the museum.Not a bad museum. It's not extremely large, but moderate sized. Of course being in Korea; the exhibit's are dominantly in Korean. The exhibit that I saw did contain a decent amount of English and there were many interesting artifacts on display.It helps you understand so much of Korean culture. Their history and AMAZING comeback after the Korean War is fascinating."

Morning or afternoon time will be perfect to visit this place.We passed by this area after our business tour for a short walk and sight seeing. I really recommend that you don't miss this park. From dragon statue playground to rocky cliff is about 10-15min walk. There are restaurants nearby. A breathtaking view on the cliff. Diving not allowed. We didn't see anyone swimming too. Rocky area.Such a beautiful area to walk about, it would take 3-4hours to walk around it all, little outcrops with bridges and walk ways absolutley stunning.take a bus no.104 is easiest because the bus stop at Daewangam entrance. Walk along the beach and take a photo with a nice view. You can try fresh seafood too"

Well worth the visitYou can access this beach while walking around Daewangam Park.Just follow the cliff walk.The walk around the cliffs is worth the efgort.A very popular beach and the park next to the beach has had a lot of work done to it in past years, well worth a walk through this parkWe enjoyed this beach area in December, but the open sewer going into the ocean was quite aweful.  Wonder why...더 보기The beach normally opens from mid-July till late August. So, the best time for you to visit the place is summer. There are facilities for children so that many people come in family unit. Also, adults can enjoy various water sleighs such as banana boat....더 보기Ilsan beach is situated near the Daewangam park area. It has a lot of choices for korean food, fine dining...더 보기Much less crowded that Haendae in Busan. Many foreigners use this beach since the Hyundai Ship yard is nearby so...더 보기The Ilsan beach is located in a bay between Hyundai vessel shipyard and Hyundai Heavy Industry yard.
Clean water, plenty...더 보기Yes, we had the perfect day: Blue sky but the view was amazing and people there were nice. There is no subways so you have to take the bus and that can be a little weird. Watched Brazil soccer game in the bus because it...더 보기Definitely one of the most beautiful places in Ulsan district. Perferct jogging and walking pathways"
간월재,18건의<U+00A0>리뷰,울산 울주군 상북면,14위(56곳의 울산 소재 관광지 중),"The name ‘Ganwolsan’ means a sacred mountain like ‘Sinbulsan.’ As high as 1,069 m, it has steep rocky cliffs on the east and highlands with gentle slopes on the west. In early August, the mountain lily blooms and creates a mystique view in harmony with the short silver grass around the peak.Ganwolsan is a favorite place for many hikers to watch the silver grass in autumn. The wide silver grass plains in the altitude of more than 1000m offer special points of interest, unlike other mountains.In the fall of the Yeongnam Alps, where the silver grass makes their appearance in the autumn, the Ulju Odyssey, the mountain concert, the mountain marathon, and the mountain climbing tournament are held every year.I would recommend to hike the Sinbul mountain and Ganwol Mountain from the Youngnam Alps Complex Center.You can also see beautiful eulalia yard."

Great for long walks and family outings.Shinbulsan has great hiking trails with easy as well as more advanced options. There is plenty of natural scenery to be found at Sinbulsan. It's the perfect place to get out of the city for some fresh air.30 minute walking distance from the parking lot. Very nice and calm place. Surroundings are very beautiful. Enjoyed it. Good place for the people who love nature and hiking.An interesting complex. in the middle of nowhere (so to speak) a huge car park, a Korean theater and access to one of the beautiful areas to walk. Excellent parking and good walking, nice waterfall. gets a bit crowded on Sundays"
태화강 십리대밭,121건의<U+00A0>리뷰,울산 중구 태화동 107,2위(56곳의 울산 소재 관광지 중),"The easiest way to get to Taehwagang National Garden is by cab. The garden houses an incredibly vast garden. Bright yellow flowers were in full bloom during my visit. Silver grass reeds magnificently rose proudly in the afternoon sun. On the other side of the garden over the wooden bridge is the Bamboo Forest, which is definitely worth a visit. And a walk along the Taehwa River is highly recommended.While you walk in the bamboo grove, you would feel you are far away from a city. You would hear birds chirping, wind touching leaves and children laughing. This grove stretches over 4km along the riverside and there are a few other gardens you can visit as well.If you happen to be in Ulsan, this place is worth a visit.If you love to visit a non touristy and cool Bamboo Forest, this is definitely the one you're looking for! Take some time to indulge in nature!If you are in Ulsan and happen to have a few hours to spare, you could consider this.Quite cooling if you walk inside the grove.Getting here can be complicated though. This was my route:- Ulsan Express Bus Terminal- Cross the road and walk to bus stop on the left- Bus 407 to Taehwagang Observatory- Walk down a path at the petrol station to a white building and turn right at the end- You will reach the river. There is a small ticket booth. Get a ticket for the boat at 1000KRW. The boat is special. Pulled by hand on a suspended rope. Apparently it was the way in the old days.There is the National Garden across the bus stop earlier.not only bamboos worthes to be visited : very large park with nice various gardens a small marsh with white heronsThis is about a 5 block walk off the bus line on the main drag to the forest. There is a vistor center and fountain with a pond. The entrance to the forest is nearby and takes you on a 15-20 minute walk through the forest. There are online games/activities for kids, sections of the forest are illiuminated at night, and one activity where you squeeze between sections of bamboo. If you are walkers, you can exit the forest and cross the bridge on the river and walk to the foutain cave complex across the river. Transportation options from there are slim if you do no0t plan on walking back.Big Bamboo park. Bicycle for rent and a lot of space for picnic... you can spend your free time hereone of other good places in ulsan ,by river side. must try cycle ride .good place for evening walk with familyYou can visit this bamboo area as you are in the surrounding park.There is a short walk through the bamboo for a photo.Then you can explore the surrounding park area.It is not a must see place.Plenty of free car parking.I wasn't in this city travel plan, but I'm glad I went. especially the riverside walking track is very well arranged and intertwined with nature.I saw this in Japan similar to the bamboo forest, but this place is not bad either."
인천공항 환승 투어,495건의<U+00A0>리뷰,인천,2위(7곳의 인천 소재 교통편 중),"I booked this transit tour to GwangMyeoung cave in the morning. It's very easy to go to the transit tour counter on the arrival hall on terminal 2 then just showed my booking and my boarding of connecting flight then our group of 8 people with korean tourguide boarded bus to terminal 1 then going to this woderful cave with history of Japanese soldiers history when they invaded korean peninsula , now it transformed into entertaiment park, with aquarium, light and sound showcases in the cave, wine storage chamber and etc. It's courtesy for transit passengers from korean government tourim for organising this free tour.I had a 13 hour layover in Seoul and was interested in seeing the city a little. I did some checking with people who know Seoul and decided to try to visit one of the famous market areas. When I got to the airport I saw the Transit Tour booth and checked it out. It offered various tours to sites like the Castle in Seoul, some temples, and shopping tours ranging from 1 to 5 hours. They are free! All the time I was on the tour ( to the castle) I was expecting to have to pay some exhorbitant price to get my suitcase back from underneath the tour bus, but no there was no catch, it is FREE! While the schedule for the afternoon shopping tour did not fit my available time, I was able to take a 5 hour tour with about 25 other people on a tour bus with a tour guide who explained things while we were on the bus and kept track of us when we were off the bus.Could be better signposted in the arrivals hall, after you've cleared immigration - best to walk the length inside the arrivals hall, past all the doors, looking for the transit tour desk. Once booked and joined, very well organised. The young man we had as our guide was excellent. The caves were a revelation; beautifully lit.This airport is worth a stop just to see the airport it’s is very very clean newer architecture was over all super fantastic airport they do a great job with signs and English if you’re not from there.Once you exit out of arrival door, you can easily find the booth to book the tours. You can pick and most of them are free except one of them you have to prepay KRW. I would suggest you bring some cash so you can buy souvenirs while exploring Seoul. The bus is very efficient and on time getting back. The tour is very nice and tour guide had limited English but it was understandable. We came back from Thailand and didn’t have any warm jacket and it was in February in Korea. The tour had puffy winter jackets to borrow!Please check out the free transit tours laid on at Seoul Incheon airport.I visited the above temple in 2017, and their itinerary has changed since then. However, Seoul goes out of its way to sell South Korea to transit passengers in the hope they will become tourists, and it works.I have found Incheon airport (on my frequent visits) to be characterised by cleanliness, efficiency, and first class service to passengers. The transit tour I took was no different. They check your ticket to make sure you have sufficient time for your selected tour; it runs to time and is interesting; it was free of charge.This tour was the shortest one (all I had time for) and we had about 30mins at the temple to look around. That was enough to get a flavour of the culture and some great photos, I really enjoyed it.Pretty well run tour. The one we took had a charge of usd10 per person I think for food while the tour was free. It's not easy to locate the booth to sign up as it depends where your arrival gate is. So if you cant find it when you arrive dont worry. Clear immigration and walk out. The booth is in the middle of the outside area before you exit the airport. Just choose the tour that suits your time and away you go. There are various ones with different length of time. Tour guide also speaks English and it's pretty straight forward.Waiting outside the door of the Incheon airport with around 50 other people trying to get onto the buses is no thrill, and it takes around 40 minutes to an hour drive to get to Incheon!This was such a great tour. It was so worth it, lovely guide - English speaking, lovely scenario and beats the hours of waiting at the airport. The guide was also kind enough to inform us of the free showers and nap zones in transit lounge which made the transit experience even better. I did the Gyeongbokgung palace and Insadong lunch tour, the palace tour was beautiful and there was time to walk around the streets of Insadong after the lunch. Lunch wasn't fancy but it was good enough.I can't rave enough about this free tour! We went August 21st with our 4 children 13,11,11and 8 years old. I'm glad we reserved it online months in advance because they were booked solid. Theres limited seating. I do believe 2 people on standby did get on but if you have a big family you will not get on without reservations.Our tour guide was funny and informative! The drive over there went by fast because you get to see the scenery and she explains so much. We went through the palace quickly with her and no you don't want to be left behind because time is of the essence and they have it down to a science. But she leads you through it and explains every part of the palace. She'll even take your picture. The lunch was fine. I loved it but I love bi bim bap. It wasn't the best I've had but I loved the experience. My kids didn't eat any of it however and there were no other options. We paid by credit at the tour counter hoping my kids would eat something which was plain rice. Expensive rice I tell ya but I knew that. Afterwards we had very little time to shop about 30 minutes. It was a fast paced tour, go into it with that in mind. Also, I read many of the reviews on here so I knew that after I got off the plane I had to go to the transit tour desk first before going through customs. Then you have to go to the terminal transit desk again. It was all smooth. No problems. I highly recommend this tour. Check out the airport too if you have time. Most amazing airport besides Changi in Singapore!"

If you want to stay away from busy city life, here would be a perfect place.I had sleep problem but surprisingly during my stay here I could have sound sleep. I don't know why.. I guess probably because of fresh air and healthy food. If you are interested in Korean style Buddism and want a peaceful time, I recommend you to visit here.What you can do-Comparing old and new types of Buddha statues-Having tea time with Buddhist monk-Joining morning or evening service-Walking around the walls (Interestingly this oldest temple in Korea is located inside walls that are know to be built by three sons of Dangun, legendary founding father of Gojoseon)-Enjoying beautiful trees and flowers (I saw many wild flowers I had seen in pictures)-Enjoying Korean traditional tea at the cafe Jukrimdawon.-Playing with catI visited Jeondeungsa Temple using the Free Korea Tour group the airport had provided. This one hour visit to the temple was fascinating. The colors, the architecture, the significance, all were very unique. Knowing its historical significance was interesting. The temple itself is located uphill. It's a very peaceful and quiet place. One can definitely do a lot of meditating here.Situated inside a small fort on a hill, the temple complex consists of a number of small halls in a serene wooded setting. There are some beautifully manicured trees around and I understand they also have accommodations for people wanting to stay for awhile. There is also a restaurant at the foot of the hill. Although not one of the more visited temples, it is pretty old and probably a better way to experience a serene Korean temple.The temple is uphill and quiet. If you are looking for a place to get away from noise and city headache then this place is highly recommended. I joined the temple stay program at Jeondeungsa temple which included 2 days and 1 night. It was an amazing experience and I will definitely go back againThis is a must place to visit if you have not been here before. Great Temple with a lot of beautiful buildings and sculptures.I went alone and I really enjoyed. This Buddhist temple is so beautiful and I just discovered u can stay there!Was visiting on our last trip to Korea, nice and quiet place, wasn't full of tourist. Nice walk through the park.I spent 3 nights at Jeondeungsa and was so sorry to leave. It was absolutely heaven for me and I highly recommend it. I did the free style Temple-stay and so I was up each morning at 4 for 4.30am prostrations (bowing ceremony) with the monks who were chanting. I loved every minute and found the chanting of the monks really touching, it was so beautiful. The monks didn't speak much English but there were guides and volunteers who did and who also translated when speaking with the monks - during some of the other ceremonies and when having tea with a monk.The peace and tranquility were simply wonderful and I highly recommend this place, it has had a profound impact on me.This temple is a wonder. You enter the real Korean spirit with typical buildings, well decorated in a sober but wonderful way.The entrance is free as almost everywhere in Korea!"

Outside there is a boating pool/ swimming pool in season, and an artificial surface sledge run A great day out for the familyGreat day out for children. Situated on the island of Kanghwado, about 1 and a half hours' drive from the capital Seoul. The center has an indoor area dedicated to.... Space and aviation.

We both enjoyed the hike immensely. The views were spectacular...at one point were walked through mists that made it seem otherworldly. The people we met on the way were friendly and welcoming. Looking forward to other hikes in South Korea.Gyeyang Mountain is easy to find just walk up the hill from Gyesan Station (Incheon Line 1). There are few shops along the same road to buy supplies.The mountain can be busy on weekends and a little tricky for those not used to hiking.Nice views across Northern Incheon await those to complete the climb.

You can enjoy fresh raw fish there. If you want to eat it, just buy fresh fish from a fishmonger, get it to the fish center, then a lady working there prepares it as sashimi with a little side dishes.Definitely worth the visit. Busy market full of fresh, dried and cooked seafood. Just don't ask what I ate... as there is absolutely no English in signs, your best bet is to point.If your going to south Korea you have to stop in Incheon for a day or 2 and experience the Sorae pogu fish market. It's a must see and must eat place. See the pics I posted to get a taste of this seafood carnival.While visiting Incheon check out the Polo Tourist Hotel, excellent hotel top quality, highly recommendedWe had about half day at Incheon for transit so we decided to visit this local fish market. It was GOOD choice!You find many fish shops and restaurants. You pick fish at shop, ask them to make it sashimi ( raw fish) and bring it to restaurant and eat. Such fun!! Not only sashimi but you can enjoy full of fish... start from raw, then to hot kimchi soup! Many people were enjoying picnic... they eat outside what they buy at market. We saw many cyclists eating here, it seems an hour or so ride fom city centre of Seoul so many seem to come here by bike and enjoy good fresh seafood lunch. Such a good idea!!The thing is... it's not that simple to come here from Incheon AP. We took bus to a certain train station and then reached Soraepogu station, where the market is. Kindly a clerk at Incheon AP tourist office advised us how to get here so you can ask them, too."

It can be a full day visit starting from museum, easy walk to the fish market and surrounding parks. From the market, it is only minutes walk to the entrance.

You can see it from almost anywhere in the park.Been here on 3 seasons and they are amazingly beautiful in different ways. Pink on Spring because of the cherry blossoms but it only lasts for few weeks. Vibrant on Summer but too hot for me to stroll on unshaded areas. Sunset colors on Fall! I dislike winter so we haven't tried it. We were able to set-up our tent in an area with other families. We read while kids take a nap.This is a beautiful park established by the city of Incheon. There are both bike paths and pedestrian walkways. Families are able to camp there in tents already set up. There are wonderful panoramic views of the skyline and hills. A cooling steam full of fish runs through the park that make for a tranquil walk. The larger pond is a place where one can sit and rest overlooking the vast landscape of many varied plants, tree, and flowers. There is a book nook on the plaza where books can be had for free.We have experienced this park in Summer and now Winter. We look forward to visiting during the Spring and Fall this year for cherry blossoms and fall colors.This is a large park with a beautiful rose garden in full bloom when we visited early Summer. The lake (artificial?) was wonderful to work along with tall trees lining the way. In Winter, we discovered snow sledding in the park which our young boys loved! The slopes were gentle enough for young thrill seekers and attendants were kind and warm.The one negative is the so called zoo. Don't expect much especially if you compare that to the one in Seoul Grand Park. However as someone living just 30 minutes away, this is a must go for kids to run wild and have fun.We took a shuttle up the hill to have a high ground overview of the various invasion landing sights. It has completely changed from the time of the invasion.추억의 장소 인천 대공원, 인천에서 태어나고 자란 분들은 다 알죠. I've lived in Incheon since I was born, so for me and other Incheoners around my age, this place is definitely a memorable and unforgettable place. when I was in kindergarten, elementary school and even in high school, we used to have a picnic at this park. oh, and also with my family too. still you might be able to see many children having a picnic here.It was spring when we visited the Grand Incheon park. It was a little late but our Korean friends insisted on visiting this park so we could at least see some sites in Incheon as opposed to just staying overnight in hotel. There were cherry blossoms all over the park. It was chilly that evening but I could imagine the place is a a beauty to see day time. There was a man made lagoon and I am sure this is a picture perfect place."

We took the KTX from Pohang to Seoul and took the AREX Express Service to reach Incheon Airport. The ticketing is easy and reasonable. It takes 46 mins to reach the airport. The ride is comfortable with very spacious Toilet and complimentary water bottle. Theres an electric cart service at airport from 7am to 7pm- complimentary to passengers of AREX Express passengers. Don't forget to return the ticket card at destination and take your 500Won!We decided to stay in Seoul for two nights on our way home. Rather than carry heavy bags around the city we booked a hotel in Onseo which is close to the airport. We bought T-money cards at the airport which meant we could initially use the AREX all stop train to get to our hotel (10 minute journey). The next 2 days we used then AREX alll stop train to get in and out of Seoul from Onseo (40 minutes each way) and do all of our sightseeing. The T-money card could also be used on the subway so it meant getting around the city was easy, it is also very cheap. AREX was clean and quick with plenty of space for suitcases so it was perfect for us.Arex save us alot of time while we were very tiring and lost direction.The journey from Seoul Airport to Seoul is about 30-45mins and very comfortable train.It is better to buy online first and redeem your ticket at machine. Easy redeemption with no extra cost. As around if you are unable to find the machine.First, please know there are TWO types of Airport Trains. One is LOCAL and stops at all the stations between Incheon (the city) and Seoul. The other is almost non-stop to Seoul Station (stops once? before Seoul Station..IDK, I'm usually napping). I'm reading various reviews from people who are obviously getting on the wrong train type and complaining how slow it is (SMH, geez) or how it doesn't stop locally. I don't think people realize the airport is 50 KM away from the city center. And Seoul, like any big city, has traffic. All. The. Time. So yeah, less than 60 minutes to the city center is ""fast."" The signs to either train are clearly marked ""express or local"" (with arrows). From your terminal, follow the signs to the AREX station. Once there, you can stand in line for the ticket counter or just buy your ticket via the machine (press ENGLISH if you want instructions in English people!) Pay 9K KW via credit card/bank card or cash. You get a reserved car AND seat # which is clearly printed on your receipt. You get a credit card looking ticket with a 500 won deposit charge. Once the gate is open (yes, there is a designated boarding time which is CLEARLY displayed by the entrance), swipe your card, find your seat, sit down. There are busses, cars, taxis, but this is probably the cheapest and fastest way for 1 to 2 people. If you are a large group, then maybe 9K KW per person is too much collectively. There is a luggage area in each train car. Once you arrive in Seoul Station, swipe your card to get out, and then go directly to the machine about 10 feet away from the exit to return the AREX card and get your 500 KW deposit back. From Seoul Station, you can easily switch to the Seoul Metro system. The last time I took it (November 2019), I walked to the AREX station at Terminal 2 at 4:55 AM, bought my ticket at the machine in 30 seconds for the 5:15 AM Express train and boarded at 5:05 AM. Was there a chance I might have ""just missed it"" and had to wait for the next train? Sure, but that's life, and I have no control over how long passport control might have taken.We (a group of 6) booked our tickets through klook.com because they were much cheaper than buying them directly from the counter. Klook will then send us a voucher through email, and with the printed (or mobile friendly) voucher, we exchanged them for tickets from the ticket counter at the train station in the airport building. Very easy and convenient. YOu have to pay KW500 in cash for each ticket (as security for the return of the ticket, which is in a credit card format). Upon arrival at your final destination (for us, it was the Seoul Main Station), we slotted our card-tickets into a ""Return"" machine and got back our KW500 deposit each.The train that we took was a non-stop one because it is faster. They also have one with multiple-stops, so, make sure you buy the correct ticket. Overall, it is a convenient and fast way to get to central Seoul. Not the cheapest - if you want that, go for the bus, but be prepared to be stuck in a traffic jam!Overall, we have a positive experience with AREX. There was sufficient place for us to store our big luggage and hand luggage. Highly recommended!!We had a 20-hour layover at ICN airport and decided to make the most of it by taking the AREX train into Seoul to explore the city.The train was fast (~45 min) and easy to navigate from the airport (take the express train if you're going to Seoul Station, the commuter train takes ~60 min). The experience was super easy thanks to the friendly staff at the ticket booths and free WiFi on board. There are airport buses that take you to Seoul but I prefer AREX because it is the fastest / most reliable option since traffic can be unpredictable.I bought ticket to Seoul Station. Then I realised I could get onto the airport railway without exiting Seoul Station. There was no staff and no extra ticket machine on the way. When I arrived at Unseo station, there is a fare adjustment machine. It told me how much fare adjustment upward is needed. I added the value to my one way ticket and I exited successfully. I think this measure is helpful for travellers in a hurryI just arrived in Incheon last Wednesday and so far I have caught the AREX from Unseo station to Seoul Station/Hongik University station and vice versa. The train is quick and efficient. There is lots of room for people and their suitcases, and the announcements on the train are made in Japanese, Chinese, Korean and English. There are two services - one which stops at all AREX stations from ICN to Seoul and one that goes express. Each takes between 40 - 50 mins respectively. The AREX is a great service and I recommend it.We took the express train from Seoul Station to Incheon and with reserved seats. It is much more comfortable than possibly having to stand up with other options.I got in a train to Busan, realizing that I didn't have my backpack with me. I tried to remember where I lost it but I couldn't really.. I thought it was in the waiting area or on the platform. So after reaching out to the train staff they contacted different people. After 15 minutes I got a response that my backpack was in an AREX train, the one I got from the airport! So they found it safely and I can come get it. I was so relieved, everyone was super helpful and nice! Thank you again <U+2728>"

We spent whole day at this place as more than 50% of their shops have some very good deals. Some deals are not even displayed so there is good awards for pile diggers.Foodcourt has many great choices, and Metro takes you straight to the heart of this outlet.Highly recommended shopping experience.Safe place to sit and while away the time. Free Wi-Fi. Unless you want expensive shops, this is not the place to come. Good food court.The feel of the outlet is that it is relatively new, so there are empty spaces as you walk through. The food court has some good chains and has a good variety of offer.I. Love. This. Outlet. It is my favorite outlet in all of Korea. They have amazing restaurants and stores with style, and you can go here yourself, with kids, with the elderly, with family, with anyone!I couldnt find it in Trp advisor. But do really want to share the experience. Well, CU shops are something like DAISO but smaller. They are very famous in Incheon, South Korea.Usually I shop at CU which is in the Any Ocean Building. In the evenings the cashiers are youung people, if Im not mistaken 1 guy and 1 girl. They are OK. But in the morning a pretty old lady works there and she is quite aggressive. I bought coffee powder and usually koreans can make coffee inside the shop, but she refused to give me the cup. I even said that I can buy it but she refused. I really liked Incheon and the majority of people are very friendly. But cant help and must say that such situations darken the whole perception.This place you could spend a whole day easily. The outlets have excellent prices and plenty to choose from. There must be around 100 shops from sunglasses to premium Sports shoes everything you want top to bottom. I really enjoyed the bakery but sadly I only had 2.5 hrs but needed 6. I would like to come back.From sports clothes to luxury items, this was an outlet mall that offered more than the usual fare of outlet goods, Prices were fair, choices outstanding. Amazing food court.If you happen to be in the Songdo area, make sure to visit the Hyundai Outlet. It has everything you could think of <U+2014> restaurants, cafes, chain stores, famous brands, etc.Shops are kind of high end, food choices from Premium Market food hall at the basement are great. There is a Champion gym where you can drop off the kids (younger kids need to be accompanied, but if your kids are between 7 - 12, they should be able to explore on their own and have fun) for a couple of hours, so you can take time to shop around. In the neighbourhood, you will find Triple Street and Plus Mall for brands such as Zara and the likes, so cheaper option. The mall is 30mins taxi ride from Incheon airport, so if you have a day to kill, not a bad idea, as for Metro station, it is right at Techno Park.Hyundai Premium Outlet Songdo , Divided into 2 zones. The area is wide enough. There should be at least 5 hours."

It is located at the Songdo International District, one of the foreign-friendly area in Incheon. The uni is well-known as a location of the K-drama named 'My Love from the Star' whose main actor, Kim Suhyeon, and main actress, Jeon Jihyeon, were into. The buildings of the uni are new and clean. Due to the city planning policy of the district, the design of the buildings at the district is different and unique from that of other places in Incheon.Try the excellent espresso in the little bakery shop. Friendly service, excellent pastry and sandwhiches. I go there on every business trip at least once.I think this university is a new one since Songdo is a new district but I may be wrong.Anyway it has a super nice looking and is going to be a very useful universities for local but also foreigners who will stop in this new international district.This university located at on the verge of ocean and having amazing nature around it. Multi-cultural environment makes it nice place to work.This is a great a HUGE campus for Asia. It is very pretty with lots of flowers in spring and summer.

인천 상륙 작전 기념관,104건의<U+00A0>리뷰,인천 연수구 옥련동 525,9위(163곳의 인천 소재 관광지 중),"We visited this imposing memorial on the hop on hop off bus.It can be reached by local bus as well.There are several bronze memorials to the US Marines and South Korean army and an amphibious tractor and artillery displayed.The attached museum gives an interesting account of the 1950 Incheon landing that defeated the Communist North Koreans in the Korean War.It is a very informative museum with everything you need to know about the most significant event during the Korean War. However, most displays haven’t changed in years and they can use some improvement.As a former member of the United States Marine Corps who in 1958, after the war, was attached to the 1st Marine Division, I wanted to see this museum at all costs. To do this, I got my wife and myself a hotel room for three nights at the Incheon International Airport so we would be relatively close to the museum. I studied how to get to the museum and off I went from our hotel on the Number 304 bus. I had planned to transfer to the number 8 bus but I simply could not figure out the connection after I left the number 304 bus. So I hired a taxi (U.S. $8). Money well spent. I don't think I would have ever found the museum off the number 8 bus. I also hired a taxi to return to catch a number 303 bus back to the airport.Every S. Korean won I spent, and every minute it took to visit the museum, were well worth the cost and the effort. The museum is FREE and it did not disappoint me in any shape or form. I began by visiting the exterior exhibits. Then I went inside to see the displays in the Memorial Hall. It was an outstanding and a deeply moving visit for me. Would a visit be for everyone? No. I feel you must have a sincere interest in the Korean War to enjoy the museum.BUT, immediately next door, just down the street, is The Incheon Metropolitan City Museum. I really enjoyed this Trip Advisor attraction a lot. So it is a very worthwhile attraction to visit even IF you are not interested in the Korean War.Bottom Line : How can you go wrong with two great attractions next door to one anotherThis memorial is dedicated to the US beach landing at Incheon which helped turn the tide of the Korean War to the US/ROK favor. Lots of good military history here.This museum is a must for military war buffs. If you have any interest at all in the Korean War, this is the 2nd best place to visit in the Seoul area besides the excellent Korea Military Museum in Seoul. The Incheon Landing was the key to saving South Korea during the Korean War. It was risky but perfectly executed. The museum describes everything in detail. Several statues also show respect for this battle. The museum is quite a walk from the metro station but I managed. It takes about 30 minutes. It might be worth looking into a bus or taxi if you don't want to walk so far.It was a nice smaller tribute to the war. I enjoyed the putdoor and in door stuff, well laid out. As an american visiting it was nice to see the view from an in country exhibitbest time to go at evening, i happened to go there because I participated in walking event in summer, and the other time, because I want to see tulips to take a picture during springI loved the displays and historical artifacts from the Incheon Landing. But I definitely love the beach landing representation of where the allied ships are, the troops, the aircrafts, it's totally amazing how the Koreans made this! Very well done and gives honor to the sacrifice and bravery of the Allied forces and their South Koreans who have fought and paid the price for their freedom. You should check it out. Free admission and parking. We parked toward the upper street above the museum.I have been in this place several time, historically important for Koreans, but except for the memorial itself there is nothing so spectacular about the place.Another great memorial dedicated to the people involved in the Incheon landings. The memorial hall is very informative and its worth having enough time to go through. There are a few military displays of vehicles and replicas of critical moments during the landing. We caught a city bus from Songdo where we were staying."
인천 대교,345건의<U+00A0>리뷰,인천 중구,2위(163곳의 인천 소재 관광지 중),"In the 8 years I lived in Korea, I crossed the bridge at least 15 times on Airport runs. It is truly impressive. I will be crossing again in the next few days, and it is something I am looking very forward to. It is a real showpiece of Korean engineering and building know-how.I draw bridges for construction so crossing this iconic bridge twice was a real thrill. It crosses the bay from the airport to Incheon and is well lit at night.Amazing treasure of South KoreaTruly a beautiful master piece. Engineering feat a beautiful site at nightI had just spent the afternoon visiting two Trip Advisor attractions in Incheon and I was riding the Number 303 bus heading out to the Incheon International Airport when what to my wondering eyes should appear ahead of me but this absolutely amazingly wonderful bridge. So out came my trusty camera and I snapped several photos of the Incheon Bridge, here in Incheon, South Korea. What a wonder of creative design and construction. I wonder how many people ride the bridge and totally ignore its beauty.I was on an airport bound bus and did not have to pay any toll fees. I don't know about automobiles and other vehicles traveling across the bridge as to paying tolls or other fees to cross the bridge.Well , coming from Italy where 10 meters long bridges collapse it’s even more incredible... this is wow. Beside I just crossed by bus I was shocked how ling and steady isIt is amazing what the peple doing to cross over the seas ..... amazing bridge, especially night time ...We enjoyed the view from out hotel Premier Incheon and we had nice drive with taxi as well. It is very modern and very long.This bridge is a feat of engineering. It is one of the longest bridges in the world. On clear days it offers amazing views of the sea and islands along the coast. You can also see beautiful views of Incheon. It is also the quickest way to get from Songdo to the international airport and vice versa. If you are driving keep in mind that you will have to pay a toll. If taking a taxi, the driver will add 3,000 to 4,000 won to your tab.Great fun to drive on this bridge with nice view of ports, terminals and cities on the horizon. Great to see sunset and sunrose on a clear day.Not really an attraction. We crossed this bridge every day for a week back and forth. It is amazing with views from both sides of the car. Toll road to cross. Goes from airport to different area of Incheon. Feels like you are in the future around here."
차이나타운,585건의<U+00A0>리뷰,인천 중구,8위(163곳의 인천 소재 관광지 중),"Nothing particularly interesting. Many Chinese restaurants selling Korean style Chinese food for sure! But why come here for Chinese food? Never mind if it is just a convenient stop to avoid traffic jam back to Seoul.If you think this is what Chinese culture looks like, you clearly do not know much about it. Incheon Chinatown looks like a fake, a movie set, similar to the China Pavilion in Epcot. The streets lack diversity and honestly the entire area gives me the creeps. It is just weird and does not feel alive. Do not recommend.China Town is near the sculpture zone and Japanese concession.It is small enough to see in an hour.We bought Chinese pastry's and Sugar cane juice.There are lots of interesting shops and restaurants.It is directly opposite the main station.This is a far better than the most to China Town I have visited. It was clean and good service then the food was great.It's a subway ride from Seoul.I highly recommend a visit if you are in ROK.China town was a great experience, loved the mural painted on the wall of the great Korean war historyHaving been to Chinatowns in London, San Fransisco and Seattle this was somewhat disappointing after about an hour's trip on the metro.It's a good place to visit in Incheon! There're also nearby places for sight seeing and take photos.Nice fairytale land, almost all corners of the street are themed, you can go around the whole area take photos for 2-3hrs.While this Chinatown is very small when compared to those in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco it packs a lot of style and atmosphere in it's relatively small area. As you exit the Incheon Metro station you are greeted by the 30 ft gate across the street. The roads are lined with various shops and restaurants as one would expect to see in any Chinatown. As mentioned the streets are very hilly. You will get a work out walking up and down to explore all the streets. If you rather climb stairs just go right by the gate walking heading south along the main street until you come to the entrance by the Japanese section by the Art Platform. Walk up the street to a small park dedicated to the boundary between the Chinese and Japanese settlements in Incheon. Climbing the stairs you reach the statue of Confucius. To your left will then be the Three Kingdoms Mural. From there you can walk back down towards the shops and restaurants or you can continue straight uphill to Jayu Park where there is a nice view of the port. Jayu and Chinatown are very photogenic parts of Incheon.i have quite the expectation since i was travelling from seoul just to visit the chinatown of south korea (and the other stuff around) and my conclusion is - it's worth a trip if you are also visiting the other area. there are many restaurants and shops selling food and other stuff. They’re a lot of buildings, nice to take pictures. The mural is a bit of a let down because they’re all in korean and chinese, so if you can’t read them - too bad. They look good but gets repetitive (kinda boring). but there are other stuff to visit!"
스파온에어 인천국제공항점,153건의<U+00A0>리뷰,인천 중구 공항로 271 인천 국제 공항 터미널 B1 동편 (우) 22382,1위(46곳의 인천 소재 스파 / 웰니스 중),"Spa on Air / Jimjilbank (Terminal 1, Basement)B1 Eastside IncheonIt's in Terminal 1, downstairs (B1)It's a very simple one with, for the men, 3, 39 degrees centigrade tubs, two saunas co-ed saunas (only one somewhat hot)a sleeping room, and showers.it takes a solid 20 minutes to get the shuttle from Terminal 2, after you exit customs. So plan on 30 mins each way. Entrance as just US$9. In Terminal 2, when passing through customs, I just wrote Jim Jill Bang on the address portion of my arrival card (as I had a 3hr layover). I carry US citizenship/passport. Korean Air, and most other airlines fly into terminal 2. If you don't need/want the tub, Terminal 2 has a lot more to offer, including free showers and a resting area (just ask around).If you are a total chicken and afraid of riding the KTS to Seoul Station and spend time at a full-service spa, this is your best bet to get in a Jimjilbang experience. (I will say that I find it MUCH better to go to Siloam Spa just a few steps from Seoul Station. I can grab a meal in Meyongdong nearby and then head to the spa to get in some relaxation in a space that is not so fonfined as the Spa on Air.That said, this is a $20 USD entrance. No different than other Korean spas, you lock your shoes in a shoe locker, lock your stuff in a regular locker, and get your shower/soaks in. Once you are done, the common areas are fairly cramped and confined. Not much space compared to other spas but if you can get on a couch, you are good to go. I have a problem with Apocalyptic Snoring, and despite the language gap, I was able to get one of the massage rooms to sleep in for a few hours without being disturbed, which was GODSEND.Anyway, I get some people are just too gassed to go anywhere outside of the airport and for that, this spa is fantastic. As others have said you must EXIT the airside of the terminal and go through immigration. When they ask why all you have to say is JIM JILL BANG and you re good to go.All in all it was a nice place to stay, especially if you are waitng for an 8+ hour flight. Hot pools, showers, and a place to sleep or take a rest at. All though it was a tiny bit pricey overall it's a great place. It's kind of hard to find but just ask the receptionist and you're good to go.The initial receptionist was very accommodating as I explained I would have to return before starting session. Upon returning I selected the ""70"" full body oil massage with feel massage include. I must say I was completely impressed with the cleanness, ease of feeling, and no pressure at all that nothing was going to happen except was expected.The neck, legs, and feet were dream makers. I was able to fly out with comfort and feeling completely refreshed for my next flight.When I requested to wash my face, I was take over to a shower area, free, to do so, so clean you could eat off the floor.Price was very, very reasonable for services rendered.. I will be back. Thank you.MichaelI have been to both the spa in the basement of incheon airport and the transit lounge in terminal 1. The big difference for me is that the spa (which costs $7 usd is located outside security. So if you have a long layover and want to leave then that is where you would want to go. This area does include hot tubs and other services for more money. But it is communal (not a private shower<U+2014> many naked people all around you showering and freshening up). What I recommend much more to anyone is to use the transit lounge for long layovers. This lounge is only for those with long layovers and they will ask to see your ticket. But it’s right smack dab in the middle of terminal 1 on the upper floor. They have PRIVATE free showers (30 min time limit), a ”napzone” which includes a bunch of day beds in a darker lit room, a relax zone which was a bunch of people on their phones, and a “workzone” which as you can guess has a bunch of outlet and desk space. It’s so nice up there!! However, everyone I asked didn’t know where it was or that it existed. I did have to find this on my own. So the key is when you get off a flight with a long layover, don’t leave the airport. Instead follow the signs for transfer so you are still on the side passed security where the gates are. If you are super adventurous and want to spend your layover exploring, they do have free transit tours which means free tours to people who have long layovers. They leave the airport and they have a space to hold your bags or you can take them on the bus. The tour include places like shopping districts, temples, a cave tour, casino, etc. they are all at different times so if your layover is long enough you can go on more than one.This was the most painful massage I have ever had. Would not recommend it at all. It was not relaxing and the massage rooms are small divided walls with not top and they are next door to a loud game arcade area.Rest assured, they are definitely OPEN again. Nice new layout.(The old one was way better.)You take off your shoes, pay the amount, they give you the key and attire. Go to the locker room appropriate to your gender. Strip naked, store your belongings. Have a thorough shower before you get in the spas. After soaking, shower again, dry off and dress in attire handed to you after you paid. I don’t what happened to the saunas and steam rooms, maybe they’re in the common areas (which is extra).I went mid night. It was so busy. No space until 4am. Place is clean. Yes they do bath in Korean style which means naked. I won't say it's a good place to sleep. But it's a good place to clean up. It's smaller and price is higher than others in the city. But it's the airport. The water in the spa did get so hot and become impossible to get in. They also had a dry and wet spa. Not a hotel. It's a spa place you can rest in.I'd hoped to use the free lounge beds in the terminal but that's only for transit passengers. Since I booked a separate ticket out of Incheon I ended up at the Spa On Air.For $20 there's ample showers, several dipping pools and sleeping rooms - your choice of the communal rooms with mats and chairs or the sleeping rooms, mats only. You leave your shoes in a smaller locker before entering the changing room and accessing the larger locker for gear.Hard to beat value.I left my nice Seoul Airbnb since transportation shut down and I had to be at the airport for an early flight. I called this place beforehand to ensure there was room. I finally arrived after an hour of travelling to a sign outside saying it was completely full (with the amount of suitcases outside, I hope the interior was the size of a basketball gym to fit all of those people though I assume not). The receptionist told me I could wait until 4 am to get a spot (5 hours away). I had to pull teeth to get any recommendation of where I could stay that night and after taking a 20$ taxi to a nearby town, was surprised to find she had recommended a MASSAGE PARLOR (no overnight allowed). She knew full well I needed an overnight situation. I broke down in tears and the nice staff allowed me to stay the night on a massage bed after paying $40. There was no door. I slept a poor 4 hours before my taxi back in the morning (who knew so many Koreans get massages at 2 am?). Can't believe the staff was so unhelpful / (intentionally?) mean. At least it's a story..."
무의도,46건의<U+00A0>리뷰,인천 중구 무의동,25위(163곳의 인천 소재 관광지 중),"This was a really nice day trip from Seoul, with opportunity for some basic hiking or resting on the beach. It felt quite authentic too, with not too much influence from tourism, though the downside was that nobody spoke English. To get here, I took the free maglev train from Incheon airport to Yongyu, then crossed the road and took bus no 1, which crossed the road bridge onto the island. It stops at multiple points on the island and I took it right to the south part. There are some restaurants and coffee shops on the island, though do not expect them to speak English! Stopped off at Holly's coffee on the way back to enjoy a view of the island from the mainland. The island is free to get on.Honestly, I don't know what the other people saying ""must visit"" were thinking. Muuido Island is fundamentally not set up for foreign tourists. There is literally no information on the island to help find your way around and the sites are, well, bland. The restaurants don't speak English (and are far and few between anyway), the island bus is extremely crowded and uncomfortable, I found the whole experience to be entirely lacking. The best fun that I had was feeding the local stray cat with octopus jerky that I bought in desperation from the store. When I got back to Incheon Airport, I felt to relieved.To be fair: if you are a hiker or a trekker, by all means, follow the long paths and enjoy the scenery. If you have a car, great, by all means enjoy. If you're a casual tourist like me, trying to get out of the big city, this is not the right experience for you. If Muuido Island puts up some minimal information about what to expect or how to find your way around, that would make an immense difference. For everyone else, Avoid, Avoid, Avoid.Catch the 2-1 or 222 bus fromTerminal 1, 3rd floor, exit 7. 2-1 drops you before bridge, 222 after bridge (I took the 2-1 & just walked it from there as not too hot). Super busy at weekends, but very pleasant on a Monday. Best to stay at Hanagae or Silmi. Not much online to pre-book, but plenty here when you arrive. Restaurant menus nearly all in Korean - bring a translation book if you need help! Great food though, and plenty of little markets to stock up on snacks, beer and water. Campers, bring your tent! Perfect place to relax with friends. The bridge has been open for 3 months now, so it gets very busy with locals from Incheon at weekends. A lot of hikers come here (great trails starting from south end of Hanagae - don’t attempt in flip flops! There’s a bit of scrambling up to be done). There’s still quite a lot of construction going on around the island, and I imagine in a few months time, it’ll probably be geared up for foreign tourists (good or bad? Not sure)The no.1 bus will take you around the island - it comes around every 30 mins from all the key places. The tide does go out about a mile - so check before going if you’re making a short trip, as if out, you may be disappointed!Since the bridge between Incheon and Muuido Island was opened it is easy to visit. Bus one is running to all important places and must see spots on the Island. Just remember to take cash as the ATM does not take international cardsA little island which is near Incheon International Airport. Maybe, this island will be connected to the land by a bridge. A little trekking in Little Muyi Islet and near Hanagae Beach are recommended in this area. But Silmi Islet which is well known from a movie is not recommended. There are entry fees in entering Hanagae Beach and Simi Islet.I went here to explore what Hanagae Beach offers and actually to see a perfect sunset. It's a beautiful beach with a more than 90 ft. tall tower, huts you can rent, ATVs for rent, PFD rental place, a board walk that goes along the rock formations to the left of the beach, and some restaurants, a small market store, and nice trails to walk/jog/take pictures in. And did you all know, this island's claim to fame is the setting of a Korean drama show? lol I don't exactly know what the show is about but they have the house at Hanagae beach with pictures of the actors on the windows and the entrance. Praises for okiecb for putting really good info about Muuido Island! Another info I want to add is there is a bridge getting built. As of 23rd June 2018, it's about 80 percent complete. So to get to Muuido, you have to take the ferry to cross over from Jamjindo Island (mainland). Warning, 8 PM is the last ferry that crosses over from Muuido to Jamjindo, SO DON'T GET STUCK in the island like I did! lol! I had to pay 30,000 won for one night to rent a small hut. It has heated floor, two sliding window, a sliding door, a light, and 4 blankets and 4 pillows. I was lucky enough to meet some good folks there as well! These dudes offered me Korean BBQ, some Soju, whiskey and some Cass beer! Had a blast and a half!!!! Visit this island, get stuck if you want, but be ready to make some friends!! It's definitely worth your while! P.S. I didn't get to see the sunset because of clouds blocking the horizon lo! thank you Mother Nature!!What a wonderful place to visit in winter. Very easy access via the car ferry (24,000 Won return trip). Some wonderful beaches which at the time I visited were frozen into a winter wonderland.We spent 3 days camping on the beach and I have to say it was gorgeous! There are several activities to do at the place, asides from swimming in the ocean; there is a huge zip line that costs only 15 dollars per person, and I have to say, I am not acrophobic but it was REALLY high. You can pick seashells, I got some pretty impressive ones (and we even had a seashell showoff, I won). Moreover, there was a number of people who were catching clams while the tides were low, and in the end, finders keepers, they got to eat all the clams they found! How jealous... And lastly, there is a tiny stable with two horses, which you can take a nice horse ride along the shoreline and back. A memorable experience.We spend 24 hours at Muuido island at the Hanagae beach mid of September 2015. The island itself is cloth to incheon airport. You can approach the island only by ferry or swimming. The bridge construction started and probably finished after 2017. However the ferry boat can load around 40-50 cars. A car round trip cost you 29000 Won. The ticket needs to be purchased before entering the ferry. Ticket booth is close to the entry point. Probably you can reach that area also by bus. Waiting time at this Saturday morning was just 20 Minutes. The ride takes you 10 Minutes and don’t forget the special shrimp cracker to feed seagulls. Many people use this island for fishing and hiking. The island itself is not very big. Hanagae beach has parking facilities. We had booked a small cottage in advance. Additionally you have to pay entrance fee for the beach area. If I am not mistaken a 1000 Won per person. The cottage is equipped with small kitchen (incl.ref, micro wave, rice cooker, sink), ondol room 20 square meter, ondol bed stuff and small 00. Outside you have a small terrace with table, chairs and fire place for barbecue. You have also other choices which you can find at the web page. There are couple of restaurants serving fish mainly. They were not very busy at this time. No any 7/11 at the beach. We found one C&U at the ferry port. During day time there was low tide and few people came to look for mussels. At the beach you can rent a quad 15000 Won for 20 minutes but you cannot leave beach and you cannot go to sea side. Consequently was not our first choice. To be honest I did not see one people driving a quad. There is one tower (something like 15 meter high) were you can go down along a wire rope. Length around 400 meter. One ride 13000 Won. Equipment will be provided there. Most of the people had fun. Only one old lady was screaming like hell. LoL. Obviously Hanagae beach has been also used for some Korean soap drama. Finally it is a nice place for a group adventure were kids could have fun together and the oldies as well. No one was complaining about barbecue and campfire at the beach. We left Sunday early morning back to town and there was no much going on traffic wise. Between ferry and Hanagae beach we visited a new caffee shop which obviously just opened. Nice place with a nice terrace where you can look at all the planes coming in or going out. Coffee, Tea and waffle were good. It is definetly a place for stop over. They also offer camping and lodge. English was no problem at the coffee shop but at Hanagae beach. We may come back one day to Muuido.This small island is very close to the Incheon airport, there are 2 small beaches which you can enjoy swimming, some season you can collect sea shell at there, but the most great thing that I recommend you to do here is the TRACKING across the entire island, the total duration will be 3~4 hours as a round-trip by up & down several hills which heights are less than 200m. No entrance fee for the tracking but you need some money to use a ship which deliver you to the island from the main island(Airport area)"

It’s really picturesque. You get to it by walking through a lane of outdoor stalls featuring different things- especially unusual food. Then it’s through a lane of horoscope statues. You can pick out what sign you belong to. Be aware that getting to the temple involves many steep steps that were made for people with small feet and that there are many people to navigate through at the same time. That said, it is totally worth your time as the place is lovely and has several places to explore.It is relatively easy to get here from Haendae Beach. We took a 25min bus ride (Bus 100) from outside our hotel Novotel Ambassador Haeundae to the Fisheries building outside the temple. It was then a 10-15min walk from the main road to the temple. We did take a taxi back afterwards which costs us USD11. Outside the temple entrance there is a small food n souvenir market. Got my chance to try Hotteok pancake there n ‘ironed’ on grill dried squid! There are lots of steps going down to the shore area where the temple is located by the sea. I don’t recall seeing wheelchair access paths. The view of the temple from the shore is gorgeous and a great spot for photos. There were also people tossing coins into the wishing fountain area. Overall an interesting and picturesque place to spend 2-3hrs here. The Lotte Premium Outlets is just one bus stop before the Fisheries building stop so you can tie your visit with a visit there too. There are taxis from the temple to there if u prefer.This is a beautiful area to spend the morning or afternoon just walking around and taking pictures.  Very relaxing.A nice temple on a small hill. It was autumn and my toddler loved walking on the fallen leaves.

As for the 1 hour transit tour:
It's 20 minutes to and from the airport. You'll have 15-20 minutes to spend here. Recommended for short layovers.It's a small temple surrounded by trees on the top of a small hill.We went there at about 7:30am so it's very fresh, quiet and relax. We visited it in about 15 minutes.There is not much to see but still much better than stay at the airport waiting for next fly.Can't complain it's free and it is a small little temple near the airport. Worthwhile if you have a few hours to spare and Beats seating in a terminal waitingI had a 12 hr lay over in Incheon Airport and decided to take their free transit tour and it went Amazing! It's free and totally a wonderful experience. The temple was peaceful, very neat. Tour guides speak English well and are very friendly. I learned a lot in just few minutes. You can take Instagramable pictures but you have to be control your noise as the place is solemn. What amazed me the most is the tree that is over a thousand years old. It's a MUST- visit place.My family and I had a 5 hour layover at Incheon. We discovered the Korean Transit Tours (which are free and very in variety and length). Since we were limited on time we took the 1 hour tour to Yonggungsa Temple in Incheon. TIP: you should sign up in advance to get on these tours, can do so via web). The tour was easy to get find - they have kiosks throughout the airport. The tour company takes care of the bus and guide for you. They run right on time. The guide spoke terrific English. Since it was a bit of a drive there we only got to spend 15 minutes at the temple. But the guide did a great job and even my kids enjoyed it. It was a great escape from the airport. Highly recommended to look into this and other tours offered.This is a small temple near Incheon International Airport. We joined the Korean Free Transit Tour while waiting for our connecting fly. The temple consists of various buildings such as Gwaneumjeon (re-constructed by Heungseon Daewongun), Yosachae (home of the monks), Chilseonggak, and Yonghwanggak. In Yosachae, the writings of Heungseon Daewongun are hung on the wall and recently, an 11 meter-high statue of Maitreya was put in place. In front of the temple are two 1,300 year-old zelkova trees. It was the first tour to the temple in the early morning so it was very peaceful. It seemed to be a perfect time to visit this ancient temple, listen to its history, and enjoy a quiet morning.Cute little place in the hills with a solemn atmosphere. The monks were there and also a few people chanting. Very surreal. Wish there was more time but the tour allowed for only 10 minutes stay."

There was many facility for fun, but that was not for adult but children. If with children, there was very exciting place, I think. Funny theme park in the Wolmi island.on a weekday before dinner time, the place is literally a dead town. very minimal visitors are around, therefore you have the theme park generally to yourself. the rides generally look old, but the vikings struck me as the most fun - followed by the disco pang pang (which is more fun if you understand korean cos the dj will be interacting with you as he's the one controlling the ride). it gets busier as time goes, so yep. it's free to enter, but you have to pay KRW 5,000 to play a rideThe rides are fun especially the viking! Not recommended for young kids as the safety precaution facilities seems rather old and poorly maintain.A place with a lot of rides and huge scope of entertainment. Both for children and adults can enjoy the rides. A must visiting place for a family tour. There are a lot cafe with local market.Cheaper than Everland. But less fun for sure. For some short fun. Closes at 10pm, seeing the sunset here is fun.Varied activities, to wack-a-mole, very interesting sculptures abound. On the water side, live entertainers and typical carnival rides made for a family or DATE friendly atmosphere. Plenty of inexpensive places to eat as well. Very much worth the visit.it's a nice place just considering a place where to go to have a walk near the sea.of course appropriate for teenagers and family.I had been visited this place only for curiosity and because i had time!It's quite a very small theme park if we compare with other theme parks in Korea. Most of visitors are Korean teenagers and Korean family with small kids. Not too much rides to have fun.Just go if you have kids, this is for sure they will have fun!This place is just very nice next to the sea!You can find a lot of snacks, but also restaurants with extra fresh fishes and seafoodvisit only if you have a kid, they will love it, the nearby restaurants seems good, eat seafood there, I had one and it was SO GOOD and CHEAP, the theme park is actually nearby the seaside."
을왕리 해변,163건의<U+00A0>리뷰,인천 중구 을왕동,20위(163곳의 인천 소재 관광지 중),"1. The beach itself is poor. Do not go there after the low tide: the water is really muddy. Well, there is a shower, and it helps, but do you really want to swim in a muddy puddle like Peppa Pig?2. The infrastructure is great. Around the beach, there is a playground, a sports area, two bus stops (you can reach Incheon by bus!), several beach shops.Smaller in scale but a nice beach to visit. It's fairly clean and the water is a little dingy but there was a lot of young people swimming and playing in the beach. Parking in the beach is pretty accessible but not free. If you want to park close to the beach you have to be a customer of one of the restaurants there. The FREE parking lot is a little bit tucked away from the beach and a little bit of a walk. So wear comfortable shoes. Oh and I don't think there's showers there either.It was a satisfying beach day for us. We played and had plenty of sun and water. A few notes. Look at the tide charts and come at high tide as low tide has wire traps exposed. Also, some discuss the cleanliness if the Incheon coastal water. We did not fuss about that and had a fantastic day. Fun rocks and coves to climb on. Enjoy!Simple beach. Great for eating clams. Not too great for swimming - dirty. Advise going in season and having fresh clams.If i could give this a -20 I would. Do not believe those that are saying this is a nice spot. This is the most polluted beach I have ever seen. I have never seen a beach with brown water. There is small dead fish all over the place. I couldn't believe people were actually in the water and I couldn't believe people were letting their kids in that nasty water. The boardwalk area at 1st seems like a good place to shop. Do not, I repeat DO NOT, waste your time. The only thing they sell is things for the beach ie beach balls, etc. This old lady tried to charge me $30krw to rent an umbrella. The whole place is garbage. Do not waste your time on this place. It is disgusting.Although a small beach, it's a nice place to visit. Lot of crowd during the weekend. Lots of sea food restaurants.It's nice enough Beach to visit for the day. Full of expensive seafood restaurants. Also lots of nice coffee bars. A cappuccino costs 4,000, around ￡3.00. Visit for the day but don't stay overnight. We made the mistake of doing so. People come and camp out on the beach and then set off fireworks all night long. We stayed 2 nights. The first night, fireworks were going off till 0330. The second night, 0500. How can anyone sleep? We couldn't wait to leave.Many coffee shops surround beach. Follow cement path leading to popular fishing spot (also a small seafood & coffee shop there). If you're adventurous, head up (from the cement path) steep unmarked trails to a rocky outlook with excellent views of beaches in both directions.Very few good beaches around Seoul, if you do not go Busan, or Eastern side of the country. This beach is close to the airport, if you have time either before or after going into Seoul, this is one of the choice to walk on the beach. The sand quality is acceptable, there are many clams hidding under. Also many seagull will chase you for food. Sunset should be beautiful from the direction, but we're on the cloudy day. Many many seafood stalls there, if you parked opposite to their stall, the staff will come out and walk across theroad to greet you, if you just want to walk on the beach, they will ask you to park other place even there are many empty space. Finally, I parked on the beach side, again a man came to greet me and lead me to a stall. I understand if I don't eat something I can't park the car there and walk on the beach, so I ate something cheap, half kg of middle size prawn cost50000won, steamed, taste ok, but understand this is a touist price.After the meal, the man is very nice to help us taking photos, and suggested us to feed the seagull. It is really enjoyable.This beach is so lovely and enjoyable! It's crazy to think that Incheon is quite north (korea and worldwide speaking) but there is this south-asia alike beach with very warm water on summer!Just grab a bus from Songdo to reach this beach in about 1h30"

It is about 45 minutes drive from Incheon International Airport (meter-taxi will charge about USD 30 each way), and you will need at least an hour and a half to visit this absolutely gorgeous and well organized fish market complex, buy some fresh seafood at a stall and have it cooke at one of the restaurants within the complex. Few vendors speak English. make sure you agree on the price as seafood in South Korea can get extremely expensive. Well worth a visit.We did hundred of pictures, big choice of fish and fish products. Smell is very strong, be prepared for it.For a seafood market was surprised at the cleanliness of the stalls and surrounds. It has so many stalls selling various products both fresh and smoked and various other methods I've not seen before. A wonderful display to look at as you wander around the place. Was interested in the cooking and eating on the spot but didn't sample as I was unsure of the productWe had only one night at Incheon and the hotel staff suggested to go down to the fish market for a walk and some dinner!What a treat! This is the real deal! All live fresh fish , hundreds of stalls of it and many places where they just cook it for you to order ...from the water to the table ...simply unique!Not to be missed if you like seafood!If you are looking for a place to be for fresh fish go here .open every day . There are many different types of fish and crustaceans to choose from . But I think if you want to eat there just be aware that our clean standards are much higher than what you will see there. I bought fried shrimp and squid from a stall and later watched them drop a couple of pieces on the ground and put them on a tray so that they could be sold later . Imagine all the water and dirt. All in all if you want to see a fish market and you have time drop by.This is a huge complex with hundreds of stalls selling all sorts of seafood, fresh and dried.The place is very clean for a seafood market as there are workers working tirelessly clearing and cleaning the walkway.We were amazed with the varieties of local seafood from octopus, stingrays, shell fishes, monk fish, flatheads to giant groupers. Fish can be purchased, cut and eaten on the spot.Interesting place to visit."

Hwaeomsa temple has beautiful grounds and temple structures. It's a well kept and educational glimpse into Korean culture. Highly recommended if you are in the area with an hour to spare.As part of our trip to Jirisan, and exploration of the Piagol valley later, this was a great way to spend the afternoon. It is certainly one of the best temples we have visited in Korea as the wooden structures gave it a real earthly feel, very calming and I guess basic in some ways. Many other temples often have bright colours but this one retains the original bare wood. The whole atmosphere is sublime and as we went in autumn the colours were wonderful as the setting is surrounded by wooded mountains.Hwaeomsa Temple is one of the best in Korea. The location is exquisite, nestled in a beautiful valley in Jirisan National Park. The historic pagodas are from the Silla dynasty. Much of the wooden buildings we see today date back to the restoration of the temple between 1699-1702. The temple is littered with National Treasures, including the largest stone lantern on the Korean Peninsula. During my visit in early June, the mountain was a vivid green and the air was fresh. Hwaeomsa in my view is a hidden gem, much along the same lines as Beopjusa Temple. Too often I hear how Korean temples are all the same. You will eat your words if you visit Hwaeomsa, Beopjusa, Haeinsa, Unjusa, Tongdosa, and Bulguksa. These six temples are exceptional and are a testament to the traditions of Korean Buddhism.I visited the Hwaeomsa temple over the Buddha's birthday holiday and was wowed by the location. In late spring, the mountains are lush and bright green with foliage, and the temple itself is beautiful. It's a long way from Seoul, anywhere from 4-6 hours by bus depending on traffic, but well worth it. The Jirisan mountain area is stunning and the air quality much better than the big city.If you're brave you can opt for the temple stay option, experiencing the ascetic lifestyle of Buddhist monks. As temples go, this one is actually rather well-appointed, with electricity and hot showers. You will need to get comfortable with sleeping on the floor and eating three meals a day of vegetarian bibimbap, though. Waking up at 3AM to watch the Buddhist monks pray is a disorienting but unique experience.Otherwise, just go for the view and the relaxing hiking opportunities in the area. You won't be disappointed."

Would definitely recommend this! My littler kids enjoyed the playground while older ones enjoyed the scenery and art most!A beautiful bamboo forest with Korean traditional buildings. There were some special events (e.g., tea ceremony) and activity zones when I visited. I'll say it's a family friendly place but it will be still excellent to couples or friends. It's calming atmosphere will definitely help you ease your stress. It will take 2-3 hours if you walk slowly, taking some photos at times.The right place to visit if you seek for tranquility and just release stress! Many people come here for sort of mental healing, the place is huge with many paths to take in the forest, and some museum and cafe (spare at least 1 hour to explore). It's also a popular place for couples to visit since it's a really calm and romantic atmosphere. This place is worth visit ANYTIME, because in all 4 seasons, the color of the bamboo won't change (always green). However, check the weather before coming there. Although it's also beautiful in the rain, if you come there to take pics of yourself, it's much better when it's sunny.A beautiful day at the Damyang Bamboo forest! While strolling down the bamboo forest, I felt so at peace and relaxed! It’s a perfect getaway from a busy city life Also, you can take great photos as it’s green all year around! Totally recommend it <U+2705> P. S: make sure to try their Bamboo ice cream! It’s SO YUMMY!!I went to stay with my daughters in South Korea for two weeks and this is what we did on our last day together. We held hands and strolled through the beautiful bamboo-lined paths, shopped in some of the lovely shops, drank bamboo tea, ate bamboo ice cream, and one of my daughters and I even split a bamboo beer. It’s a lovely place. Feels so good to be surrounded by greenery, so calming. My daughters are adults but it didn’t give me the option ha haThis is basically a tourist trap. Someone planted a bunch of bamboo to make a mini-forest and make a pseudo-attraction. This is not a historical site and has no real significance. That said, it is still a pleasant walk and where else can you get and eat bamboo ice cream (which tastes suspiciously like green tea ice cream)?Just stroll around in here under the bamboo shade in a state of ignorance to busy city life. You can see lots of families or lovers walking along bamboo forest trails. Try bamboo sprout ice cream.Had never seen a bamboo forest so it was nice. We walk through the whole park maybe in about 1 hour or a bit more. There's a cafe quite near the entrance where we had really nice ice cream. At the other end of the park there was another cafe and we had bamboo leaf tea, which was surprisingly nice. We went in march and it wasn't crowded at all, we had a very nice time. I expect in the summer it must be a very busy area with lot's of activities just outside the park. We parked easily and for free but maybe that's due to the time of year, i think there is a bigger car park for the Bamboo forest around the back entrance.The effort to make this place a tourist attraction is marvellous using bamboo plantation.I did not make it to the other gate as it was quite a distance with the uneven steps.Basically, it is quite the same view walking through the park with bamboos surrounding you."

You need to pay ($2-3, can't remember exactly) to get into the main road, which is about 1 mile. Walking through the main road is a refreshing experience. You will also find some great photo spots. No vehicles are allowed in the paid area. I went to Gwanbangjerim first and lent a bicycle to the Metasequoia road and it took about 10-15 minutres. I think you can directly get there too.This road is lined with big metasequoia trees. The lenghth of this road is around 5km. It is not free to stroll along the road. Our feelings are a little hurt to pay to stroll along this road. This place is very good for forest-bathing. You should pay 2,000 Korean Won to get in. But it is free after 18:00. You can see lots of people, especially lovers, to come here. There are shops, cafes, and restaurants at the entrance. It is good to take pictures around here.This is a one of the most famous place in Damyang. You can feel the fresh environment with everyoneWalked along Gwangbang Jae Lim and the views are awsome. At the end of Gwangbang Jae Lim will reach the Metasequoia-Lined Road. Can see the trees from the outside. Not worth paying 3000won to enter the road when Gwangbang Jae Lim is more impressive and it's free.I went here early in the morning before it was busy--which meant the road was quiet and peaceful. This is certainly a beautiful road for the purpose of enjoying nature.The shaded road makes a pleasant shaded walk in the summer. There is another avenue closer to the bamboo gardens which is more accessibleA very picturesque stretch of pedestrianized road lined with metasequoia trees. There are some quirky statues and features along the way which add interest. The road is not particularly long, perhaps a 10-15 minute walk. There was an entrance fee but it was minimal and the road is flat and suitable for pushchairs & wheelchairs.There is a strawberry farm at one end which sold the most sweetest, juiciest strawberries I've had. Well worth a visit!Was visiting Damyang to check Juknokwon bamboo garden and getting Metasiquoia trees road was a good bonus for my trip. Nothing more except for photographers or instagrammers - it will definitely add some likes to your account. There are some good cafes in the area as well. Worth visiting only if you are passing by this area.The Metasequoia Road is simply a walking path lined with trees, however, it is a beautiful place to take a stroll. It is pet-friendly as long as your dog is on a leash. It cost 2,000w per person to get in as well. The trees were still green but I imagine it's even more beautiful once fall is in full-swing and the leaves change color.A beautiful place with fresh air. Also good for couples to visit or even have a picnik. Pictures are also turning out great. But I reccoment only if you like nature."

국립 해양 문화재 연구소 해양 박물관,30건의<U+00A0>리뷰,전라남도 목포 남농로 136,3위(17곳의 목포 소재 관광지 중),"For its size, Mokpo has a lot to offer. This museum was excellent. There were a few attractions outside and 4 exhibition halls inside. Huge bonus: admission was free. It was well set up. The first exhibition hall started with 2 major excavated ships, their remains and retrieved cargo, then moved into the main historical recovery. I believe it was the Sinan ship and cargo. It was beautiful and well designed. Arrows on the floor helped you know which way to go, and most of the descriptions were also in English. Enough so that it was interesting to read the history. Then the 3rd and 4th exhibition halls included the ancient history of maritime in Korea and then modern age maritime history in and around Korea. Well laid out. They also have a neat little souvenir shop with some knick knacks and a play area for kids.After a misunderstanding with directions and our taxi driver (significantly our errors) we made it to the museum. It was quite simply brilliant and catered fully to my full dependence on English as my only language. Logical layout and terrific graphics and mixed media to support interpretation and maintain high degree of engagement. Would highly recommend.I loved visiting the museum and was very impressed with the exhibits the little gift shop had beautiful souvenirs to remember the visit. Again as a foreigner even getting coffee can be a problem when you not sure what you asking forI thought this might be a rather worthy place but actually it was completely riveting. The recovered 14th century shipwreck is superbly displayed and evokes a period when trade between China, Korea and Japan was flourishing, with whole stacks of completely unblemished bowls preserved down the centuries. The photos of the recovery effort in the 1970s and 1980s give a sense of how exciting it must have been to bring up from the deep so many artefacts untouched for centuries.Free. Yes this great local museum is free. The amount of rose wood in the ship wrack was amazing. All the 15th century Korean Chinese and Japanese ceramics are amazing. The tons and tons and tons of Rosewood is what amazed me.This is a first of a kind I visited in Korea. The museum and it's exhi bition is dedicated on a discovery of a 500 years old shunken ferry. It let us see the old trade items and route. It was quite educational for our family.This museum is well organized and staffs are very kind. Audio guide is available and it exhibits the historical relics/artifacts found in sunken vessel from Mokpo port. It reveals that this port was an important spot of overseas trading between Korea, China and Japan from 12th century to 17th century. There are exhibits for kids as well.A very nice and organized museum.
Visitor can see nay shipwrecks and recovery items and can learn the maritime history of Korea throw them. 
It worth to visit specially with your children.Very nice museum to walk around. Doesn't take much time to finish. The entrance is free. When I was there, there were no audio guides in English. There are 5-6 rooms with an own theme. The showpiece was a chinese ship that has sunk in the korean waters 600 years ago.It is the place where archeologists restore Korean ancient and middle-aged ships after finding wrecked ones in Yellow sea. You can see not only the ships but various relics found in them. For children, it's fairly nice place."

Its a quick easy walk around a boardwalk on the water to get to them. The plaques explain the stories and history of the rocks. They have it in multiple languages, including English, Chinese and Japanese. Great for photos and doesn't take long. For better views, follow a trail to the top of the cliff overhead for views of the water and surrounding area. Be sure to wear good shoes if you do this. For just the boardwalk, footwear isn't as critical. But you do want a camera.An interesting rock formation by the seashore. Erosion over centuries has carved out 2 figure heads which appears as if they are wearing old style Korean hat. To find out what the story is you will have to visit !My son visited the site before and I looked forward to seeing it and I was not disappointed it really is special to see and read the history I lived visiting and would highly recommend itThe rocks are only 100 meters from the main road .There is a large sign marking the spot and a loop walk of 5 minutes will get you to the site.There is a explanation board there and an easy photo.Worth the effort.They are probably nice and sweety (the meaning at least) but I couldn’t see them due to work reason, they are under costruction or sometjing... i climbed the rock on top and reached them from top..the view btw is spectacular of the whole bay...it was also foggy day and looked like Pirate’s IslandWe took an evening stroll along the waterfront area straddling from two major attractions, the water fountains and the Gatbawi Rock, in Mokpo, South Korea. There are lots of locals walking briskly or slowly like us. The lifestyle is relaxed in contrast to the big cities.its walking line is connected to the new sightseeing site, Peace square. I think this place is one of the best playing places in Mokpo.The rock formation is very unusual and uniquely shaped. The city has built a deck in front of it to see and walk around. The sea itself is very beautiful and the hill above it offers a pleasant walk and nice view. There are other attractions nearby. You don't need to make a separate trip just for it.It's quite a nice walk and i think very enjoyable during the spring or when the weather is nice. the walk is fairly short and there isn't much reason to linger by the rocks but its verypleasant and the rocks have a nice story. It's nice to visit if you're in the area and want to enjoy a day at the park of have a short hike afterwards.Nice how weather could shape these rocks in what they are now. From the walkway you can admire these two and at night they're illuminated (luckily not as excessively as the walkway)"

Stroll through the tiered walkways of sculptures and ponder each as you go. Some are very unique and interesting. Most have an English translation. There is an arboretum of small bonsai and some flower beds nearby as well. If you continue to climb, you will also pass a Buddhist Temple and eventually reach the top of Yudalsan overlooking the Mokpo bridge, although we didn't go that far this day. Be ready for lots of walking/hiking if you do go all the way up.Nothing really spectacular.While you are walking though the mountain area this is at the  far end of the park.Various sculptures of different things..Pleasant place to visit but hte sculptures were not exceptional.Nice place to stop & rest either on the walk up or down from the YudalsanThis park is a jewel.

Each piece is unique and beautiful, the park is clean and very well kept and there is even a temple at the top of the mountain.There was nothing really outstanding about this place, but I was a nice place to stroll around.  If you have some free time in Mokpo I would check this place out, but I wound not go out of my way to see it.Just up the hill from the train station and downtown Mokpo is Yudalsan - Yudal Mountain. As you climb the mountain you enjoy sculptures with plaques telling the history, 2 canons (My understanding is one still is shot off but I didn't experience that), beautiful pagodas to sit and rest and enjoy the view (both of the city and the surrounding seaport), and the peaceful feeling of being in nature, even when you are mere moments from the busyness of the city. Pack a picnic lunch and make your way up the mountain to enjoy the beauty of South Korea!Don't let the 'International' in the name fool you, - only six of the park's dozens of sculptures are from non-Koreans. Originally opened in November 1982, this was the first outdoor park for sculptures in Korea. The 48,000 square-meter park originally displayed sculptures leased from the Korea Sculpture Park Society. When the lease expired, however, the sculptures were removed. In August 2008, the park reopened with a new set of sculptures representing the theme Nature, Culture, and Sculpture. It's a nice variety of art, from completely abstract to some with a more understandable meaning."

I think a day is just sufficient to walk the whole park. Closed at 7pm thou and not open at nightSuncheon Bay Garden is a vast garden that is almost like a theme park containing gardens with variety of themes (mostly other countries) along with a couple of rides (mainly to easily cover the distance of the vast park), theater, and some flamingos. While the admission might seem bit high for a garden it will take a good three hours to walk around and see everything. In early May, it was already getting too hot so it’s probably not that pleasant for about half of the year. Most of the park is very scenic and is covered with colorful flowers with hundreds of photogenic spots. The Suncheon Lake area with the small hills were especially scenic. Most of the country-themed gardens were tacky though. For example, the Netherlands garden had a windmill, Thai garden had an elephant, Mexican garden had some ceramic cacti, and the German garden had a Volkswagon Beetle. Despite those, the Korean garden and the field of rapeseed flowers along with the lake were picturesque and worth the price of admission.Fabulous gardens in stunning condition and with art, culture, history and performance for everyone's taste.It is really nice, I would recommend a visit. There is a section for each country, some of the sections are a bit disappointing, but if you're going for the general experience then it's great. Spring is the best time to go.This is my third time visiting Suncheon Bay Garden and I still love it. This place is really big so be prepared to spend about 3-4 hours exploring this garden. If you like photography, this would be a great place to take some shots of the beautiful scenery. If you are a nature lover, you will definitely love this place. Highly recommend you to come here during Autumn.Here is the world of colorful flowers and trees so yoy can not only see the beautiful view here but also tale picture with many special and impressive concepts on the hill with friends or family.

We rode our free hotel bikes on the first day and left them at the West Gate. We bought a 2 day pass for the 6 local attractions but used it for two entries into the gardens/ wetlands (which I don’t think is meant to happen but we did!) We then took the monorail (sky cube 8000pp return) to the wetlands to catch the last boat trip (7000pp buy tickets at the wharf only) at 16:40 - check times as the timetable depends on the tide). We caught sight of the Observatory across the famous reed beds which we planned to climb to the following day. We were advised that the last monorail back was 5.30pm but we saw them running after that and even up to 6pm on Saturday evening as we were cycling back along the river in the dark! It’s definitely worth a trip and it was busy but not too bad even at the weekend in November and the weather was absolutely stunning.

Trainers are ok and don’t forget to use the compressed air blowers to clean the dust off your footwear after the trek to the observatory!I appreciate the work of those who built the boardwalk for visitors to be very close to nature surrounded by reeds. From the entrance to the top observatory, it is about 2.5km walk. Beautiful scenery.There is a low observatory inside the park where you can view the wetland at a height. The path to the end of the wetland is walking along a long wooden bridge with long grass beside. I cannot see any wild live living in the wetland as they are covered by long grass. Maybe the koreans should trim the grass so that more wild live can be seen. Overall the scenary there is good.We were here back in August and despite the burning sun we had a wonderful and relaxing time. The area is big and peaceful, and lots of areas with shadow that can cool you off. At the top of the Observatorium we had a great view and we were lucky because a guide approach us and gave us some information regarding the bay. We didn't saw as much birds as I expected but it wasn't the season for this. At the end we stoped at the local restaurant and we drank magnolia tea and eat a delicious desert. It's a must see in this area and it gives you a pozitive energy.is a hooded crane reserve but not the time of year for them migrating. But lovely watching over the wetlandsI visited here on March. They mentiioned November is best time to visit. Plan to visit again in NovemberThis parkland is serenely beautiful and teeming with wildlife of all descriptions. Excellent cafe and visitor centre. Great for everyone and very accessible.Went there right at the hottest summer. To see the sunset, bc of the dusty weather, couldn’t see anything. But it worth to go .Suncheon Bay is lovely, it's also very different depending on the season. I would be careful about going in summer, it's very hot and there isn't tons of shade. Spring is beautiful and there is a lovely walk up to the viewpoint.A peaceful place to take a walk and enjoy nature. Suncheon Bay Reeds Festival happens every october and the view here is spectacular. Spend about 1-2 hours walking and enjoying the view."

여수 수산시장,41건의<U+00A0>리뷰,전라남도 여수 교동 680,7위(35곳의 여수 소재 관광지 중),"We came here. It’s a pretty typical Korean fish market. Lots of fish. Also other things (fruits, vegetables, meat, nuts, textiles, etc). Nothing special. Nothing wrong with it. We tried to go to a nearby eel place - but they were grilling with charcoal in an enclosed space with no ventilation. Amazing!We went to the fish market, picked a fresh fresh, and had it sashimi-ed. All of the vendors pretty much charge the same price and no room for haggle. For one flat fish, we paid about $30 CAD. They give you the sashimi and all the left overs for making soup, which either they take it up for you or you take it with you to the restaurant number they give you. The cost to have the soup cooked for you plus the set-up fee is about $15 for two people. All in-all, it was a pretty cool Korean experience. The restaurant we ended up at wasn't as friendly, but the lady who prepared the sashimi was awesome. The people are known to be a rough in the fish market - be aware.Dropped by the market to see some fresh fish and seafood. Numerous vendors selling all kinds of fishes. Decided to order some raw fish from a vendor. They prepare your fish right at the spot then you can take the prepared raw fish upstairs where you will find tables to eat them. It does not get any more fresh than this.We arrived pretty early in the morning. Markets are my idea of fun--wandering through interesting booths and all. The morning auction began and that was a complete fun time. We got to watch merchants signal their bids for the fish. It was great!Fish sales people are amazingly friendly, and want you to try their products. Oxtopus legs, still squirming. How many varieties of fish are there?? Take your time for an hour or two!We were taken to Yeosu fish market by our Korean friends so it is hard to give an accurate review of the experience as English tourists on our own. First impressions were completely alien-everything is still alive and swimming around (many of the beasties we'd never seen before) Once we'd made a decision as to what we wanted to try, they were fished out of their tanks and killed right in front of you with incredible speed and accuracy. We then took what we'd bought to one of the many restaurants above the market, where the idea is that you inform the kitchen staff how you want each thing prepared. Luckily we had Koreans with us who knew what they were doing because otherwise we wouldn't have had a clue. While we waited we were sat around a traditional low table (one of the reasons the rating dropped a star was that as westerners we found it really uncomfortable to sit on the floor for so long) and served the ubiquitous kimchee and plums. They brought each course out as it was ready, starting with scallops, clams and raw fish which you wrap yourself in lettuce and sesame leaves with the traditional chilli sauce. Next came huge tiger prawns, fried Hake (millions of bones beware...but there is a magnificent trick of how to expertly remove them with chopsticks if you can find someone to show you how) To finish off we were served a really spicy soup made from all the pieces of fish left over after preparation (including tails,fins,heads,eyeballs) We found it delicious, despite not being the biggest seafood fans. This was all washed down with gallons of 'Somak' - a glass of beer mixed with Soju, very tasty. The waitresses were very hospitable and attentive without being smothering, and the locals enjoyed seeing foreign faces (as usual!)"

Our plan focused around the events held at the nearby tea fields, but we added the cable car to the end of our trip. The views from the cable car were great and I would recommend the cable car with a glass base. The park found at one end of the ride was very pretty and had wonderful views of the local scenery. There is a coffee shop with a fun, romantic activity. You can purchase heart-shaped, wooden cut-outs for 5,000 Won and write any message you want. You can then keep the cut-out as a memento or place it on one of the fence posts surrounding the shop. As far as I could tell, there were hundreds of cut-outs hanging from the fence. While the cable car is not enough of a reason to visit Yeosu, it would be a pleasant addition if you plan to visit the area.nice to ride, but cost you about $15 round trip, with option for clear bottom view car for additional fee.The cable car is definitely worth trying. Unless you are afraid of heights, be sure to choose the ""crystal car"", which is a car with a glass floor. It costs 22000 won per person for a round trip (the standard car costs 18000 won) but it would not be the same experience without the glass floor. The view of Yeosu from above, however, might be a bit underwhelming. Still, worth checking out.I loved this! Althought the lines were long, it was definitely worth going on. If I remember correctly, you can either take the elevator, or go up a looong set of stairs. It was the dead of summer time, so we took the elevator, which made the wait even longer, but it made it that much more worth it. The view of the water and the city and everything was amazing. I have so many pictures to share, but they are on my Korean cellphone. If you come to Yeosu (and you should!) definitely come here!Ok so this was really fun! The lines were long, but the views were amazing!. I was nervous at first, but that went away. Fun thing to do to see the beautiful water!.It’s a long wait. But you can get a good view of Yeosu/Dolsando (bits, anyway). There’s not a whole lot to do in Yeosu so why not??But between railbike and cable car, I recommend railbike first!The site is closed for repairs. it looks like a worthwhile trip but check it is open first. The taxi driver dropped us off at the site and it is a long walk to the turtle ship that was also closed for repair and the ferries had reduced service.It was a nice and relaxing bus trip from Mokpo to Yeosu. After settled in the hotel haven, we called a cab to the cable car. The areas around the cable car has lots of path to walk around. We see mostly Koreans rather than foreigners. The night market has good food as well.Nice view at night, comfortable. I will go again this summer when I go to Yeosu. I recommend to all people.Normally when you take a cable car you expect to have a nice view but here nothing special. It doest not take much time to cross the sea. The view downstairs and in front is quite ordinary."

Unique is the pair of belugas that were active and responding to the crowd at feeding times. Also has lots of smaller tanks with a variety species. Nice to visit for an hour or so.It was a 15 minute drive from hotel in Yeosu to the Expo compound. Taxi cost about 13000Won or US$15. Situated within is the Aqua Planet. During the day not many visitors sighted but fills up in the evening. Educational tour so worth a visit by school students. It’s also fun for the grown ups. We also enjoyed the tour. Many activities inside. Check out the Marine life. Aqua forest theme. Ocean theme. 3D museum. 5D theatre etc. cost for the package was 34000 won each or approximately US$35. Many cafe and restaurants inside with a good view of the Big-O. Huge complex. Lot of parking. Lot of walking to do. So do wear good comfortable walking shoes and enjoy.This is my first time to go aqua plate like this but it has strong impression on me after all.This is very beautifull and nice place.It is very suitable for your children for not only let them feel happy but although bring new knowledge and enthusiasm for them.I hope you guy have the same experience.Best,Not too big of an aquarium but has plenty of things on display and a good way to spend a couple hours.I had a fun day at Aqua Planet with looking at the different species. There are shows available throughout the day but they are not available in English but you can guess some of the content of the show.The gift shop is a little pricy but that's what a tourist place is.I love nature and so zoos, sanctuaries and aquariums are some favorite places. This is the best one I've been to - a wide variety of underwater life, displayed to great effect.The layout - a central rotunda with themed exhibits opening off it, allows you to structure your visit. The information brochure is very detailed and a great guide to seeing what you'd like to see.The beluga show was amazing.I must say I'm not really that much into sculptures being used to create an atmosphere, such as in the riverine exhibit, but all in all this was a very worthwhilte visit, especially as it was raining heavily and the rest of the Expo site was not accesible in such weather.The place is located within the Yeosu World Expo area and is one of the bigger attractions around this area, if not the biggest.Prices have reduced since a few years when I first visited, and the beluga whales are back!... although the aquarium seems way too small for them to feel at home.The ""alive museum"" area was a novelty, and would only recommend if you get it as a bargain grouped sale and not as a standalone ticket.It's great that I got to see a pair of Beluga for the first time! Had a great time with my family :)The build and construction is quite unique , with pathways literally going through the big chamber aquarium.  Then the show they gave at the end was quite impressive too :) i enjoyed it, worth checking out.It's good but not excellent. Belugas(white whales) were attractive and cute. It's interesting to see baby shark flipping in the yolk sac. The others are the average."
오동도,242건의<U+00A0>리뷰,전라남도 여수 한려동 1,3위(35곳의 여수 소재 관광지 중),"Cute little island to visit if you have some time to spend in Yeosu. There are some paths bringing you to the cliffs on the island, we had a good time there in October, it was sunny and not cold at all. It felt nice to be out of the city and to just watch the boats passing by. I recommend for a relaxing afternoon, 1-2 hours trip.offers nice view and walking trail. I would recommend a trolley ride for $1 to minimize the walk. Easier for rest of tripThe island is tiny and has some very nice views on the sea and the Yeosu port but it is unimpressive. Apparently it is beautiful in the blooming season but we were there at the end of May and there was not much to see. Right now (May/June 2019) the famous lighthouse is under renovation and inaccessible to tourists.If you're in Yeosu and looking for an easy walk/hike, this is it. Its a bit of a trek along the wall to get to the island, but it's well set up. The path is marked and has stairs. Lots of stairs, in some places. But overall an easy walk/hike. Doesn't take long, wouldn't need anything special, though I wouldn't recommend any formal wear, esp footwear. But regular shoes are just fine. It doesn't take long and has some very beautiful scenic spots. Wonderful if you like nature.I loved this place! My brother and I came here in the middle of summer, so we were so sweaty and hot. But the walk to Odongdo was worth it. We could have took a bus instead of walking the road, but we chose to walk there and bus back. There were so many trees and rocks (can't think of the right words to describe it exactly) but it was amazing. There is a specific tree that you will see while there as well... Definitely a place to visit!Odongdo was recommended to me by my local friends. I caught the bus from the terminal in Gwangju and the ride was nice. Once you get to the small bus station in Yeosu, you’ll need to either walk (very far) or taxi to the pier. From the pier you will see the different bridges that connect the area. The actual hike/walk throughout the island was really nice. Crowds weren’t large and there were seafood restaurants everywhere. There is an aquarium, cable car rides (lines are very long midday and walk up to cars without a car is long) and more. Perfect day trip. The beach was beautiful. I took a cab and he was so friendly. I met more people and ate more local seafood while watching the boats before sunset. There are many small parts that make the whole of Odongdo, so stop by the tourism center, get your map and enjoy your time. If you don’t have time to visit Jeju, this is a nice alternative.We decided to go for a walk in the afternoon. You can take the shuttle to cross the breakwater but if you want to walk & enjoy the scenery, I suggest to just walk. We walked back and forth.When we reached the island, we sat in one of the benches while we had some iced coffee (we bought it in the store within the island). We listened to the water fountain show.After that, we climb the hill to see the dragon cave, etc. It was windy and a relaxing walk. When you go back, you can can use the elevator up to the 11th floor where you can see the Yeosu Sea. There coffee shops and snack counters. Highly recommended.We visited this place during the evening, and caught the last few minutes of the fountain show. We had originally planned to bike here, but without a Korea phone number, we found it very difficult to rent the bike available at the Expo center. Also, Information Center in Yeosu Train station knew nothing about the bike rental locations other than the ones they had there. In the evening, the place was still lit up nicely and the path was easy to follow. The music around the path was creepy, however. We spent about 2 hours walking to and back.When I arrived Yeosu expo station this is one of so many nearby plate I had already come.This small Island has goods sea sight at the top house (white house) of the Island.There are alot of point plate on that Island.You better walk than travel by electrical bus, I think this trip can also improve your healthy when you climb to all of this Island making places.Hope you have a good trip.Bestsmall a beautiful island just like a forest that you can take rest for hours and listen to ocean wave sound ~"

One participates in the typical rituals of the monastery, including prayers and meals. There’s also a tea ceremony with a monk. We were lucky enough to be there for the first snow of the year, which happened to be super heavy. The monks put me to work (working meditation) sweeping and shoveling snow. It’s a really beautiful place. As the photos and other reviews make clear. There’s also a hike to the top of the mountain (one can see Jindo and Wando from there, I guess). But I was advised not to because of the snow. The food is excellent. It’s all vegan. A lot of different flavors. I think they served us a local curry type, that they specialize in. There is English support there (thanks Chajae!), so those who don’t speak Korean need not shy away.It's time to be silent and watch this temple for a certain amount of time without doing anything. In doing so, we can feel this temple more deeply. Then we can realize there is no temple and even there is no me. That's when we are getting out of ourselves in our boundary.I completed 7 nights and 8 days silent meditation called ""Chamsaramui Hyanggi"", roughly translated into English as ""Scent of your True Being"". Mihwangsa Temple is one of the most beautiful and serene places I have ever been to. The staff are very kind and gentle, the head monk was very wise and one can see that he's enlightened, the food was delicious and healthy. The meditation sessions were strenuous; however, one is taught how to properly eat a meal and conduct a tea ceremony as well. It's a must for a person/family if you are interested in a Korean Buddhist Temple stay.It was one of those trips that I needed to get away from the real world and be with myself and listen to my body and my mind. I heard of the temple from Mom and she said it's close to southern most tip of Korea an it will be very beautiful.Getting to this place is not the easiest, however it was worth every second of the bus ride. Local cab driver was very nice.We got there and staff helped us to the rooms and it was very nice. (You will be sleeping on the floor on top of a thick cotton ""mattress""- it's actually super comfortable). Remember you are at a temple not at Ritz. You are also given a temple clothes to wear for the duration of the stay and it was nice to wake up each morning and not think about what you needed to wear.First evening we had a dinner that was super delicious, joined a prayer that was so calming, and had a tea ceremony with the monks. The evening ended with full moon stroll to wrap up the day. It was a good way to settle in.Next day, we were woken up by ""mok-tak,"" a wooden gong before the sun was up. We took silent stroll and joined another AM prayer. Our group got to hit the bell that was in the courtyard. Watching the sun come up was amazing.I can go on about the experience- we got there in may right before Buddah's birthday celebration and it was GREAT! Made lanterns to decorate the place!Overall,I didn't want to leave, it was so nice to just be and not worry about anything but to just be with the nature. I felt like my soul was healed from the city life and the rat race.I would go back in a heart beat and next time stay a little longer. Food was amazing and the hospitality really made you feel the love they teach about.P.s I also went to 4-5 other temples on this trip and it felt more like a business and they have lost the true teachings of Buddhism. But this old gem was true to the teachings and everyone there was amazing!Our family of 2 adults and 3 teenagers stayed at this amazing temple in October. Just getting to the temple was a wonderful adventure. Learning to bow properly, having meals together and taking tea with the head monk were some highlights. We also hiked up to the top of the mountain-not easy but we were rewarded by the beautiful view. Even the views from the temple complex were spectacular. We were shown to our sleeping quarters-historical and private and given simple, comfortable clothing to wear for our stay. Peaceful and interesting experience that we will never forget. Can't wait to return!I visited Mihwangsa temple for the day and had a temple lunch at the shop there.This is a beautiful temple. Very very peaceful.When we arrived we met a lady who was waiting for some guests for a temple stay and she gave us a small tour of the temple.The lunch at the shop was delicious: rice wrapped in lotus leaf, a soup and salad and vegetables from the garden. We only stayed a couple of hours but I would consider returning to this temple for a temple stay. Such a relaxing place surrounded by beautiful mountains.I did a templestay here and I loved it. The location is beautiful and peaceful, the people are incredibly nice and there is no pressure to go to all the rituals (and also lots of free time to relax). I was also lucky to be able to go there during the Gwaebul ceremony, which happens every year.My entire trip around Korea, including my templestay at Mihwangsa, is described here: http://ttlgawift.weebly.com/around-korea-in-15-days.html .I just finished my temple stay at Mihwangsa. I must say it's one of the best experiences I've had while traveling. You are free to explore as much as you want. You can learn about meditation, Buddhism and also be in contact with nature. The temple is beautiful plus very well located. The sunset is one of the best I've seen anywhere. Also, Jajae, (who is in charge of the temple stay,) is the nicest, warm hearted person that you will meet. I really recommend this temple stay for anyone, anytime and no matter from where you are."

The atmosphere and view was very good because there was surrounded beautiful mountains. The entrance fee was higher than I think, but it was money well spent. It was good experience to walking around this temple with cool wind. Recommendable temple.From the arrival to the departure, this is an experience to die for!!! I came with a group. The staff (monks included) ensured that we were treated with so much kindness!! The temple stay was an experience which indeed changed my life and I will never forget the bits of advice given by the monk during his address to us."

군산 일본식 가옥 (히로쓰 가옥),108건의<U+00A0>리뷰,전라북도 군산 구영1길 17,3위(18곳의 군산 소재 관광지 중),"It's just old Japanese style house with many visitors. I stop to think why this place is so popular. Maybe this house has sad history of Japanese colonial era in Korea.It is something a little different right in the center of the city. Seems to be very well preserved. It's winter through probably very beautiful in summer with everything in bloom and such. Still a lot of people wandering around.It's kind of small and there isn't much to see but it's interesting to see the architecture. It only took about 20 mins to see the whole thing.It looked exactly same as the photos. Although it was possible to see the details, the whole experience was not fascinating.There are many japanese-style houses in this area which have been well-preserved. Many travellers, young couples very often, come to see to feel and see the era of Japanese-ruled era when their parents lived. It is very good to take pictures here.This house is absolutely beautiful and well worth seeing, especially since so little residential architecture in the Japanese style that was built between 1910 and 1945 has survived into the modern era. For a short time you can imagine that you are in Japan. Unfortunately, there is very little explanatory information in English, and there don't seem to be any guided tours (although I could be wrong). If you could go inside, I would give it five stars, but you can't.It was a nice experience to visit this old Japanese house. Take a look at the structure! Even though it is a Japanese styled house, it has ondol system ( Korean heating system ) too on it! I would love to visit this place againquiet nice experience. you get a feeling of calmness and quiet which is nice to the busy city of gunsanThis well-built spacious house is worth a visit. Take a look at the structure and the artistic design of the garden. A special place.Gunsan is not really on anyone's tourist map. Frankly, there is not much to see here. However, it should be noted that Gunsan above else provides the inquisitive visitor with a plethora of historical sites related to the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945). The Old Gunsan Customs House and Donguksa Temple both in addition to Hirotsu House, are perhaps some of the best preserved buildings from that period. To provide clarity, I am not celebrating the Japanese colonial period, but it is without question a significant era of Korean history. Gunsan became a key port for Japan during the early 20th century. Gunsan today is rather sleepy compared to the role it played during Japanese control of Korea.Hirotsu House is an excellent example of a Japanese merchant home built during this period. The structure and compound are well-preserved. I commend the caretakers for preserving the structure despite ambivalent attitudes throughout Korea toward the preservation of ANY Japanese buildings. The garden is pleasant, and the woodwork is of high quality. Taken together with several other Japanese built properties in Gunsan, one begins to get a real sense of this port city under Japanese rule."
동국사,68건의<U+00A0>리뷰,전라북도 군산 동국사길 16,2위(18곳의 군산 소재 관광지 중),"Dongguksa Temple (동국사) is the last remnant of Japanese Buddhism in Korea, even though nowadays the temple follows the Korean Buddhism, the architecture is impressive. The temple stays still without the scars of the wars that assailed the peninsula, visiting it, is a visit to the year of 1919, the year that the Japanese occupation conducted a stronger occupation. The temple has very welcoming cats, that I even managed to take a photo of them Also the temple was used as location for the film Ode to the Goose (군산: 거위를 노래하다) directed by one of my favorite directors Zhang Lu. It was interesting to visit some of the locations for this film, the next posts I will explore those locations.C ( 19.08.03 ) The general temple was located in deep mountain, but this Dongguksa in the city's main street. And the temple's structure was Japanese style. So there was not general style temple, and had unique atmosphere. If on Gunsan trip, there was must visit in a short time. Small, but unique temple.Good place
Went there on Dec 2018
Visited with my colleagues 
Didn’t disappoint 
Close to Gunsan city DowntownBeautiful and historic site. It was built in Japanese imperial period.
Now a korean monk manages the temple.Nice Buddhist Temple in the city. They are rebuilding a lot of it. Several people walking around. Nice statue all dressed up. Went inside seen the budda and drum. Makes for some good pictures.The tour was in Korean so we didn't understand a thing but we walked around by ourselves. It was relaxing a peaceful.This is a japnese-style buddhist temple which was built in the japanese-ruled era. This is located near the japanese-style house village.Small, but very beautiful Japanese-style Buddhist temple, apparently the last one of its kind in Korea still operating as a Buddhist temple. For me, the most beautiful aspect of it was the backdrop of magnificent old-growth bamboo, which is also rare in Korea.Dongguksa is the only surviving Japanese style temple in Korea.  It is rather small, but pretty enough.  If you plan to visit, an hour is more than sufficient.

Overall, I was a little underwhelmed... but I can appreciate the significance of the temple.The temple built during the time of Japanese colonization of Korea gives a good example of how religion was used to aid the imperialism against ordinary people and makes one wonder whether and how peace between the two countries can be made.It is absolutely worth a visit along with other related sites in the area"

It has East & West gates both with equal attactions however west could be better. Evening , sunset is beautiful . Besides spending time can sip bear, side by hotels.Eunpa Lake Park has great paths and bridges you walk, ride, or just sit and enjoy the day. We rode through the park and crossed the lake on the wooden bridge. We watched folks practicing rowing on the lake and the park was not crowded on a Friday.Our favorite park in Kunsan. Walking around the lake during Spring season is so refreshing . So many beautiful flowers.A great place to run around the clock thanks to some lighted paths, and a wonderful place to spend some time for all: several great cafes and restaurants around the lake shore, and even some kids activities to keep little ones entertained. A great spot - particularly in the early morning to realize why Korea is known as the land of the morning calm.We see the 'Waterlight Bridge' all the time from my home windows. Not just looking out the window makes us breathtaking but also taking a walk anytime we want/need 24/7 with very fresh air surrounded by pure nature such as ducks swimming, very calmy peaceful but zig-zag curves around the huge lake gives us changeable fun!There are awesome cafes and restaurants here and there, so you must save a day or two to enjoy the beauty of the lake!You can see elderly using the little workout machines, kids in the playgrounds, often times the wedding halls across the street have a thing going on in the park. A little bit of everything. This is a great place to go if you are looking to past the time and want to see some nice scenery.I always enjoyed walking around this area. There’s a beautiful lake with a fountain. It’s great for a solo trip with your camera, going for a stroll with someone, or taking the family out to enjoy the day. I loved walking around Eunpa during all seasons. Bundle up and enjoy the snow covered ground and trees, or bring sunscreen and enjoy the lake on a hot sunny day. My favorite time is when the weather is a little cooler and the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. It’s very picturesque.This park has something for everyone.Go alone or take the family its always a good time to be had here.Park was not to busy on a Sunday afternoon. It is a great spot to run or walk around the lake. I will return once the weather cools down a bit"
구군산세관 본관,36건의<U+00A0>리뷰,전라북도 군산 장미동 49-38,7위(18곳의 군산 소재 관광지 중),"Fairly colorful at end of the street next to customs. Building was closed but you can stamp a card at end of the building.This building is a relic of the Japanese colonial administration. It has a handsome facade that lends itself nicely to group pictures. If you want to go inside, go around to the side door. Inside, you can pose for pictures at the customs inspector's desk and peruse some historical exhibits.This building is well-preserved and fun to pose for a picture in front. I don't know if it is ever open, but it is part of the walking tour and is a definite stopping spot. Take a look.This 115 year structure is of European design, a often common preference by Imperial Japan when constructing official government buildings. The survival of any Japanese building (of significance) from the Colonial period is quite exceptional. The Old Customs House has played a central role in the story of Japanese Colonialism in Korea. One of the buildings primary functions was as a gateway for Korean goods to be transferred to Japan (particularly rice). The exploitation of Korea by Japan (and some pro-Japanese Koreans) is evident for any visitor of historical Gunsan.For me the building (now a small museum) is a great starting point for visitors in Gunsan, specifically those who have historical curiosity. The building is quite small, but taken together with the other Japanese Colonial structures in the city, they provide a lasting picture of Pre- WWII Gunsan."

From what I heard it used to be someone's private property long time ago(must have been someone pretty rich). You can dress up in traditional clothes and go for a walk around, for a fee of course. There's also a small lake with giant fish inside. Not a lot to do but perfect for a relaxing afternoon walk after lunch.Garden with ancient gazebo and old trees, which are more than 400 years old. It's peaceful garden. There's the house to introduce Chunhyangjeon that is kind of love story composed around 300 years ago. That was interesting.It is a garden with a pavilion in the middle of the pond. There are activities that my kids really enjoyed like Korea giant swing and other Korean traditional games.Very nice garden. Peaceful. Beautiful landscaping. Can spend about an hr and half here. Fun traditional korean games in one corner of the garden. You can get your pictures clicked in traditional korean clothes. Worh a visit if you are in Namwon. There is a minimal fee to enter the garden. Also you can send a post card to your loved ones for free anywhere in the world from the Tourist information center in the garden.Gwanghallu is a place for traditional party in a beautiful garden.To appreciate the place to its full potential, you have to know about the Choseon dynasty's gardens which can be classified into three different categories: Royal gardens; public (built by local goverments) gardens and private gardens (built by rich aristocrats)Good examples of each would be the garden of Changdeokgung palace; Gwanhalluwon and Soswaewon(Damyang). Namwon used to be an important large town in the southern part of Korea with variety of agricultural goods from Jeolla province. So the public garden built by Namwon govmn't was pretty huge and beautiful with manmade pond and islands. The garden itself was made to resemble the utopia of Taoism. Three islands were made to represent three holy mountains namely Bonglae mt (蓬萊山), Bangjang mt (方丈山) and Youngju mt (瀛洲山). On each island crape myrtle, bamboo were planted along with a small gazebo. The water drawn in from the near by river was representing the milky way and the only bridge that crossed milky way was believed to be Ojkagyo, and the bridge in Gwanhalluwon was named so. (Ojakgyo is from another traditional story)Gwanhalluwon is also famous for the setting of Chunhyangjeon, the oldest Korean romance story and you can find a shrine for Chunhyang and a model of her mother's house in Gwanghalluwon. During the winter time, the park opens until 8 pm. After 6 pm, you don't have to pay the entrance fee which is 2500 KRW per person during the day time.I really enjoyed Gwanghallu. The layout of the area is relaxing and enjoyable. A few buildings on the grounds, but the pond was great (loads of big fish looking for a snack) and I thoroughly enjoyed the ancient and awesome trees spread throughout. Plenty of picture opportunities. Cheap entrance fee, 2,500 I think. Unfortunately we couldn't go in the evening...the website said open until 10pm but the place actually closes at 8. The tourist info guide (in the very small building inside of the gates) was pleasant helpful for Namwon and other nearby towns and cities. Also interesting to try out the giant swing!We visited Gwanghallu in the early evening as the light was beginning to fade and it was simply idyllic. The pavillions and ponds and the gardens that they are surrounded by were really beautiful and a great place to daydream of days gone by in Korea. I think this spot is particularly good for couples, as the beautiful scenery has a distinct air of romance. Leaving the Gwanghallu park there was a row of well kitted out souvenir stalls too which are run by the local community and sell many attractive and curious Korean goods.Gwanghallu is a short walk from the bus station and is a pleasant park with a pavillion bridge, and pond. There are several good restaurant to eat in around the park. The park is famous because of the Chunhyang who was a woman in the Joseon dynasty who refused the advances of a local magistrate. You can dress up in hanbok at several locations around the park."

The one for Naesosa is directly outside the Hi Dental Clinic and the timetable is attached. On the first Saturday of November there was a concert at Naesosa, only one a year apparently, brilliant. Lovely (but steep) trails around.It's one of my favorite 5 temples. Buseoksa, Gaesimsa, Muwisa, Nesosa and Unmunsa. I can feel comfortable whenever I'm here, it always makes me think who I am, where I am from and where I'm going to. It would be better sitting at front yard chair, simultaneously looking at the main building Daewoongjun and thinking of what I said above for a while.This is my favorite temple to visit in the area, I have actually visited this temple in every season, from the car park it is a nice walk past the many restaurants and through the woodland to the temple, I am sure you can even have a nights stay at the temple and experience the way the monks live, it is not free but if you are interested in it why not give it a try, I personally haven't done this but I was told you can do it, on the way back from the temple stop of at one of the restaurants, have some food and if you are not driving have some Makgeollie. One piece of advise during Korean holiday this Temple is very busy, best to avoid travel at this timeDid a free-style temple stay and it was a very enriching experience. The Templestay coordinator (who speaks English) was helpful and thoughtful. The surrounding area is very good for walking/trekking. The landscape is pretty and the air is refreshing. The temple food is tasty. Indeed a rewarding trip. We travelled from Seoul To Jeongup by KTX, and then by bus to Naesosa.Okay so getting here was tricky. If you can it seems that you can see so much more more convuebtly if you have a car. I don't have a car. I took the interxity bus to Buan. After a short walk across the street, to the four way untersection, cross and then walk down the row of local buses on the right of the street. Then took the number 300 local bus to Naesosa. It takes about 1 hour and there is a ten minute break 30 minutes into the ride but you don't neet ro get odd there. The local bus is about 2,200 won.Excellent location , between the mountains and natural beauty. Highlights of byseonbando national park. Offbeat location but beautiful. Other than the old temple the hike to jisokonpopko falls is tough but great. You need to be in good physical condition to do itI went to this temple with my school when first arrived in Korea. It was really nice and scenic. Great for pictures and taking in the sights.CY ( 2015.12.30 ) This temple located in Byunsan National park, and had old main temple. The road to temple was very good and not so far. I couldn't find special thing, but all was good. Except tout in entrance, the road, atmosphere and temple was good. If you visit Byunsan National park, go this temple.There is a very old tree at the entrance to this temple. Plenty of restaurants at the entrance too. When you pass the entrance, you will walk for about 15 minutes before reaching the temple. A great place."

Admittedly they varied from year to year depending on weather conditions. This year, the summer was unusually long and the weather was dry, so the autumn colours were inferior to those of last year. It was also a cloudy day with very little sunshine, so the visit was a little disappointing. The consolation was that the sun came out momentarily when I was taking photos of the Uhwajeong Pavilion.Stayed in Naejangsan for 3 nights in Haniljang Motel in the 1st week of November 19 which located very near to park entrance. The peak of foliage is on 2nd week of November this year. The foliage is beautiful even though it is not at its peak. The weather is very cold in the morning that we have to wear gloves and the sky is dark at 5pm. Tourist could buy park entrance ticket at 3000won/day at the entrance and walk a short distance to a ticket booth to buy the shuttle bus tickets at 1000won/way. The bus will go to cable car station. For those who do not go to the observatory, I would suggest to walk towards the Wooden gate and up Naejangsan temples for sightseeing instead. From the temples walk back cable car bus stop and another 4km back to park entrance, towards the Naejang Information Centre. In this journey you will expect to hear local musicians singing lovely songs, see beautiful and colorful foliage, serene pavilion and few tangerine trees. A short distance outside the park entrance, there are tents where the local sell their meals. Along the roadsides there are sale of fry red bean and ginseng fritters, seasonal small tangerine and persimmon, etc. There are many restaurants but only one coffee cafe and convenience store beside 171 bus stop. At the cable car station, there is a lotteria fast food restaurant selling burger and it opens at 7am. For tourists who do not prepare for hiking I do not suggest to take one way cable car to observatory and walk down as the route down is slippery and not much to see. Overall, we had enjoyed the Naejangsan National Park very much. A must visit place during autumn in Korea.At the foot of the mountain, you can either take a bus (1000 won) or hike up. I decided t take the bus going up and then walk going down. The last week of October, is not exactly the peak of autumn, but there are yellow/red leaves already.I would suggest to go the temple first, then, start the hike down. On the way down you can see the pavilion in the middle of a river and pretty bridges. This is 4 hours by bus from Seoul, so be prepared for the long travel time.Naejangsan is one of the most beautiful place to admire colorful foliage in autumn in Korea. It has a long line trees that turn into yellow and red in autumn. You can take a bus (1,000krw) to near to the cable car station. Don't forget check in at the beautiful lake near there and take the cable car to admire the whole view Naejangsan. The best time to admire foliage is on novembreWe visited on 28/10/2019 but only 30% of the leaves turn yellow n red. A bit disappointed, pls come at middle November I guess for the autumn peak foliage best views. We followed Klook tours from Seoul to here (cheaper than train) then we took bus 171(every 30mins, 1000Won) from national park to Jeongeup-si, then change another bus (4900won) to Jeonju-si. Don’t worry about the bus , many buses are there.. We overnight at Jeonju-si hanok village before departing for Busan the next day.Naejangsan Visitor Centre->Byeongnyeonam, Seoraebong, Bulchulbong, Manghaebong, Yeonjibong, Kkachibong, Sinseonbong, Yeonjabong->Naejangsa Temple->Visitor Centre again. I didn’t get to Janggunbong as I worried about getting dark soon. I started the trail at 9:45am. By the time I reached back to the Visitor Centre it was 3:45pm. There were a lot of clear signs, but at times, especially at heights where places were rocky it’s difficult to tell where the route is. There are places that are steep and climbing is needed. I was using KT and I felt I had signal through the whole hike. I took the 7:10am bus from Jeonju bus terminus to Jeongeup bus terminus, which was a ~1hr10min ride. The stop of Bus 171, which takes passengers to Naejangsan National Park, is just 50 meters away from Jeongeup bus terminus. However by the time I arrived at the bus stop, two Filipinos told me the bus has just left. I talked to a taxi driver. He agreed to take us three to Naejangsan at W15000. The taxi ride was only 20 minutes (and we beat one bus 171!). We got off at where the shops were. I walked a bit further to something like an entrance, was told to hop onto a shuttle bus (with price W1000) and was dropped off at the Visitor Centre. I went there on 22 Oct. Too sad that it’s not yet time for leaves to turn fiercely red. Not gonna lie the hike was exhausting. My leg muscles were still sore two days after the hike and my toes were still hurt. But views at the tops are amazing.Autumn view at Naejangsan was beautiful. 4 hours bus journey from Seoul. Book your day trip from local Seoul travel agency at least 1 week, else you will miss your chance of a wonderful hike to the mountain top.My partner and I were fortunate to time our South Korean visit such that we were able to visit Naejangsan National Park in the first week of November. Just a very few leaves had begun to fall, which meant we must have visited at the peak autumn colours period. It was magnificent! I cannot advise what the park is like at other times of the year, although I assume it would still be an amazing place to visit. However, if you have any way of managing the timing of your visit, then do try to do it for the last week of October, or preferably the first week of November. Because of its popularity in Autumn, it was generally very busy with many thousands of people there on the day we visited. However, this park is so large, with many walking paths in and around the main touristy areas, that the numbers of people present really did not cause any problem to us whatsoever.From what we understand, no private cars OR tourist coaches are permitted to enter the main body of the park. Instead, all must park in one of two or three large parking areas on the outskirts. Then you can either walk the kilometre or so up into the main part of the park, OR you can buy tickets for a special bus that will save you the uphill walk. Our tour group ere provided with one-way such tickets to get us quickly into the main part of the park, on the understanding that the return trip was a beautiful downhill walk back to the main business, restaurant, and parking areas. The return walk downhill (and there were a couple of different path alternatives...) was extremely easy, and very enjoyable. In our case, we took the slightly longer return path down beside the small stream back to the shops and restaurants at the main entrance.There are a wide variety of restaurants and food stalls to choose from, assuming you plan to buy your lunch here.A thoroughly recommended visit, and would strongly suggest first week of November for the very best and brilliant autumn colours.We came second week of Nov, a little late for autumn as most trees were already leafless but still lovely and dramatic for photo ops :)Unlike Seoraksan Mountain which is very popular among foreigner, Naejangsan National Park is less popular but really beatiful specially in autumn and it is one of the best autumn spot among domestic visitor. For budget traveller, after 3.5 hours journey to Jongeup station (Mugunghwa train), take local bus 171 to Naejangsan National Park directly."

Instead of visiting one of those highly Sinicized Joseon Palaces, it is great to visit this site and the museum to understand the true classical heritage of Korea. It is one of the most serene and peaceful places I could visit.Well this is too far but it is ok to visit. There are nothing much inside but the area is huge. As it used to be temple in old time so the preserve well.C1 ( 2015.08.05 ) This place was old temple site, and there was a little relics. Though this place was famous for Baekje's site, but not many things to see. Big temple pagoda was restoring and had wide site. If this pagoda finish restoring, this place was very beautiful place.There WAS a temple, hundreds years ago, but now? nothing. If you're fond of history, or majoring in Korean or East Asian history, this place might worth a visit. Otherwise, spend more time in Jeonju, or other major cities.Although the site was totally destroyed, one of the stone pagodas have been rebuild, and tge other one is currently been rebuild too. The museum, free of access is very interesting, and it explains very well how the temple used to look like. The people in the museum don't actually speak english, but they are very nice and try to be as helpful as possible.Although at one time it must have been very impressive, it is currently being repaired and it's not possible to see the big stone pagodas which used to be 30 meters in height because they are behind some wooden structure. There was a small scale model of how the temple used to look and it was a bit difficult to get there by bus as it was about an hour bus ride and then a quick look around, and then waiting for a return bus. Unless you are very interested in this temple, I would recommend waiting until they finish their rebuilding before going."

In weekday, there was almost no traveler and had calm atmosphere. Sometimes, there was held experience how make cheese, and could experience. We went around this theme park and there was good to walk. It was inconvenient that some facility was closed in weekday.When you are in Imsil, you must take the opportunity to visit the Imsil Cheese Theme Park. This theme park houses different play areas like the rolling slide, animal (goat) area, cheese building, playground, etc. You can also try their cheese making courses (e.g. pizza making, mozzarella cheese making, etc.).

Some really lovely photographs.An interesting church you can pop into but not walk around too much. It struck me as being very simple compared to the elaborate gold encrusted churches of the catholic faith in the West.Small Catholic Church - yes, pretty architect and lovely stained glass windows but if you are Catholic you will be touched and moved by the powerful presence of the area. I found myself in tears sitting in the pews. This church sits on the site of the first Korean Catholic Martyrs and that spirituality is very clearly present. If you are comfortable with this - please go and allow yourself to be present and you might also find it to be very moving. There are beautiful and poignant statues around the grounds. This appears to be a very popular photo site for locals to dress up in traditional attire - who are totally respectful of the area.This church is at the street end of Jeonju Hanok Village. Big carpark near the church. There are worshippers when my family visit the church.Jeondong Catholic Church is easily visible from several directions with its tall tower.We didn't go inside but from the outside is a standard Catholic church. Worth a passing visit.An old church of Korean. Pretty small and almost all of the staffs only use Korean. Okay for being a photo-stop.I came here during my visit to Jeonju Hanok Village. Can be reach by walking. Many people taking some pictures here in front of the church.While I have not went inside of this beautiful building, it is something I am reviewing because everytime you see it, you always stare in aww at it. I've seen this building at least 15 to 20 times. This building is located right around the beginning of Hanok Village, and it is a significant landmark in Jeonju. A trip inside of the building would have to be amazing. Whenever I go to Korea again, I will be sure to go inside and leave another review!The staff are unfriendly as hell. We were trying to go for the 5pm mass, but unfortunately 4.50-ish pm is also when they're ushering the non-worshippers out as well. We were rudely shoved out the gate TWICE until I managed to get through to the staff in broken Korean that we were just trying to go for mass!! When I say shoved, I mean shoved - the guard took us by the arm and PUSHED us out. Not an experience I'd care to repeat. The church itself is beautiful, certainly worth a visit. Try to go before 4.30pm so you don't get manhandled.Part of the Jeonju Hanok Village. Taking photo is difficult as it’s crowded. Constructed in 1908 & completed in 1914."

덕진공원,62건의<U+00A0>리뷰,전라북도 전주 덕진구 덕진동2가 1314-4,5위(55곳의 전주 소재 관광지 중),"After a huge dinner at the excellent 'Gogung' restaurant nearby (try the yukhoe, it's incredible) we went to see the musical fountain at Deokjin Park. It was evening and the atmosphere was relaxed and romantic. There are massive lily beds in the lake and a cafe in the centre - but the best place to watch the musical fountain is from the south end of the wobbly bridge that connects to the island cafe in the centre of the lake. As night fell we sat and waited and gradually a trickle of other couples arrived and found benches to sit on to watch the fountain display. It was very romantic in the evening, with nice lights, a lady selling candyfloss and made even better by having a bottle of soju to share.The fountain display itself was great! Kpop, Queen, Pirates of the Caribbean all played along with several fountain jets, lights and a laser display. Worth the trip from the Hanok Village where we were staying.I did not visit in the daytime but I did see they had some duckboats... if that's your thing :)Small lake good for a 10-15mins walk. Filled with ducks and hugely grown lotuses running wild which makes for quite a sunset sight.Flew a drone and the sunset shots are spectacular.I visited the park 15 years ago, it hasn't changed a great deal over the years, but it is just as peaceful as it has always been. When Korea hosted the soccer world cup Deokjin set up big screens so that the local people could gather together, Deokjin is still very much a local park.This past June, a group of foreign students who are studying in Korea and I visited Deokjin Park. It is right next to Chonbuk National University.The weather was sunny and bright. We decided to order pizza and bring it on the duck boats with us. The duck boat passenger maximum is four persons. So we had two boats. We opted for the paddle boats. The other choice is an automatic motorized boat with a power button and a reverse button and steering wheel. The prices are reasonable if you split it between four people. The peddle boat was 12,000/hr while the automatic one slightly more.Before boarding, you go through a line to don your life jacket and are directed to the boat you're assigned.At one point during our hour on the water, we decided to do a race to the edge of the lake towards a pavilion. It was a sight to see- these two boats moving as fast as they could peddle to reach the wall. In the pavilion, there were some old men playing chess and hanging out, watching us go. We had soooooo much fun.The lake is medium-sized and offers its own attraction in the form of animals: mini-turtles, ducks on the water and jumping fish.When our time (1 hour) was up, our boat numbers were called over the loudspeaker and we were expected to return to the dock. We brought the boat to the dockside and disembarked, returned our life jackets and went home.I recommend this activity (not the race per se) for the warmer months. The boats are unavailable during winter. It's a fun activity for older children and kids-at-heart.The lakeside park is very clean, and it is great to walk around it. There are also two bridges going across the water. You can hire pedal boats or bicycles, and there are a few flower gardens, as well as a waterfall. The 'musical fountain' also occasionally has a routine of firing jets that is fun to watch.I visited Deokjin Park during winter and sadly all the lotus flowers have dried up across the river. It will however be a very magnificent view if you were to visit in Spring or Summer when the flowers are in bloom!Deokjin Park is a lovely place to take a stroll and just enjoy the breeze. Would love to revisit again next time!The park is quite large and the lake is ""divided"" into two sections; one has boats which can be rented and the other is the famous lotus pond. No flowers in mid-October but lots of leaves and seed pods. Lots of very large trees and shrubs, but almost no lawns. Parks in Korea are very clean .... NO trash and few trash cans.The park is near the very large, modern Sori Auditorium.a great place to take pictures even if it was summer. The lotus pond is fantastic and the flowers were blooming!This park is located near Jeonbuk National University. Local people likes this park. This park is very beautiful when lotus flowers are in full bloom.We enjoyed our walk to the lake. There were some picturesque pavilions and nice sculptures in the park. We did not go to the zoo (which we think is there, somewhere)."

Beautiful views over Hanok village. Serene surroundings with the tall trees. Worth climbing the hill.It's an easy walk from the main entrance to the hanok village up the main round & see a slope to the right, follow this & the wooden stair case to the open area with Omokdae shrine pavilion. Follow the wooden stairs & walk ways from the area to find great views over the hanok village roof tops. Take the bridge over the road to the other side for the Imokdae areaTry to reach Omokdae and feel relax in the gazebo, by hiking a little while and get a full landscape of Jeonju.These two locations are next to one another on a hill top close to the centre of Jeonju. The walk up is a short, fairly steep climb, not too difficult. Good vies of the Hanok village can be had on the climb. Worth a short detour to see the views.We walked uphill from Jeonju hanok village to visit Omokdae and Imokdae. The pavilions are both beautiful, but we were expecting better views after reading the reviews. There wasn't any view of the hanok village from either of the pavilions, instead there's a partial view from the path up the hill to Omokdae. Nice to visit if you have lots of time, but certainly not a must-see.It is situated on a little hill that overlooks the Hanok Village...A historical site where first Joseon King celebrated his victory over the Japanese...During fall, beautiful leaves compliment the two site very well...lots of beautiful photos can be taken here.Built in memory for Yi Seong-gye, the first King of the Joseon Dynasty. Between the Jaman Mural village and Hanok Village, this is a good go-between linking the 2.Omokdae features a pavillion and is elevated across the Mural village, offering good views and a good stop to rest.You can step on a small hill ^^ to see the view of Jeonju hanok. You can spend the time for ralaxing at here.Not far from the Hanok Village on top of a small hill is the sight known as Omokdae, it is here that Yi Seong-gye, who would become the first King of the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1897), stayed after a victorious win against Japanese pirates at Hwangsan. A stunning open-sided pavilion monument was erected in 1900 to remember the event. The sight is free to visit. From the Hanok Village there is a small climb up a hill then a set of stairs to arrive at the pavilion. On the day of our visit we were the only foreigners there when several young Korean school children out on a day excursion came over to us keen to practice their English with us. We have a fond memory of this experience.From the top of this hill there are glimpses over the rooftops of neighbouring Hanok villages through the scattered trees."

Although seems quite touristic area, but it's worth to visit.Lots of local people in traditional costumes. The village covers alarge artea but still gets busy, Not sure how authentic the village is however for the western toursit its still pretty cool. Its nice just to wander around and especially at night, Prices are a bit steep in some of the cafes however I guess its an expensive place to run a business. Lovely.We spent our first day just wandering around and discovered there was a tour in English at 3pm so we joined this the second day. We were the only Brits alongside a Belgian couple, Hong Kong nationals and a German couple and a few others. The tour takes you to all the main sites and I suggest you then go back later if you like. We ended in the excellent paper factory (the only original place where they hand make the traditional hanji (made from the inner bark of ‘paper mulberry’, a tree native to Korea that grows on rocky mountainsides). Prices are incredibly reasonable so stock up here.The day was cold and sunny, perfect to take around! The village is not so big, so it is possible to visit in one day, including the areas around it. I needed to use the restroom and I got impressed how clean it was! Beatiful pleace for nice pictures. I strong recommend this visit!The traditional buildings are so beautiful. One will experience the relaxed pace of lifestyle with lots of good food here. The people here are friendly and nice.The place was teaming by school children. It’s very touristy and some bits gimmick. The magic of Hanok was diluted with tacky tourist shops. The craft shops was fantastic. We took a free guided tour and was definitely worthwhile.Very nice place with vivid atmosphere. It Is full of asian tourists. Various restaurants and coffee shops.Great to walk around - really cute and awesome shops for food and souvenirs.

Nearly all the buildings are in the traditional style. Lots of hanoks for guest stays - makes a lovely stay if you want to sample the traditional. Lots of shops, stalls & restaurants - some traditional, some selling modern products. It is a lovely place to stroll in the evening when the crowds disperse. Avoid weekends - it's heaving & as the roads are closed - lots of people hire bikes, scooters, segways & buggies - the roads are just full of them dashing around with no regard for pedestrians.Weekdays & evenings are more relaxed. Try traditional korean food at restaurants & stalls - & korean drink. There are many cultural places within the village & ask at the tourist info for any displays/shows that may be on.If you choose to go for a hanok stay the area is very quiet at night so not a problem for sleep etc"

There is lots to see, felt a lot more relaxing and plenty places to sit and relax taking in the atmosphere. Highly recommended.This area of quiet in the busy village is nice to wander around. The buildings are from the Joseon dynasty & are enclosed by a surrounding wall. The gate way leads to the main buildings with smaller court yards & buildings off.The area also has the Royal portrait museum (covering the key portrait of King Taejo)good, historical visit. Make sure to take the docent led tour (they have English-speaking guides). there is also the museum to walk through. Worth an hour on your visit to Jeonju.At the center of the Hanok Village, this shrine (erected in 1400) is one of the most interesting things to see in Jeonju.Entrance Fee is only 3.000 won per person.There's a little ""bamboo-forest"", pretty famous to be a nice background for photos.Take a slow walk through this shrine!!!!The Gyeonggijeon shrine is in the centre of the Hanok village. It is a complex of pavilions, shrines, store buildings from the Josean Dynesty. There is an entrance fee, but we turned up at lunchtime and the ticket office was closed so we were let in for free (not that the entrance fee is large), Many Koreans had rented traditional dress and were taking photographs around the complex. One of the buildings has manuscripts from the Josean Dynesty, other buildings house various museum pieces on daily life.Gyeonggijeon shrine/palace is a beautiful group of buildings in the Jeonju hanok village. We visited at 09:30am, half an hour after opening, and it was quiet. The buildings and trees are really beautiful, and there's a small bamboo grove that is gorgeous. You can go inside lots of the buildings, which is great. We didn't visit the portrait gallery museum, and it took us a bit less than an hour to see everything else.You probably won't spend more than an hour here unless you're taking photos in the traditional hanbok costumes~ Paid an entrance fee and received a map in English. Don't forget to check out the museum.It is 3.000 for the entrance ticket. You’ll need about 30min to 1h for the visit and it is located at the entrance of the traditional village, so very easy to reach.The shrine in itself has nothing extraordinary but is a nice and quiet place to visit. During autumn it is actually very nice for pictures.Fortunately, there is a fee language guide program, through which you can get a good guide speaking English. The entrance fee is about 3 USD, it's almost for free considering the free English Guide. Kyoungkijeon, it has the portrait of the first king of Chosun Dynasty. It depicts the king exactly with the same appearance. No adding at all. And also this place is used as an altar for important figures of Seongrihak(an academic studying developed from the confucionism. it's based on the confucious belief). So Confucius is included in the figures. It has deep history. You can hear of it from one of the guides there.  The books of the annals on the Chosun Dynasty are also preserved well here.  You can see how strict and strong the confucious belief was in Korea. It was more than a religion. 다행기게도 무료 해설 프로그램이 있어서... 입장료가 3,000원인데 그정도야... 낸다. 해설사 비용도 안나오겠더라... 거의 공짜라고 본다. 경기전, 태조의 초상화를 포함해서 성리학 위인들의 위패를 모셔놓은 곳, 조선왕조실록도 모셔놓았던 곳!!!! 그리고 그걸 지키려했던 선조들의 노력!!!! 경기전, 조선 태조 이성계의 초상화를 모신 곳이다. 태종은 1410년 전주·경주·평양에 태조의 모습을 그린 초상화를 모시고 어용전이라 하였다. 그 후 태종 12(1412)에 태조 진전이라 부르다가 세종 24년(1442)에 와서 전주는 경기전, 경주는 집경전, 평양은 영숭전으로 달리 이름을 지었다. 경기전은 임진왜란 때 불탄 것을 광해군 6년(1614)에 다시 고쳐 지었다. 건물의 구성은 본전·헌·익랑 들로 이루어져 있고 이를 내삼문과 외삼문으로 둘렀다고 한다.해설사의 설명을 들어보면 한국에선 건물 하나를 지을 때도 그냥 아무렇게나 지은게 아니고 하나하나 모두 그 뜻이 있다고 한다. 저 기둥도 뭔가 뜻이 있다고 하는데... 아, 뭐라고했는지 까묵었다...  경기전 이 건물은 다행이게도 불타지 않고 보존되었다고 하더라. 광해군 이후로... 다른 곳은 다 타고 없어져버렸는데.... 전주에는 이렇게 지켜진게 많다. 조선시대야 그 근원이 '농사'였고 평야와 농사의 중심지였던 이곳 '전주'가 자연스럽제 중요한 도시였음은 자연스러운 일이라고 하겠다....해설사의 얘기를 듣다보면 일본에 대한 악감정이 안생길 수가 없다. 뭔가 만들어 놓으면 어김없이 일본이와서 다 파괴했으니까... 그 와중에 전주의 시민들은 우리 조상들은 그 유산을 지키기 위해서 목숨을 걸어야 했고....초상화는 털하나도 빠지지 않고 그릴만큼 사실적으로 묘사한 게 특징이다. 경기전 안에는 태조 이성계 어진을 모신 곳과, 규장각처럼 조선왕조실록과 서적을 보관하던 곳, 그리고 성리학 성인의 위패를 모신 곳이 있다. 각각 이름이 있지만 일일이 기억하지는 못한다. 성리학도 결국 중국의 학문에서 온 것이고 언어도 중국의 언어를 기반으로 한 '한자'였으니... 엄밀히 따지자면 전통 한국은 아니었다라고 해야 할까? 성리학의 명과 암이라고 할 수 있겠다....People walk around wearing hanbok.

My kids and I enjoyed the experience.Worth it.It is an interesting place to visit. There are some fruit stalls nearby and selling nice oranges and grapes.The attraction is not so exciting but still worth a visit if it is your first time in Jeju. This attraction is also pretty near Jeju's Loveland, an interesting and popular attraction that is not mentioned in TripAdvisor.Not the only place in the World to claim fame to a road that looks uphill while running downhill. Didn’t get any excitement from this “wonder” of the World.A magnetic hill. Interesting if you’ve never seen one before. Otherwise, just another hill where your car appears to roll uphill.Went to this as part of a tour. The view from the coach as your “defying gravity” is of a coach full of people craning their necks not straight ahead which you need to get the perspective. This is something thats maybe worth doing on the way to somewhere else but don’t go out of your way for it.We drove past it on another parallel road and didnt realise how fun it was! So we made it a point to visit it and try it out before we returned the rental car. The speed went up to almost 20km/h! We didnt encounter any local motorists though there were some tourists placing water bottles to see them roll up the hill :)I wouldn't say this is a must visit attraction. Our driver took some time to show us this place since we were passing thru. The kids found it somewhat interesting, we spent about 10 mins trying out the optical illusion in the car.I tried walking and rolling in car to feel the effects of such claims... no luck, felt cheated... at least the kids had fun.It this is on the way to your other destination, then no harm dropping by. We just drove past by the road, then came down to take some picture. A 10 min pit stop. Nothing fanciful. Not a big deal to give this a miss."

제주 절물 자연 휴양림,114건의<U+00A0>리뷰,제주 봉개동,6위(159곳의 제주 소재 관광지 중),"30 mins drive out from Jeju City. My Wife and Daughter accompanied me on the first 2.5km of the 11.1km yellow route, then they took a short cut back (around 1.2km) to relax at the Korean style picnic tables and visit the carp pond. I took another 1.5 hrs or so to complete the yellow route, which by the way is circular, not an up and back as reported sometimes previously. I came across plenty of deer, as well as some beautiful birds and flowers. The first 5km or so has hessian Mats to walk on, which is very peasant, but then it gets a bit muddy and rocky, with a few steep sections.....walking boots or trail shoes are definitely best, although possible in Trainers. Really enjoyed the hike.We went with our boys for a short hiking. Jeomul Oreum trail is shady and only takes 45min. There are few junctions at the top of the trail which might be confusing. The maps say one big round trail, ultimately it is the same way up and down. If you took the wrong trail, it will lead to 5km trail. Overall good and short trail for the kids.The locals come here for a picnic. This place also has a few playgrounds for children. If you ever wanted to go to the observatory, it would require some hiking so wear proper clothes. Was the view worth the hike? I think other places in Jeju provide better views than the one here.There are lots of walks but very badly marked.They are colour coded but the trails arn't.Very confusing especially if you can't read Korean.They range between 1-11 kms long.In march all the trees were still bare so not very attractive walks.The park was quiet when I visited. It was an easy walk with nice trees and scenery. It had a great calming effect on me. Love it. Just 5 minutes drive from the park is the Hanwha Resort Jeju which I went for a fantastic spa treatment. My afternoon was made perfect !It was such a nice experience at Jeolmul Natural Forest Resort. The location is so scenic that no pictures do any justice.A very beautiful and peaceful, cooling place. Full of natural trees. I went after rain,vision not clear from hill top. But I love this natural scenery. It is money back guarantee for Korean people if can not view anything from hill top with heavy mist. Anyway announcement were made if there is heavy mist during rain.Understand there are three courses here - 30 mins, 60 and 90. Basically it’s a very light forest with pine and a few other trees that I am not familiar with. You choose the course and just take your time to walk - the air is fresh, nobody speaks loudly. The path will meander through trees, laughing statues, water fountain, and more trees. Would definitely recommend coming this place for those who want to calm their nerves and leave the city behind. We took the 30 mins course and came out refreshed.After the big snow fall last week, 2/3 place is closed to visit however, still the rest of part that I can visit and walk around were super great! Admission is 1,000 KRW(less than a 1 USD, 0.80Euro, maybe). There is small sack kiosk at the entrance/ parking lot. They have very nice OMEGI rice cake and fish cake soup(oden)!! Great taste and owners are very kind and smiley. In the forest, there is small Buddhist' temple where provides free 3 in 1 coffee and green tea bag with hot water. Looking inside of temple was also great pleasure. There is pond and feet washing place but it was not accessible today due to the heavy snow. One thing I also loved very much and spent more than 30 min inside, is "" experience building for phytoncide"" in Korean, 산림욕, 山林浴! Cozy and warm after the cold from outside walk, and I loved the smell of natural woods inside. They have 4 different type of rooms, as far as I remember. On my way back to hotel, I met local gentlemen, they told me Summer is the BEST to visit and can feel real Phytoncide with great ambiance. Even I could not visit whole places, it worth to be there. If you visit there now or winter, please make sure your shoes, like hiking shoes or bring your EISEN, protecting gear against sliding. Kids will love this place too.This is a well maintained natural forest. You can walk here after visiting the Roe Deer Observation Centre or take the Jeju City bus. There are many trails and a fair amount of visitors. Entrance fee is payable and a car park is available at the entrance."

거문오름,42건의<U+00A0>리뷰,제주 조천읍 선교로 569-36 (우) 63341,35위(159곳의 제주 소재 관광지 중),"오름은 오르기 쉬웠고 가이드분 설명도 훌륭했습니다. 지질학적으로나 식물학적으로나 가치가 큰 곳이라 한번쯤 방문하시는 걸 추천합니다. 하지만 예약이 필수고 매주 화요일은 휴무이니 유의하셔야 합니다. The oreum was not that difficult to hike, and the guide provided quite a nice explanation. Geologically and Botanically meaningful place to visit. But reservation is mandatory, and every Tuesday is off.UNESCO World Natural Heritage. Geomun Oreum represents more than 300 oreums in Jeju Island. By experiencing the primitive form and history of oreum, u can learn the awe of nature. Anyone who wants to know the essence of Jeju Island must challenge. Even if u do not understand Korean, u will be impressed by what you see. Reservation required.If u do not object natural scenicThis place is the most value for money u must visit. Entrance fee is only 2000w for adults . easy walking path for child.the only deficit is the tour guide can only speak in korean. The most amazing wonder is the entrance fee includes a 25 minutes well filemed 4D movieWe drove ourselves and although a little hard to find, it was worth the effort. The area was quite well set out with information and small local restaurant and gift shop area. Entry is free to Jeju workers but about 5,000 won - the steps down are step but well made. We walked about 2 kms to the end of the tunnel - it was damp, cold and generally well lit. Wear sturdy shoes and a warm coat, take a water bottle. Worth a look.It was unfortunate that the immersion tour group was delayed in setting out on a one hour journey to this natural heritage centre that we were not allowed to visit the 5 lava tubes. However the 4D film of a little boy 's adventure on this island more than made up for the disappointment of not visiting the lava tubes. It would have been a great trekking experience to the lava tubes from the museum exhibits & brochures ... perhaps it warrants another visit to this island?I went with three friends to Geomunoreum on a Sunday in February 2016. The first thing I'd recommend is ensuring that your taxi driver takes you to the right place as ours dropped us off an hour's walk away from where we were supposed to be at an abandoned building.When we finally got to the Oreum we got in for free as Jeju English teachers. I think the prices were around 5KWon per person without Jeju residency.We had to join a tour group (obviously Korean-speaking guide) for the whole walk. The stops were far too regular and spoke for too long. This is why the route options are 1 hour/2.5hours/3.5hours (I think), because the guiding makes them so long! I guess it was our fault for not being able to understand, but it did mean the walk was interrupted and the experience ruined a little by travelling in a pack. We tried to pace ourselves between groups but kept getting trapped in them. I don't think you can do this walk without a guide.That said, the views were beautiful.We went with high expectation, thinking that we could go into the larva tube. To our utmost disappointment, besides a 4-D movie, It was just a museum with some picture exhibits, and glassed up exhibits of a very small part of the larva tube. Admission was W3,000. It took us a long time to get there, as the bus was a 50 minute wait and it was extremely cold that day.This is not a common attraction but it's a place where we can follow the path and walk around the crater. Though pitifully there is no more water in the crater, it's still an interesting place to visit. The walk just take around 30 minutes. Apart from the crater, it's also a good place to overlook the plains and farmlands.The only offset of this site is its accessibility and limited car park. There is no public transport to go to this place. We drove by ourselves. After we drove off the main road, we entered a small road to the peak. The path is so narrow that only one car can go through, but it is for two-way traffic.Please visit this place only if you really love and in great passion to help preserve the nature. This attraction requires reservation as it only allow 400 hikers daily. There are 10 sessions and 3 different trails, a one-hr one, a 2.5-hr and a 3.5-hr one. All hikers will be lead by a center guide. Though the guide speaks only Korean and knows only limited English, there are signage and descriptions on each special location.We joined the first session and started at 9. We were required to arrive at least 10 minutes before 9, then bought the ticket (2000 won each) and showed the tickets to the Information Desk. Then we were given a badge which we needed to put on all the time and returned to the Desk after the hike. No food, including candies and gums, are allowed. Only water, without colours or tastes, is allowed to bring into the site. There is a water machine inside the Information Desk.The ""Gotjawal"" forests, grow in the center of the Geomunoreum crater, are very dense and luxuriant. While you can only look from the outlook points at Sangumburi 山君不離 and Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone 城山日出峰, this activity is an authentic encounter inside the crater, with the geological formation, vegetation and traits of lava activities"

Even if you don't buy anything, it's worth checking it out. The clothing is very inexpensive. Lots of cell phone stores but they only work in Korea so the employees won't even look at you if your not Korean. But all the other shop are very friendly.Worth the visit. Amazing. My kids enjoyed the place. Great time for exploration in the area.Visit the area.They sale a lot of clothing with self brand, the price is more expensive that some known brand like uniqlo, h&m etc...They mostly sell clothes and cosmetics here. This place is equivalent to those underground shopping centres in Seoul. It is a large space and you can try bargaining too. Close proximity to Dongmun Market and a gem of a historical area called Gwandeokjeong.Communication barrier is not a problem for us to shop here. Yes, they don't really speak English. But, we still had a good time to shop and bargain. If you want to shop korean fashion (but not the designer label or branded one), clothing, accessories, bags, cosmetic, skin care, this is the place. One place for everything so that you don't have to walk more. Innisfree, Nature Republic, The Saem, Skin Food, you name it. All are here.We enjoy shopping underground. We were able walk from one end to another. Just remember where you enter. There is a number so you will not get lost.There were beauty products, children clothing, adult clothing, bags, shoes, restaurants, etc. They are not your designer stuff but cheap items. Since winter, they sell winter wear. We bought some face masks, cleanser for less than $10. We also bought bags for $15. The lady said made in korea so we think ok. The backpack is great cos very spacous. Good for traveling. Quality is just ok. Then at one exit near to the wet market, we found a shop called bang bang. It belongs to a friend of the korean actor who starred in the famous korean drama ""my love from the star"" we were able to buy simple T shirts, socks. They are less than $10. Socks about $3. We actually shop here 2 times when we were staying in ocean suites hotel. It was just 10 to 15 minutes walk to this underground shopping area.There are restaurants here too. We found a good korean restaurant here. It was good food and affordable.Maybe coz it’s winter, mainly promoting winter clothes. Not many knick knacks to see or buy. Haven’t yet compared to shopping malls, but can’t say it’s very affordable eitherSince my hotel is located at one end of this shopping centre, I visited this place every day during my stay in Jeju. Being underground, it was great to shield the winter cold especially in the evenings.The shops essentially sell similar products - clothings, cosmetics, shoes, accessories, bags, hats, etc. There are few eateries and fast food chains too. This shopping street tends to be crowded in the evenings. There are free toilet facilities at one end, i.e. exit 1.good facility,many store and warm when winter season its the best place for shopping at Jeju.nearby to dongmun market and its easy to go by busIt's probably the best place to shop for street wear in Jeju but it's nothing compared to Seoul. After visiting this place, one realised how expensive jeju is compared to the mainland Korea.Free samples are given out when purchasing cosmetic in Seoul. Nothing of that sort in Jeju. Fashion spotted in this mall is old and pathetic. Don't get your hopes high.Only saving grace is this mall protects you from the weather elements during shopping. But so is any mall in Seoul too."

So I was disappointed by that.. maybe it’s a lot better during high tide....Another negative is you have to pay to use the SHOWERS.. 3000w for adult and 2000w child.... shower gel and shampoo is available... for a priceWater was very clear and sand was clean. There are some shops on the beach, and toilet facilities close by. Plenty of eating places around the area too. A nice beach to spent a day or just a little while. There are people firing fireworks at night. So if you happen to be there when that happen, you are in for some light show.My girlfriend and I went for a walk here and sat on a bench to watch the sun go down. It was a picturesque setting which we enjoyed. There are hundreds of little rock piles people have built which I recommend seeing. We were not there to swim but the water felt good on the feet!Shane & JillWe visited this beautiful beach as part of the Western Discovery Tour organized by Yeha Bus tours so we were only given a limited time to experience the beach. We visited during the early days of spring so it was still quite chilly. The views of the beach are undeniably breathtaking. Ten minutes is more than enough to get in those nice shots.We go to Hyeopjae beach whenever in Jeju, lovely sand, good safe swimming, great rocks to climb over, the grandkids love itOf the beaches we visited in Jeju, this one was disappointing. The ground sand is covered in matting (likely to prevent erosion) and the area seemed a little untidy.The beach is nice with a combination of sand and rock. Korean people use EVERY available inch of land. They pull their trailers and cars right to the edge of the beach and set up camp. Don’t understand why swimming wasn’t allowed. People were wading in the water."

대둔산자연휴양림,16건의<U+00A0>리뷰,충청남도 금산 진산면 대둔산로 6,3위(12곳의 금산 소재 관광지 중),"We went there on a sunny day with average humidity and it was marvelous. I recommend the cable car if you want to go to the stop be because the paths can be very steep. This is why the paths can be challenging to unfit or inexperienced hikers. I’m a sportive twenty-eight year old with experience in mountain hiking and I found the hiking challenging due to the steepness. However, the view on top pays off for all pains. And the restaurants are also reasonable. I recommend going to the one where the front women are NOT yell-advertising at you. These are usually the best.Quite an inaccessible place if you are traveling by public transport.The exhilarating part started after you alight from the cable car. There were many steel steps up. Beware if you are visiting during the wet season as it can be slippery. Not suitable for those who are afraid of heights, especially crossing the suspension bridge and climbing the Samseon Stairway. You can feel the slight sway and hear the squeaking sounds as you move across. There are 2 cafes up there after you cross the suspension bridge.Besides these, the view up there is great.A must visit/try: Cable Car, Cloud Bridge, Samseon Staircase and Peak!! Done all that, it's all worth it! Thou, they raised the price for the Cable Car, now 10,500 won two-ways and 7500 won one-way for adult. Did not enjoy much the ride because it was too crowded. We don't have vehicles so we took the bus to go to Daedunsan. We went to Jeonju. However, direct bus from Jeonju to Daedunsan is not available anymore (we don't know since when or until when, maybe seasonal). The best way to go by bus is through Daejeon Seonambu Terminal. Bus #34 have trips back and forth every 45-50minutes. The driver was so friendly to us. But, we have to walk about 20mins along the highway (with is quite dangerous, i guess) from the Bus Stop to the Main Entrance of Daedunsan. Only the Bus Trip we had was the downside, but the experince was helpful. The rest of our adventure at Daedunsan was fun, tiresome but worth it!!Park is located south southwest of the City of Daejeon. Fourth biggest city in Korea. I found the park to be less well developed than the national parks in Korea. But - for that same reason - refreshing and lovely. I have been there three times. And never found it crowded. Always peaceful, serene. I'm sure I'll visit again and stroll among the paths and trees, enjoying nature at its finest. Clean air (as clean as it gets in Korea) and in the spring, lovely flowers and smells.Once reach the top peak after the cable car ride. you can take alot of beautiful Instagram friendly photos but the crowd is super overcrowded and not a good time to visit. very tiring high stairway. won't not recommend to visit at this peak time.To get to the park from Jeonju there is a bus four times per day from the Jeonju Bus Terminal (departure times 06.40 - 09.40 - 14.20 - 15.50). The bus drops you at the bus terminal of the Park. The return buses leave at 9.00 - 11.40 - 13.00 - 17.10 and 18.25. The journey takes about 1hr15 min. and costs 6,400 one-way.I took the 06.40 bus, and discovered that although the Park opens at 8.00, all business are closed until 9.00. So I had to wait for my morning coffee until that time...!You have the choice taking the cable car, or hike up. If you can I recommend hiking up, which takes a good hour until the top cable car station. The trail is steep, on a bed of stones with hand rails on the side. It passes through beautiful nature, and when I was there it was very quiet. From there it is another 30 minutes climbing up to the top. Part of the climb is a steep steel ladder. The view from the top is great. On the way back I took the cable car (8,500 one-way). Took the 13.00 bus back.Very nice hike on a beautiful day!From Gao dong it took 3 of us an hour and a half, on the bus, to reach the restuarant and cafe at the base of the mountain. Because I am out of shape it took us about 3 hours to go up the mountain and 1 to come down. The mountain is massive, but a person in better shape might be able to cut the total time down by an hour. There were many elderly people walking up the mountain much faster than me. They also did not have a backpack. I chose to carry water, snacks, and a change of clothes - all of which I needed, but I am sure this slowed me down a bit. Along the way several people stopped to take breaks and drink Makgeolli (rice wine). The view from the bridge and stairs are amazing. Do not talk yourself out of the 70 degree angles stairs, like I almost did. It is well worth it and the way down is hidden and much easier. However, use caution if you have a health condition. Spend a day there. Start with breakfast at the cafe, climb and then have dinner at one of the 3 restuarants once you come down. I highly recommend going on a weekday; we went on a Wednesday mid-morning. There weren't even 30 people there; it was perfect.Mount Daedunsan is a natural reserve that had kept quite a low profile for all these years. But once you set your foot to the place, you cant help but admire and wonder on the creation of the world where you can view the mountains at a magnificient 180 degrees view. The journey to reach the peak can be tiresome for the weak and so not recommended for the elderly. But , if you are young and fit, do get your gears and climb up the 1 km steep staircase to reach to the top. The temperature can drop to about -4 degrees so do put on your heat tech gears."

At night the light up the place so you can still see the sea to some extentCame during mudfest and had a really nice time. There are several facilities along the way to grab snacks or drinks. View was nice and the summer is def worth a visit with or without the event.It’s a nice beach, I enjoyed my time there. I loved that you could rent tubes and float in the water. There was a lot of trash as the tide came in but that’s that same for most beaches. There wasn’t many rocks in the water which was good for my feet. The sunset there was beautiful.If you are visiting Korea especially for the first time then this is a must see Beach. There are just a few Beaches in Korea with fine white sand fro long stretches. This is one of them. It is located off Hwy 15 south of Seoul around a 3 hour drive. There are many great hotels either right on the Beach, or within a 2 minute walk. Mudrun plaza is where you will find the MudRun festival during the last weeks of July. This festival is a must see if you are a student or expat living in Korea. The festival lasts an entire week and draws half a million to million plus crowds. There is usually a large expat presence at this festival, and it is considered one of the best festivals in Korea. If you plan on going there, book your hotel room around April or May. If you cannot find a decent priced hotel, stay down the road at Muchanpo Beach. It is only a 10 minute drive from Boreyong South and the hotel prices are cheaper during the festival. Taxi fare from each beach is around 12,000 KRW ($11.00 USD) each way. Hotels are 20% to 30% cheaper than Boreyong, as it is less crowded and packed.Is this dangerous / suitable for 4 year old? Not sure if he might be scared. Is there a safety strap on the seat?We came here with the intention of trying out the Dacheon Rail Bike!! It is nice and the scenery is awesome as it’s oversees the Sea. A Tip, the ticketing counter opens at 9am when they issue you a number. At 10am sharp, they will call for the number and sells the tickets.Having a shrimp burger at the beach is also a nice thing to do!! For the night, we had great shells!!! It’s just awesome and keeps coming :)Enjoy guys!!West coast beach is the best. Stay nearby in motel etc and enjoy great seafood.Water is clean, beach wide with nice sand and lifeguards.Lots of young people around.I visited this beach while in town for the mud festival, a unique and recommended event if you find yourself nearby. Lots of delicious seafood restaurants (among others) line the beach.Nice if uninteresting beach tainted by the smell of the fish restaurants nearby and the fireworks ( poor ones ) at night.CY ( 2016.11.21 ) I and my wife visited this beach in vacation. Because of visiting November, so there was not many people and quiet. The seaview was not bad, and along beach line, there was many clam and sashimi restaurant. We were satisfied with winter beach and quiet atmosphere. There was good place to enjoy in summer, but there was good in winter, too."

The place is wide, and if the entrance is free there's few paid activities that you can do like archery or renting an handbok. When I went there was also few traditional games available for kids and adults to try for free and a market with both traditional products and food. A lot of kids are using this place to fly kite so overall it's a nice place to spend some time to relax, know more about history and have fun.Not so much to see inside but you can try archery you need to pay of course but not so expensive, very far from Seoul its in Chungcheungnamdo Province, peaceful place and very wide insideAlthough the fort has been rebuilt, it gives a good impression of how the different classes would have lived in South Korea, it is also a sacred place for especially local Catholic people as they were prosecuted and hanged at a tree in the fort itself.The stories and culture around this fortress are interesting, and the surrounding area free of tourists but with nice mountains, friendly town, rice paddies and old Buddhist temples.The grounds are beautiful & peaceful. Lovely area to walk & stretch your legs. There is an area with traditional games set up - perfect for all ages!Fortified area converted into a park, while maintaining the history. You will see old habits with information on one side and on the other people with kites.Beautiful after a fresh snowfall. Two blocks from the main bus stop. Lots of local restaurants. Some events during the year with ""guards"" in traditional dress. (summer)"
국립생태원,27건의<U+00A0>리뷰,충청남도 서천 마서면  금강로 1210 (우) 33657,1위(2곳의 서천 소재 야외 활동 중),"Front staffs was helpful and I could borrow wheelchair. The eco park was huge open field and had a dome building with five climate zone where I could see various flora and fauna. For the first time I saw desert fox and they were so cute. I think this place has interesting possibility to grow ripe well with good management and time.You can see various animals originally reside in different area - dessert, tropical area and etc. I strongly recommend this place to visit if you are a foreigner staying in Korea for months and don't know where to visit in KoreaCY ( 2015.12.29 ) I and my wife visited there for walking because I heard there was big place and good place to walking. I didn't expect but there had good place, ""Ecorium"". This Eco park was divided 5 section by climate. There was many tree and animal for exhibition, that was good. There was up to the mark, I think.I recently spent a wonderful afternoon exploring the entire Ecoplex and left feeling pretty inspired.The biodomes are fantastic, both to look at from a distance and to explore inside. The emphasis is more on flora than fauna which will appeal to those who appreciate not seeing cage after cage of miserable zoo displays. There are a few animals around though - mainly fish and reptiles but a few mammals along the way too. And a few hyperactive penguins in the polar display.Almost all the interp panels are in Korean, though with English taglines. Anyone with a basic grasp of ecology will be able to figure out what is being conveyed, and if not, the gardens are worth a wander anyway. I thoroughly enjoyed the expansive grounds beyond the biodomes -- plenty of interesting plant and birdlife abounds in the wetlands. There's also a cool eco-themed playground for the little ones.Well worth a visit if you are passing through this part of Korea, and incredible value at 5,000 won/adult, (approx US$5) - less for kids."
외암민속마을,66건의<U+00A0>리뷰,"충청남도 아산 Oeam-ri, Songak-myeon (우) 336-921",2위(18곳의 아산 소재 관광지 중),"We loved our experience, able to entertain our teenagers with chestnut roasting, rice cultivating and just exploring around the village with kind and nice people teaching us about the Korean culture in different locations. Play place made of rice and local materials and a nice outdoor cafe with traditional food for a reasonable price.A great place to learn about Korean culture. Affordable entrance. The day we visited they had traditional musical performances that caught the attention of my kids. After that, we walked around the village. As you walk you can learn about the houses and important people that lived in them. You can have traditional food and nice coffee as well.I always enjoy walking around Oeam Folk Village. It's such a peaceful place. Spring is especially nice when the kanadi and chindalae are in bloom. I've enjoyed a few picnics here, a great place for them.I decided to visit this place thinking that it would be less commercial since it is still waiting for UNESCO status. Disappointed because the guided tour wasn't informative, despite asking questions to prob deeper. Of the 6 ""workshops"" listed, only the candy making and lantern making ones were available. Went for the half hour candy making ""workshop which ended within 10 mins. No explanation on the history or process. We were each given a lump of sugar to pull and that was it. Wasn't worth our 2 over hour car trip.It was a nice little traditional village. I like the scenary and the country feeling, because the mountain is close by. It is outside of the city, so it was nice to feel like you were with nature. I like it. There are also shops and things to do and see here too.I was taken to the Oeam Folk Village by my Korean colleagues. It was very interesting and nicely done. There are traditional Korean buildings as well as gorgeous flowers. The village is part tourist destination and part residence. Enjoy the cinnamon ginger drink and eat in the small restaurant. The kimchi pancake was one of the best things I have eaten.It was a really nice and different experience for me to see Korean Culture and how they live at old times.. i recommend there to visit to see the old and valuable culture.. and to be honest it was nice walking..Actually, I've been here twice, once in 2004 and again last month! Spring and fall are the best times, of course, though it was not too cold in February. We were able to visit a number of the older houses and see how they were constructed. We were also invited to taste locally-made liquor. This is a lovely excursion and a way to see the past together with the present in Korea.An interesting visit. Located about an hour south of Seoul (depending on traffic), this folk village is surrounded by mountains in the Asan region. The village is in the middle of farm land with people working/living in the village. Smaller than the Korean Folk Village (한국민속촌) near Suwon but I think this is better.Here is a good place to experience for old korean village. You can do homestay.
Also there are several korean restaurant. So, you can taste korean traditional dish(food) in the village house."

Using the audio guide, you can hear about almost every artifact in the collection, spanning seven exhibition halls. Additionally, you can walk or take a cart around the campus to see various memorials and observation areas. The Path of Maple Trees is a beautiful walk that encompasses the entire campus. You would have to spend an entire day here to see everything, but the pamphlet offers suggestions of the tours: History/Education Tour or Memorial Tour in Nature are approx 3 hours each or the Patriotic Poems and Quotations Tour is approx 2 hours.Pretty cool with a lot of impressive statues... worth seeing in Cheonan. Feeding the fish was interesting tooThis is the place where the local Korean middle/high schools add in their yearly school trip. The exhibitions are well organised and easy to follow. Recommend to those who wish to know the overall history of Korea!The grounds are beautiful. The exhibits are very detailed and help you understand what happened when Japan tried to take overThis location is far from Cheonan but really must be visit!!! It was built in huge area so you have to arrange your time like a day. You can learn everything about Korean culture and civilization..Moreover you can enjoy with your family for walk around and sightseeing. All season is great to visit there.! But especially autumn and spring are gorgeous. Weekends are really crowded so my opinion choose weekday if you have a time.You can reach this place from Cheonan bus terminal by local bus (381, 382, 383, 390, 391, 400, 402). Entrance is free but if you come here with your car you have to pay for parking fee 2000 won.It is far from the city but it worth to visit. You can enjoin the stamp in each building you went. All the history from the start until now you can learn from this hall.This is an excellent place to enjoy with family and learn South Korean history. We stumbled upon this place while our visit to nearby Daemyeong resort in Cheonan. It’s only 2000 KRW to park and entry is free. There’s information center where you can information about the Independence Hall and exhibition. We were able to rent a baby stroller for free for our visit and enjoyed our visit. They have activities for kids including a train ride across the park. There are 8 exhibit halls with different theme of Korean history and takes 1.5-2 hours to go through all. There’s a quite a bit of walking throughout the visit, so better to wear comfortable shoes. Ample places to enjoy food, ice cream and Korean snacks...overall we had a fun day in early Spring....I went to this history museum about an hour south of Seoul with my Korean relatives. It is on a large track of land with many separate halls and a 4D theater that the kids might like. Each hall was filled with different eras in Korean history, but most concentrated with the Japanese occupation era from the late 1800s to 1945. It was great to see all the set ups as you walked in and out of displays (ALL areas included English explanations). Did not pay a thing for the visit, except for the parking.The grounds are large and impressive and there are many exhibits about Korea's history and struggle for independence.Perhaps predictably (considering the name), some parts are strongly nationalistic, maybe even biased. One exhibit has a video that explicitly claims Japan and China have 'distorted' Korea's history. Most exhibits are well described in English. Well worth a visit to get a Korean perspective on Korea's history.It’s a big place and there are 6 buildings to see in. I’m not sure there is a guide for foreigner but I recommend this place to see around and learn about Korea."

I say morning because it would be unwise to wait until later when people start coming in by droves. Bus loads of Koreans descend on this place to do their hiking; and they take hiking very seriously!The mountains and the lake are pretty and reminds me of my home state of Virginia. The walk around one side of the lake is about 4 KM and most of the path is boardwalk. There is a boat you can take back to the starting point versus walking back the same way which is very nice. Cost is about W4,000/person.There are souvenir shops and restaurants available as well. It's a worthwhile trip and glad we did it! I rated it 4 (Very Good) instead of 5 simply due to the large numbers of people to deal with."

It was well costed and interesting. They also have a family of otters and Chipmunks. Upstarts is a history instillation on fishing from the Namhangang River. It is centrally located in the city and easily accessable.They say this is the biggest freshwater aquarium in Korea. It has many kinds of freshwater fishes, creatures, reptiles and amphibians. There's a fishing history museum. And the end of the route is otters. So, if you arrive late, try not to miss the highlight at the end.I really enjoyed watching them. Not a waste of money.- The entrance fee was 10,000 won and I had a special discount of 25% for Visit Danyang Week.- There was a staff inside who provided me a free guided tour with an explanation. Only in Korean.- There's a fishbowl for experiencing with hands. Only for certain kinds.- The gigantic fishbowl for big fishes was incredible. Not at the level of expectation.While the aquarium definitely caters to children, there is plenty to see for visitors of all ages. There was a good selection of marine life native to Korea (many of them being on the endangered list) although most of them were in fish tanks barely large enough for them to move in. The reptile/amphibian section also had a good variety of rare species but again, the tanks they were confined to were suffocatingly small. Like most well known aquariums there are couple of huge tanks and there is enough to see for an hour.A nice little spot, oddly situated in a small town, not sure who visits here mostly, but it is well presented and mostly with freshwater fish, which amazed me how many types there are!!!Our bus from Seoul (east Seoul bus terminal) dropped us off right next to the aquarium which ended up being very convenient. We found free lockers, bathrooms and a tourist info counter that gave us the schedule for guinsa temple buses. We didn't visit the aquarium, but I thought this would be useful info. So here it is."

The wife rock turns her back to the husband rock because he married with another woman to have a son. That's it story Anyways, the scenery here is nice. It's good to take a walk around here and feel the fresh atmosphere. There's also musical fountain at night. There are some convenient stores here.Was able to go with a friend who had a car, so I’m not sure about public transit. It was a nice view. Day was clear so we had good views. Stopped to have coffee afterwards. The area is nice. Worth a stop. Up the walk is also Seongmun. Worth the hike up and down the stairs.If you are in the area it is worth a quick look.Its not far from the town center and free to enter unless you have a car which you will pay a small fee.There are tourist shops and cafes.Plenty of photo spots.We walked here from Danyang and we found it a little disappointing as you can see by the photos that the river was low and the peaks were more or less joined together. The first peak had a small building on it but we could not make out if it was a shrine, rest area or something else. It takes about 45 minutes to walk from townThis is a scenic three high rocks on a lake. There's a tiny pavilion on the middle rock.It is famous in the history and lots of tourists come to watch.When the people come to see, the weather makes many different views which means it is worthy of visiting multiple times. Especially, when there's no wind, the surface of the water becomes a mirror.- There's a lookaround tour with a ferry. It seemed expensive.- It can be watched along the passage with different angles.- There's a way to Seokmun(stone gate or rock gate in English) nearby. It is also one of 'Danyang Palgyeong(Eight Wonders of Danyang)'.This was a planned visit after reading about these rocks in Bird's book from 1897, recommended as a Korea primer. A lot has changed in Korea but these three rocks in the Hangang River remain. Sight is marred a bit by noisy speedboat rides and a huge mining operation in the background but worth the dive off the expressway.A picturesque rock formation sticking out of the Namhan River. About three kilometers outside of the town center, it is a comfortable 30 minute walk with wide pedestrian path leading to it. It’s one of those seen-in-done-it sights but definitely worth checking out for its postcard image.You can see 3 big rocks in the middle of the lake. The story is about a general watching over a peak in one of the rocks.A nice place to spend about 1 hour. Parking is not free but quite cheap. You can enjoy looking at the rocks/scenery and even take a short boat ride around the rocks if they are operating. From the car park you can also take a short 10 min walk up the cliff to see the stone gate.My only complaint would be that you will stuggle to get any picture without a bridge or something it it. It is a place of natural beauty but quite heavily surrounded by man made constructions.A nice spot for a break and a well earned rest from driving. Quite pleasant and good for scenic shots. Well worth the walk to the stone gate, sadly like everythigpng in Korea, it involves a lot of steps....lolPleanty of restaurants and a watermusic show is available in the warmer months."
구인사,70건의<U+00A0>리뷰,충청북도 단양 영춘면 백자리 132-1,1위(66곳의 단양 소재 관광지 중),"Guinsa is a very beautiful yet unique temple. It feels like a fusion of old and new, and has a very well known temple stay program. This temple is an incline up and through a valley with great views, so if you have any difficulty with inclines or stairs I’d not recommend it. I did see people with kids, they were with their parents and well behaved (it is a place of worship). At the “top” you will enter a big building that has 2 elevators to the left. Take the elevator to the 7th floor and it will bring you to the very top of the building complex. Above that there is an additional trail you can take if you wish to the burial site of a famous monk (but beware, more stairs). If you can, don’t miss out on experiencing the a meal as the monks take great pride in this giving and work hard on it year round! The food is vegetarian (and don’t take more than you can eat, very important to empty your plate). Great experience overall :)Took a bus from Danyang bus terminal that went straight to the bottom of the temple. (3,500 won) there's a slope that leads you up to the temple. The main temple hall is the last one, behind a modern looking temple hall with an air conditioned 1st floor. There's also a trail that leads you up to the grave of a famous monk. The trail has plenty of steps and took me about 30min. The lunch service starts at 11.30am, pretty decent vegetarian food. Do take note you have to finish the food on your plate as to prevent food wastage.One of the best views from the main plaza (at the top) in all of Korea. But you will work for it! Our guide told us that it's one of the newer temples because they are adding on all the time. Beautiful architecture. At the bottom of the hill there are shops and places to eat. Don't forget to visit the Buddhist museum as well. A must see.I was lucky enough to have a friend drive me up to the temple. We parked and took a shuttle part way up. You will have a hike the rest of the way to the temple and up through the grounds. It is all on an incline. The grounds are beautiful and of you made it up you should go all the way to the top. You will have to hike back down. There is a shuttle bus from Danyang. If you go to the tourist office in Danyang, the gentleman is very helpful and speaks English. He will give you a bus schedule.I’ve been to many temples in Korea. Most of them start to look the same. However this one felt like it was in another country. It felt like a scene from a movie set in Nepal or India. I drove there, and parking was 3,000won. But I saw there was a bus terminal which would cut out most of the walking which is not too different but it is straight up with few flat parts. It was a good trip. I’d recommend going at lunch or dinner time as meals I heard were free. All vegetarian. Lunch is 11:30- 14:00 if I remember correctly and dinner starts at 17:30 If you do visit here try to make sure to add other attractions in the town to visit as this will be maybe 1 or 2 hours at most.We took the express bus from Danyang (3000 Won - buy the ticket in the bus station next to the bridge- get the timetable from the tourist office on the Gosu cave side of the bridge). The ride to the temple was good - following and crossing the river. The express bus stops at the bottom of the temple slope (closer to the temple than the main car park). Its quite a steep climb but there's plenty of interest to look at while you catch your breath - just keep going up the slope. You can pick up a small brochure on the different buildings on the way up. The Daejosajeon (at the top) is fantastic with a very high roof interior and sitting in a large square with a view down to the other buildings.We walked back down to the main car park (where the temple museum is) and walked on about 3km downhill to visit Ondal tourist park (through Guinsa carpark, downhill towards Yeongchun at a turn-off to the left you can see a green arch which is the entrance to the park). The park is a film set which is good fun - you can sit on the emperors throne and go in some of the houses, but the main attraction is the cave - less spectacular than Gosu, but with some small passages and (when we went) lots of water dripping down - they give you a hard hat. You can get the local bus back by going out of the entrance and crossing the road. The timetable is up in the bus stop.Before we came to Korea we planned on visiting this marvelous temple complex that is situated in a valley between two mountain ranges. The bus leaves regularly from Danyang bus terminal and takes about 30 minutes. From the car park the road/path winds its way uphill and believe me it is quite a climb to the top of the complex. There are probably about 50 buildings including the Temple Homestay, the Great Teachers Hall, the four Heavenly Kings Gate with the statues of the four kings. We enjoyed a free lunch which tasted surprisingly good. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served to all visitors and two nuns were standing by the path ushering everyone in. There is a donation box to drop a few notes in. The religion here is a branch of Buddhism that disappeared for 500 years. In the mid 20th century a Korean monk called Taegakkuksu Euicheon built a three room native temple and ten years later work started on the buildings you see today. It is an enormous complex and you must not miss this during your travels.The famous monk died some years ago and his grave is at the top of the mountain and from the Great Teachers hall there is a trail on the right that lads to this wonderful spot. It takes about 45 minutes and there are over 800 steps in the way up.The kitchen can serve up to 40,000 meals a day.Do not forget to reach the top to see the main plaza and temple This place is a must see and certainly the only temple I would consider of I wanted to stay overnightamazing temple located up in the hills which were constructed such that nature is preserved without causing much disruption as possible. Amazing view at the top of most highest situated building. feel at aw-ed at the beauty of the place, both the temple building as well as the nature surrounding it. need to walk up to the temple for about 20 minutes. some with steeper slopes but the road is easy to walk for a fit and healthy individual. the view in autumn was just breathtaking!This is the headquarters of Cheontaejong(one branch of Korean Buddhism) having huge buildings in the forest. Great place to visit if you're looking for a peace.- 20~30 km away from the center of Danyang. Probably further than most other sites to visit.- Quiet and peaceful. I saw almost no tourists when I visited.- The buildings are huge. But, not that many. The area didn't feel not so large because buildings are incredibly big.- The most beautiful hall is the main hall on top of the hill.- It's a continuous hill from the entrance to the main hall. But, really easy comparing to other experiences in Danyang.- The harmony with autumn foliage is so scenic in October.- They provide free meals for visitors. And a temple stay is also available.- At the bus stop which is almost like a bus terminal, there's a bus to Seoul. Travelers may set this site as the last destination in Danyang."

Eungcheonggak, Hanbyeongnu Pavilion, and handful of Goryeo and Joseon era structures are the highlights of the complex. A small section of a fortress wall at the top of the complex provides some great views of Chungjuho Lake and the Cheongpung Cultural Heritage Complex. We were a week or two away from the fall colors reaching their brightest but the area was still colorful enough to make the trip worthwhile. The two museums housing the artifacts seem to have been neglected without much explanations and displays that looked to have been put together without much effort.Very korean. You'll know some things about Korea's history. Very scenic, big and beautiful. A must see if you love culture and nature.At first, the idea of random cultural complex out of nowhere really didn't appeal to me. But I would say this place is totally worth visiting if you are visiting Jecheon. The thing to check out is the last stop in the attraction where you can have amazing view of the lake and surrounding mountains. I loved the view from the top. Amazing. Beautiful view. Don't get turned off by some animal figures near the entrance. Keep moving on the map!If you have spare time when visiting Seoul, there is a place in Jecheon city that you can go to. Jecheon from Seoul Station is about two-hour train ride. I would recommend Cheongpung though the transportation is a bit hard going to this place after alighting at Jecheon Station. There is a bus going to there but the frequency is very far and between.The place itself is a combination beauty of nature and culture into one, and you can hike to the top of the hill to see the bridge and traditional houses. The view is breathtaking when I went there when it was autumn. Some say that's the best season to visit South Korea.It was raining when we got here, we walked the path leading to the model houses of the past centuries of Korea. We were also educated by our tour guide on how was life during those times which was pretty much the same anywhere in the world, except the knowledge on how they cope with the cold weather and what they do to seal their houses. It was a nice place for photo op.Nice that there were people selling some food items outside, like water chestnut and mushrooms.Good to see korean traditional houses. The setting is very good with the lake around. Unfortunately it was raining so we couldn't do the monorail which is supposed to give an excellent view of the entire valley.I visited here while it was raining and it was a great experience. The pavillion at the top has a priceless view and the flags at the top makes you feel like its a small fortress. Do not forget to follow the way going down and take a boat on the lake! Its beautiful :))The place is big, and has a multitude of buildings that range from the simple farmers houses to nobility dancing ball pavillions. The view across the lake below is fantastic, and if you time the visit to see the dancing water jet you get an extra benefit. At our time there were shows at least at 1100 and 1330, lasting about 20 min.There is some walking involved in getting to the top of the mountain. There were salesmen of ""real root beer"" and rosted chestnuts + many roots and grasses at the parking lot."

After half hr you reach the bus parking area ( no possible to go by car : no parking are for car) and you find a BIG queue that are waiting the bus. The first visit suggested is to enter the main building and look at some historical museum. Here you can get for free a motto on a paper with old writers characters. Then you can choose different path and different duration. The time I was there all the trees were changing colours so was amazing. Along the path you will find statues of previous presidents of Korea. It is worthwhile to visit. Interesting place to go and spend a morning. Long queue to go in and out from the bus.... bur it's valuable time....CY ( 17.12.05 ) This place was the president's vacation home before. So there had beautiful view and various facility. There was a bigger place than I think, and we enjoyed vacation home that was operating as museum. We went the observatory on the mountain, that's excellent and must go.CheongNamDae is the Korean President's Summer Villa Home. Kind of like a timeshare I guess since when they aren't there, touring is allowed. The home is like any other vacation home you've seen before. Very typical two-story and spacious. It looks comfortable and homey, paying a suitable tribute to the name of a presidential retreat.I was surprised that I was able to step inside and tour the rooms too but no photography was allowed once in the villa. And it's funny because they give you disposable shoes for inside the house for cleanliness and order, so that was interesting. But it felt very open house-ish (for real estate) for my tastes so I didn't linger too much on the house tour.I actually had much more fun touring the grounds outside. I got to see the vast koi ponds, beautiful bamboo forest (my favorite), and many trail-like grounds. It felt like a very clean and well-organized park. I was able to leisurely stroll about and it felt really nice. It's extremely quiet and calming here. So if you're more into landscape than interior design, I suggest spending the majority of your time touring the grounds than inside the villa. Enjoy!Beautiful gardens around it. Very quiet place. Perfect for vacation. You have to change shoes to get in. No picture or food allowed inside the house. Nice visit overall.This was a presidential summer house in the past, Now it is open to the public as a park. You can walk around there as if you are President of the ROK.This place was South Korean president villa and now it is opened to public. It has beautiful nature especially in spring and autumn and quiet and calm to relax. This large place has beautiful flowers, trees, river and buildings. We stayed here about 3 hours and nearby here there are great restaurants with fantastic taste. I ate in the restaurant Majung and so much satisfied. This restaurant has only one menu which is course menu, you can taste various food which is extremely tasteful and has a lot of portion. Chungpungmyungga is another famous restaurant and very close to Majung. One of the best restaurants in Korea. Only demerit is hard to reach by public transportation. If you can drive a car, this place is definitely worth a visit. This place is one of my favorite place in South Korea.This is not actually in Cheongju. It's about an hour outside of the city by express bus. The house was cool, but it wasn't anything to rave over. The walking trails aren't worth the time, except for one that you take up hundreds of stairs! The view from the top is absolutely amazing!!! It's an intense climb up, though! Grab a bottle of water beforehand!"

It only took us about 30 minutes to walk, but we spent at least that long taking pictures and enjoying the scenery. The main gate was absolutely stunning with the vibrant colors of the ceiling offset with the granite fortress wall, green foliage and the views of the city below.beautiful fortress, with very lovely view, it was nice to wallk very early in the morning with the morning mist and fog, then the sun cam out. not for those with limited physical capabilities, but well worth walking the walls , at a slow pace.There is only one bus which is bus number 862-2 that running every 25 minutes from Cheongju Gymnasium to Sangdang Sanseong. Sangdang Sanseong is the last stop and along the way the bus also brings us to other tourist attractions in Cheongju for example Cheongju National Museum. There are Korean restaurants operated by locals in the main gate near the bus stop. The hiking trail itself is not so steep, you can see the city of Cheongju from top of the hill. Even if you are not in the mood of hiking, you can just bring your mattress and tent and enjoy the view from the slope of the hill since they also provide camping area. There is also a small lake across the village. You will find that most of visitors are senior citizens who come usually with their hiking groups. Since there is only one bus and it is depart every 25 minutes, you should line up with others and be prepared to stand all the way to your destinations since its always full.Sangdangsanseong Fortress was a popular spot for locals as a hiking spot and with a huge open field near the fortress entrance. While nowhere as scenic as the better known fortress walls in Suwon or Seoul, the fortress makes for a pleasant hike for a few kilometers in a peaceful surroundings. Several restaurants in a lakeside area awaits hikers who come back down after the hike.Sanddangsanseong is a fortress outside of Cheongju. It's a great hike with wonderful views. At the bottom there is a small village where you can get some delicious food and/or coffee and tea. It's especially great in the Fall when the leaves are changing. Definitely recommend if you're in Cheongju.You can hike around the fortress wall and enjoy wonderful views on a clear day. There are many places for a picnic, or if you want to enjoy traditional food, you will find some very quaint eateries offering very authentic home- style Korean food.You can hike around the fortress walls and enjoy wonderful views on a clear, sunny day. The hike around the walls takes around an hour and a half and afterwards you can enjoy traditional food in one of several restaurants.We took a bus from Inter-City Bus Terminal (one transfer) arrived. It was quite easy to get there, just get some information from the Tourist Information Center near the Bus Terminal. It was a Sunday and the place was bustling, but not over crowded, with locals (yes, no tourist). We took the clockwise hike around the fortress wall. There were various great views of the city along the way. We were greeted by friendly locals who were doing their hike. The hike was moderately easy and a good warm up for our more tedious trek the following day (Songnisan).There were a number of eateries there, the locals ate there. We did not patronize any as we packed our own lunch (Gimbaps) and sat by the pond to eat after our hike.Great place to visit, even if you have children, it is an easy hike.This is a hike in some sense. The locals go here for exercise, you will see them in gear and with walking poles. Why not follow suit? Take your camera for the best views of the city! Take some water and wear sensible walking shoes. Walk up toward the fortress entrance (get out of the taxi at the visitor center, two buildings with snacks and a nice attendant who gives out maps, get one. Walk up the field and along the path to the gate, you can circle the whole interior of the village by walking the wall. Go left first to see the view, then walk on for the long path, OR turn back and go right from the gate to the village. This has s pond, coffee, and traditional food tents. Catch the bus back, it goes in a circle then back to Cheongju."

It's small but very well signed in English. Korea beat Gutenberg to movable metal type by 70+ years, but hardly anyone is aware of that feat. The method of casting type/fonts is unique and differs from the western approach of molds. The staff members--particularly a young man in security office--were very helpful. He kept our luggage for us while we toured, and then he graciously called a taxi for us and went out in the snow to ensure we got away efficiently. It's very nice that it is free.Cheongju Early Printing Museum which houses the metal movable types for the Buddhist scripture Jikji, printed in 1377. The rest of the museum has displays with detailed explanations of the publishing process of Jikji along with some old Korean printing woodblocks and movable types from the Goryeo and Joseon era. A small display had a section of world history of printing. The content of the museum is about as exciting as what you’d expect a museum about printing would be but it’s free and makes a decent stop on the way to another sight. The grounds of Heungdeoksa Temple (where Jikji was printed) are adjacent to the museum.If you come to Cheongju as a tourist it's one of the places you're going to want to visit. It is average at best but has there's no a lot to do in the city it's worth the stop. Although I wouldn't make the trip from another city here to see it.You can see diaramas of the making and use of the earliest moveable metal type that predates western printing by around 200 years. Koreans invented this metal typeset in the 13th century. The jikji is the earliest printed publication. Interesting and worth a visit if you are a book loverWe visited the Early Printing Museum and we're delighted at the quality of the exhibitions once we got past the animatronic display. The actual exhibitions are a comprehensive look at printing history and techniques which were based upon the UNESCO Memory of the World book Jikji, which was printed with metal type about 80 years before Gutenberg. There was a great display just about how the book was created (the actual book is in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris). I would have liked more information on the book's contents and what it actually says.The museum is actually the centrepiece of a printing precinct that includes a park, the site of the temple where the Jikji was printed, numerous monuments a Metal type centre where they cast metal type using traditional methods(as a presentation for school groups), another Museum of Modern and Contemporary Printing (which isn't very well signposted) and some great shops (the ink and paper store is a highlight).Every second September they also host the international Jikji Festival, which is spectacular and brings out the whole community with displays, lots of food, performances, talks and a contemporary art exhibition.I thought I could get to know more about the ancient printing technique....but only found the whole place is full of replicas and some crappy mannequins...so disappointedThe early printing museum is a great rainy afternoon activity. There is English labels on most exhibits and they have the oldest movable style printing press of a book that is still in print. It's interesting and free.Reasonably interesting, but probably not one that will thrill kids. It's well maintained, but the film at the beginning, as the other reviewers have mentioned, is probably the most interesting bit, and for all the wrong reasons. It was entirely empty when I went.This is said to be one of the main attractions in Cheongju. The home of a printing press before Europeans. Park like grounds. Not a lot to see but if you are in town any way. Many languages accomodated.The Good:- Free admission- Exhibits are quite comprehensive and well organised. (Detailed explanations on the printing techniques developed from each dynasty were given)- Beautiful museum compoundThe Bad:- Nationalistic. As some of the reviewers have mentioned, the exhibits are curated in a way to portray the superiority of the Korean paper making technology and downplay the significance of other civilizations.- ""Easy to get to, but a little out of the way."": The bus stop to catch the bus to the museum is opposite the Cheongju Intercity Bus Terminal, but you'll need to take a 30 minutes bus ride to view a museum which can be covered in less than an hour. To get to the museum, take bus 831 from the bus stop opposite Cheongju Intercity Bus Terminal and stop at Cheongju Arts Center (예술의전당). Cross the road and you'll reach the museum. To get back, take bus 832 from the same side of the road as the museum.*There's no English announcements on the buses in Cheongju so you have to be alert (Get off once the bus passes a yellow-green overhead bridge)."
