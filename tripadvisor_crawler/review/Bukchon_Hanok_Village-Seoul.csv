Nice walk,We had a couple of hours and we went there Hanok village for a relaxing stroll. We were not disappointed! The old houses are super well maintained and the view of the city's skyline mixed with the old houses was breathtaking!
Quieter part of Seoul.,"Spent only 20-25 mins strolling around the traditional village area, but ended up spending another couple of hours enjoying few roads that has all small art shops that houses very pretty range of artwork, postcards, souvenirs, paintings and more! Prepare your cash! The neighbourhood is very peaceful, walk slow and enjoy your quiet time here."
Worth it,We spent two hours and took lots of pictures. One day it will disappear. A very pictoresque area. A purely walking area.
Worth a few minutes walk through.,"If there you must go up the hill. We followed the signs to the Observatory, but never made it the whole way.Disappointed in that we had hired a private guide to show us all over Seoul, but because there is no place to park near the 'village' (which is practically downtown), he just dropped us off for 30 minutes on our own with a designated pick-up spot."
Nice to see a bit of preserved history,"I liked walking around this village and soaking up the cute architecture, but also the idea that these little walkways have been walked up & down for many many years. Get up to an elevated spot and clock roof after roof in the old style - nice!"
"Lots of walking and stairs, great view at the top.","You can walk here after visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace and have lunch is one of the many small restaurants. There is a lot of walking on hilly streets and stairs. It is not all original, most buildings have been renovated or are new construction but still with the same style as the old ones. This is a residential area so cars are allowed and the residents stand outside with signs asking visitors to be quiet. There are lots of shops and restaurants"
Nice,Had a nice walk here. Full of shops and tea houses. Some sold traditional handcrafted items. Would recommend it. 
Crowded but interesting.,This is a residential neighborhood of very old homes. The houses are not open to the public but the streets (many very steep streets) are interesting to roam about (quietly because people actually live here). Great for photographers. Many visitors rent Hanbok costumes and pose for photos. Lots of little shops and places to eat along the way. Streets can be crowded on weekends.
Beautiful from a distant ,"as this is still an actual residential area the inside of the house can’t be seen, but it is the interior + exteriors that makes the Hanok ever interesting ... fine other hanok villages that allow you to have a meal in it I.e onion cafe "
Should visit but will probably not revisit ,"The taxi ride from our hotel in Gangnam-gu to Bukchon Hanok was 32000 won. What makes it worse was that the Naver Map direction didn't bring us to the correct spot. We were left at the end of the street near a park and had to walk for 20 minutes looking for the old village. Well not exactly old. Its a residential area with old houses and people still live in it. Snap some pictures and good to go. One of the checklist. And oh yeah, decent amount of climbing needed especially when with kids "
Quaint Village - Go Early!,"I wish I had read the prior review before wandering over to Bukchon Village. I have been to the neighborhood independently (not part of a tour group) a few times and it is lovely however, very crowded. The area is located very near Insadong, Gyeongbokgung Palace, and Changdeokgung Palace so a combined visit is absolutely possible. You can get a little map of the area that slows ""8 views of Bukchon Village"" which is a nice guide for a non-guided tour visit. Walking through just to enjoy the small homes, stores, and tea shops is also possible and enjoyable. The major downside to visiting this area is the hordes of tourists dressed in Hanbok trying to take the perfect picture down the quaint alleyways - difficult to just enjoy when you are trying to dodge disrupting their photoshoot."
Not what we were expecting,"Visited with my family on Sunday morning.Perhaps our expectations were unrealistic (was expecting a real old town/visit to the past experience), there were signs all over asking visitors to behave (talk with lower voice, not get in, not peeing, etc.); to me is just a nice residential area where the people living there seem to be annoyed by all the tourists.Took a few pictures and headed to Insadong, that was more fun than this."
Early morning visit was perfect time,"We visited early before people were up and loved walking the quiet streets.It was magical.But by the time we left, hoards of tourists were arriving .The neighborhood is a major tourist attraction,so if you want to capture the magic,go early."
Long walk but what a view!,"You'll need your walking shoes to get up there. Steep narrow roads but for those who love Korean architecture, this is a must see. Fantastic view of Seoul skyline from the top of the hill too. Breathtaking. Got to keep your voice down though because there are people living in the houses."
Must visit for tourists,"Its a long alley filled with Korean traditional houses. It just gets crowded with tourists. As i know, there are still people living in them so visitors are discouraged to make too much noise. I didnt go walk further because there were too many people."
The Past Retained,"Located between the Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgong Palaces and just a short walk from the Anguk Metro Station you will find a little section of old Seoul retained. It is a mix of old and new, traditional and tacky but it is very interesting. Take the walk from Exit 3 from the station and walk up the hill . The place is well-signed and maps are available of the area showing the preferred walk. It is about a 3 KM walk and some points give good views of the city and the old buildings with their tiled roofs."
Neighborhood With Many Traditional Houses,"Bukchon Hanok Village, in a Northern hilly area of Seoul, is my favorite neighborhood in the city because of its distinctive traditional architecture, known as hanok. Boasting several hundred of these homes, it has the largest number that still remain in the metropolis. On my most recent visit to Seoul, I took a friend here to introduce her to this earlier-era style that relies on natural materials. The one-story, tile-roof houses with patterned walls, first designed and built in the 14th century, feature an interlocking framework of uwooden beams that rest on blocks of stone. Other elements often used include earth, clay, straw and paper made from mulberry bark. The traditional courtyard garden remains hidden from the street.We stopped first at Bukchon Tourist Information before the village for free maps and brochures. The man working there spoke excellent English and proved to be most helpful. But we did not go there directly. Instead, we stood looking confused about where to go at a crossroads and were approached by a mobile tourist information rep. Dressed in a red jacket and red hat, he was in the area to offer assistance to tourists, armed with English, Japanese and Chinese language skills. I have never witnessed this service in other cities worldwide. These reps can be seen throughout popular tourist destinations in Seoul and have steered me in the right direction more than once.As we ascended the hill, the hanoks suddenly appeared and the modern city had been left behind. Many of the houses have been turned into tea houses, restaurants and workshops, but there are still private residences galore. Two women in yellow hats and yellow vests with “Please be Quiet” in English, Japanese and Chinese emblazoned on the front and back walked along the narrow alleys, often putting an index finger to closed lips. I also noted a poster on one wall, requesting visitors to be quiet. It appears that the residents would like less noise in their neighborhood.We arrived here in midday and it was like tourist central. Despite efforts to keep noise down, many visitors could have cared less. One even noticed a gate ajar and rushed into the courtyard of a private home to take a photo. But there were plenty of photo ops along the alleys and at the top of the hill, where a stunning view of Seoul could be captured. We headed off to more quiet streets to simply soak in the atmosphere. In the past, I have gone here in early morning and the whole area was naturally quiet.Bukchon Hanok Village can be reached by subway line 3, Anguk stop. Take exit 2 or 3 and follow the directional signs."
Nice traditional architecture in the middle of a bustling city,"When we visit anywhere new, I always like to have some historical places to visit as well as seeing how local life is at present. Having seen lots of castles and shrines already, a traditional village, where people still live, sounded like an interesting place.It really was beautiful, and in some places, the contrast with these ancient homes ith th buildings of modern Seoul in the distance showed how the city has changed. There were several girls walking about in traditional hanbok costumes, and that enhanced the feeling that this probably had looked the same hundreds of years ago. All of that, I liked. A lot.But, if you head to Seoul, or anywhere in Asia in the summer, it's going to be hot. Because it's hot, it's not the peak tourist season, but that doesn't mean that tourists aren't out in force. Just like us, hundreds of others decided to come here mid-afternoon; it was very crowded. In order to get decent photos of the architecture, etc.. you have to be pretty creative in angling your shots, or at the very minimum, wait it out for enough people to walk by so you can get a picture.I would guess that this is pretty typical no matter what time of year you're here, so if I were going to go back, I would head there first thing in the morning, when the residents are about the only people you'll see in the streets."
A cultural village,A beautiful little village portraying Korean's culture and modernism. Wear hanbok to take exquisite pictures.
Love the surrounding,Its a very pretty housing complex to walk in small alley. The houses are very pretty!! There are 2 side areas that you can visit. If you get lost there are local guide which offering you help to reach the area. 
Beautiful ,"Hanok Village I will fully recommend those who need to take pic and enjoy the view of the village. It was beautiful and the village offer many things such food area, shopping and souvenirs. "
Must to visit!,"This is a MUST! to visit, this place is definitely one of the most important historic places in Seoul, you can find lots of souvenirs and also rent a traditional Hanboks dresses and much more."
Traditional ,Narrow streets with more traditional korean houses. Very crowded with many tourists though. Few souvenir shops and a couple of cafes.
My favourite thing to do in Seoul,"Excellent part of the city - beautiful houses, nice little shops, good food - great for walking around and get lost ;) Artsy and beautiful area, close to the main palaces. Cannot wait to be back!"
Wow! Ancient Homes in the Midst of Bustling Seoul,"After visiting the palace, I continued my walk and ended up here at this ancient portion of town, where I believe the homes are about six hundred years old. I walked the alleyways to get a real feel for the homes there. In this area you will also find cute shops and some restaurants. I felt very safe walking around by myself."
Stunning houses and streets,"We visited as part of our Seoul full day tour. Stunning houses and streets. If you visit you need to be quiet. The residents love their little community, but it is popular with tourists as it's so stuuning. "
Pretty but busy,"Very easy to get from subway, very pretty, and the people dressed in traditional costumes looked amazing, small than I thought it would be but worth a visit"
Nice place to visit,"This village is an area in the city center of Seoul very famous because you can find there the traditional houses, where nowadays people live. Actually I expected them to be more authentic, but in fact those houses have been renewed and they have just tha appeal of a traditional building! I went there on a Saturday afternoon and in the streets there was also a handmade market with lot of jewellery and artisanal products. The place is also full of bar and cafes where you can have a break dipped into this tipical atmosphere. "
Not that great ,This village is actually local residential area. There were shops that provides the traditional hanbok where tourist can walk around and take pictures. You don’t really feel welcome there as there were few protest signs on local unhappiness. 
Culture to touch,The Hanok Village is a great place for you if you wanna explore the culture parts of Korea. You can rent a hanbok (traditional cloth) or vitit old houses and get some tea. 
A touristic thing...,"It has been a pretty long walk from Gyeongbokgung but, actually, there's nothing to see.it should be an ancient typical korean village, but it has become a tourist thing, with shops and many coffee houses.There are many other places in Korea if you want to see a typical village."
Experience the old way,This Korean traditional houses are interesting and for me a must experience. The traditional villages have lots of alleys and the house have open air in the center court with rooms around it. We stayed in one of them in order to have the sleep experience. Sleeping on the futons and enjoy the close community. 
Korean traditional houses,"This place with Korean traditional houses is very popular for tourists for sightseeing. There's a place where the tourists can get experience the korean traditions such as Tea time,korean traditional game,... It's really interesting place for visit. "
Highly recommended to visit - Mix of modern & quaint buildings,"Very pleasant to stroll around the village which is mostly made out of quaint buildings. Although a tourist attraction, it's still a residential area. Some parts of the village are quite hilly so be prepared for some steep walking. Along the main street, it has some nice cafes, restaurants & souvenir shops. Overall, visiting Bukchion Hanok Village must be one of the items in your itinerary when visiting Seoul."
Amazing place,"Great place, great atmosphere, a must visit before even other places. Need an hour to two hours minimum. "
Lost in the city,"A small town outside the city, a must to visit in Seoul. You also have great view on the city. Take time to walk around and not only go in THE tourist road !"
Tour With Oppa,We did a tour here of the village. I loved it. It's a beautiful historic site with lots of interesting history and it has been apart of different KDramas. Lots of walking but worth the trip.
Beauty!,"These streets are unique and must be seen. Although there are guards to warn us to be quiet, you can observe today’s artists houses. Perfect!"
Traditional village but not too old,You should keep silent when you go here and the contour is going up so keep your energy. I love Jeonju Village much better but this is also a nice place.
Very quaint. Just feel sorry for the residents ,"The village is close to the main palace, set close to some trendy shops and cafes.It's a great place to wander and get lost.It attracts a lot of tourists so worth remembering this is a residential area and the locals deserve to be respected. There are people around trying to get people to keep the noise down and stop you from entering the doorways of houses."
Small area but worth it,"Good to visit the place and see the traditional houses.Try to find EGG DROP sandwiches, they sell really good sanwiches. It was very sunny in summer, so pls bring your necesseties. I think qinter is the best time to visit the place. Bec we wanted to try thr traditional costume but it is too hot so we have to pass."
"If you don't have a teenage girl, it's quite boring","Girls who like to dress up will find it amusing to stroll the streets with the traditional Korean attire. For the rest of us, however, it's quite a boring place. Tourist-trap prices, not very pretty (lots of electrical wires hanging low between houses, looks somewhat run-down), and quite exhausting to go up and down the streets in the humid heat of summer with no clear aim, except seeing some old houses here and there."
Put comfy shoes on for this hilly walk,This was really enjoyable walk to the top. There's a lot of unique shops at the bottom and a Cafe at the top that has a 5000won entry fee as it doubles as an art gallery. Be careful not to slip if it's raining and note there are a lot of signs to keep quiet as it's a residential area and even people enforcing the silance. Families with loud kids take note
Bukchon Hanok ,"Great place to go. There are free guides - our guide is Seong II Yoo. The walk around the lanes, stories about the past, architecture and history Great place to visit "
An afternoon immersing in traditional culture of wearing Hanbok,"We rented the Korean traditional outfit, Hanbok and wore it at Bukchon Hanbok Village. It was a scorching afternoon but certainly a great experience of being like a Korean for an afternoon. This activity is recommended to people who are looking to immerse in Korean traditional culture! "
Uphill walks,"It is actually a beautiful Korean village filled with Korean styled houses. However, it is located on a hilly area. So do expect some uphill walks while there. There are signs posted around the area and staff wearing high vis vests patrolling to remind tourists to keep their voices down as it is still a residential area. Interesting to see the Korean styled houses."
"Beautiful place to visit but, be polite!","This is a very nice and quiet area of Seoul. Well conserves streets, you can imagine the old Seoul walking among those streets...but is a real neighborhood so be respectful!!!"
Walking along Bukchon Hanok Village,"We were there leisurely walking through the streets of Bukchon Hanok Village. It was a memorable one for me seeing those traditional korean houses. I regret not having worn the Han Bok custume. It could have been so challenging walking with that custume. It was worth the visit. If I have the chance to visit Seoul again, I would gladly come back to this place again."
Fascinating place,"Fascinating area, still inhabited by regular people not just kept as a historical landmark. We stayed at one of the guesthouses in that area. Authentic hanok house. Amazing experience. Highly recommend to anyone. The only downside - streets are never empty, crowds of tourists are everywhere. Unless you wake up really early. Crowds take away some charm from this place. "
Past meets present. Bring comfy shoes.,"Bukchon was really the only thing I wanted to see in Korea. We went on a tour and I was quite disappointed, not by the village, but by the tour guide who rushed us through. It also started pissing it down raining. I managed to get some decent shots which I have to edit, but I could have used more time. The houses are all still inhabited and are worth upwards of a million dollars each. Although the facades are required to be preserved, the interior of the houses are all very modern and updated. There's signs asking tourists to keep their voices down, no loud pictures, music or talking. I guess some rude westerners had caused problems in the past. Anyway, bring comfy walking shoes as there are a lot of hills in the village. Bring a wide angle lens as well."
The old style architecture of Korea ,There are many houses with the traditional Korean architecture. It is worth to wall around. Koreans are respectful and they expect tourists to be respectful too. So it is nice to keep voices down while going around the neighborhood. ;)
Bukchon Hanoi Village ,Beautiful village with interesting architecture. It’s a residential area so it’s important to be quiet and respectful when walking around. Cute little shops and lovely views.
Nice but not really special ,It is nice to wonder around. But if you have only a few days....skip it.To may people.....Ok lots of small nice shops.... but as soon as you know you are out of the district. So practical there are just a few nice streets...
A must see ,"The neighborhood has the largest collection of privately owned hanoks, or traditional Korean homes with tiled roofs, stone floors and amazing wooden doors, in Seoul. It’s located on in a hilly neighborhood nestled between Gyeongbok Palace and Changdeok Palace which are both walkable for this location. While I strolled through Bukchon Village up, down, back and forth it may feel like a trip through the ages, the neighborhood is not frozen in time. Some of the hanoks are still private homes, but others have been converted into tea houses, coffee shops. These are neat little places to get a look inside on of these beauties majority of them be historically updated renovations but they kept it to the err of time. I really enjoyed my time even while it rained. Remember people still live here so a quiet ordinance is in place and is patrolled. "
Nice residential area,Nice place walked for about n hour n then left for palace which is near by old traditional houses n people still live their so u need to b decent by not disturbing them n making noise or knocking doors Lots of art houses traditional shops and cafes 
Traditional Korean house,This is a cluster of Korean houses (Hanok) situated nearby the palaces in Gangbok.Most of the houses have been modernised but maintained the traditional Korean architecture design.It’s on an incline and may be a challenge for older people or parents with strollers.Generally a residential area and will have to observe general etiquette when visiting this area.
A nice traditional village,"It's a nice traditional village that located in a big modern city. Here, you can admire korean traditional architecture through hanok house. There are some cute souvenir shops here. It takes time if you come here for the first time because there are many corners so that you have to explore to looking for nice spot for photos. Be quiet because it's residence area. You can rent hanbok outside and come here to take some great photos. And don't forget to check Baek Je In museum house. You can enter the house. It's really nice"
A route only for the healthy and adventurous,"We spent so little time there in the morning, as we brought our parents. We visited a nice cafe inside that served delicious muffin and drinks.Some of the routes are steep, and require good stamina. Heck, we just stayed for around 30 min walking and maybe another 30 in that cafe. We just had a couple of good photos (since we were all dressed in hanbok) and left.Maybe if I travle with friends someday I will visit this village again, maybe even make a traditional stamps or two. But travelling as a family... I won't recommend this place."
Nice place to visit but there are so many people,"Many nice traditional houses, there are so many shops and cafes on walking street. But it’s so crowded, some people talk loudly even though they have attention boards. It made us not enjoyable, although its great place to visit. Luckily we went to another part, its a short street. less people "
Very pretty,"Picturesque village, can have a walk around, and look at the old style buidlings, also lots of souvenir shops and food"
Picture Perfect ,We rent a hanbok in Bukchon Hanok Village. It was a beautiful place for taking pictures in a hanbok. Many historic and ancient korean house there. Overall it's beautiful.
Long walk for nothing,"It was nothing like in the pictures, and way more smaller. If you come here, you won’t be able to understand what is a traditional Korean village. It looks like it just visited to be the perfect instaspot, but even for that, you’ ve to be in the perfect position, otherwise it’s nothing."
Beautiful but busy,A super place to see some traditional Korean architecture but it can get busy with tourists taking photos. Be sure to get there as early as possible to avoid the lunchtime rush and enjoy the cultural alleyways in peace.
Traditional Korean Houses,"Lovely neighborhood with privately owned hanoks. Start out at the Tradional Cultural Center and pick up a free detailed area map. The Cultural Center has restrooms and displays of typical hanok houses that you can peek inside. Shops and restaurants are along the way although on a Tuesday morning there did not seem to be many places open but the crowd was also sparse. Signage is good at helping one find the way. Some of the streets are steep. We took the metro getting off at Anguk Station, exit 3."
Korean national dress optional!,"Probably the quaintest part of Seoul, this neighborhood is a great place to spend a Sunday morning. Wander up and down the hill and look at the beautiful old houses with incredible details. There are cafes, small shops, and galleries dotted around for refreshment or a spot of shopping. There are also shops renting our Korean national costumes, perfect for an IG moment!"
Nice To Walk Around - 很值得走一走,"It is nice to walk around the area if you are in the city. Up & down hills with ancient houses, nice small shops & restaurants, cozy cafe & design goods, this is the area worths to spend at least couple hours. Popular cafe houses, restaurants, photo taking spots & local and ancient life sightseeing can be all found.如果你在首爾，這裡肯定適合走一走，上坡下坡於老房子、很不錯的小店和餐廳、舒服的咖啡廳和設計小店，這個地方可以花個幾小時慢慢走一走，有名又受歡迎咖啡、餐廳、拍照熱點和當地又古老的生活在這裡都找得到。"
Beautiful area,"This is just gorgeous, it is worth the steep and long walks, a lot of empty, narrow and cute sidewalks and streets great views and great spots for photos. This is an amazing area to feel the traditional Korean culture. "
Beautiful traditional place,"I love this place, very beautiful. Don’t forget to have some handmade dumplings after walking around and taking lots of photos "
What an amazing place,We visited on a Sunday morning while it was quiet. So able to walk around freely before the crowds. Amazing photo opportunities along the route. Ditch the guide book and just go for a wonder. Free museum and galleries also made for interesting tour. Steep roads in some places. What an amazing place the neighbourhood was aliving museum. Well worth the 3.8mile walk. 
Korean Traditional Houses and Practices,"Try walking around this area maybe around 1pm for you to be able to enjoy every traditional practice they can offer, including weaving, doll/crafts making, paintings, house scents and even food because it all closes at 6pm. They also offer wearing of Hanbok for only 7000KRW in one day.The area is a community, with people living in the old houses so they have these signs which tells you to minimize your noise. But when you walk around, it feels like tradition meets modernization. Roofing of houses are still old but there are newer buildings which conforms to traditional architecture. And try to spot the house of their ""national"" artists (or so i thought) living in the area.The people in the neighborhood are friendly too, they will tell you which way to go and what to do on the area, and there are also Tourism officers dressed in red where you can ask questions."
Traditional houses,"I visited this place in the afternoon at 1630hr to avoid the morning tour groups. There were pockets of visitors exploring this area. It is a general uphill walk to view the traditional houses in narrow lanes, called hanok, that dated back to the Joseon Dynasty.Most of these houses are private residential, hence there are many signs as well as staff to remind visitors to lower their noises. Some of these hanoks operate as souvenir shops, restaurants and tea houses. Well worth a visit together with the nearby palaces."
very traditional,"if you would like to experience old Korea, I strongly recomend to go Bukchon rather than Insadong. Bukchon is less commerciallization. "
clean and nice neighborhood,Nice place to visit when you are in the area. You can find nice traditional houses but of course you can only take pictures outside since people actually live in them.You need to be quiet too.
Interesting,"If you like long walking, looking at old buildings. Then this is for you. I don't think it's really suitable for people who have difficult in walking because some place as hilly. In order to visit this place, it is very near to Anguk station. After visiting this place, you can also go to Unhyeongung Palace which is around Anguk station as well"
A walk through the past,A must do when in Seoul. Make sure to rent a hanbok before walking through this area to have a complete experience. Just make sure to respect the residents of the area and keep your noise at a minimum. 
One of my favorites spots in Seoul.,"Cobble line streets, historical neighborhoods, swanky cafe's, eateries, easy access by metro, quaint neighborhoods make this one of my top destinations in Seoul."
Not worth it,"We went on a very hot day, after reading our tourist guide we found our way there very easy , but how disappointing, the normal cheap tacky tourist shops at the entrance , and then what looked like new houses trying to look old , very steep hill going up , nothing really to see, big disappointment .Glad I never paid a guide to take us there ."
Must come for the restaurants after,"According to data by the Bukchon Traditional Culture Center, 30,000 people visited the area in 2007. However, after the village was featured in television programmes, such as 1 night 2 days and Personal taste , the number rose to 318,000 in 2010. In 2012 the figure is expected to double to more than 600,000.During the Korean War, in between 37°N and 38°N was totally destroyed particularly Seoul and this old village was the only refurbished and awarded by UNESCO for their effort to resurrect the Korean Cultures.Due to too many tourists overwhelmingly the neighborhood, Sunday was closed. Although this is a must place to visit but is not worth the while for hours of walking around. However, there are a number of good restaurants nearby that you must try and perfectly blended into your tour schedule."
TRADITIONAL HOMES--WORTH A SHORT VISIT,"This was part of our tour of South Korea and Mongolia..The village a good spot to see traditional Korean homes, but it does involve a fair amount of walking. These are occupied dwellings, so one can only see the facades and roofs of the houses."
Silence please,You have to be sensitive when you go to this place because this is a residential area. It has many souvenir shops and ice cream shops.Old housesYou will see many peopke wearing hanbokOutdoor activity
"nice to visit but be warned, a lot of walking and hiking","it is very tiring to climb all the hills just to get to the photo scenic spots, but i think they're worth it..? the view is really nice. on the base of the path there are some shops around too. i wouldn't go again, but once is good enough :)"
Charming traditional Korean houses in a hilly village ,Bukchon Hanok Village is located to the east of Gyeongbokgung and I guess in the olden days the houses here would be likely to be owned or occupied by people who worked in the palace.This is a charming village with old Hanok houses and some modernised houses. It is a residential area so there are signs and staff reminding tourists not to talk loudly.Some boutique shops offer hanbok (Korean dresses) for rent so you could take pictures wearing the traditional dress.Some sections are quite steep so be aware.
Experience traditional Korean housing,Wandering the streets and alleyways of the Bukchon Hanok Village is both entertaining and educaitonal and helps one appreciate classic building methods.
nice for photos,there are really beautiful traditional houses originally built by royal family members and noblemen who wanted to be close to the palace. 
Tired but worth it ,"The village is located on the hill, so you have to walk up a bit. To avoid being lost, you can get a map from tourist information before entering "
Must visit place,"if you are looking for traditional Korean building, but not a theme park? Bukchon Hanok village is the right place to visit. It is close from palace and samcheongdong. you will see tons of tourist around this area, but you will find out why so many people visit this place when you actually see the place."
residential village with beautiful buildings,Take a walk thru this residential area with beautiful korean style buildings - whispering is necessary as the residents should not be bothered. it is a steep walk but worth it. At the entrance some nice souvenir shops to visit. 
Pretty as a Postcard,"Some dress in the hanbok costumes to do Instagram photos. It's just very picturesque with the hanok houses with tiled pagoda roofs, beautiful doors, walls, flowers, etc. Walking up the alleys there are lots of tourists and one needs to respect the residents and keep the noise down. This traditional Korean village is between the palaces and so worth walking around in to just see the beauty of this architecture."
See The Open House,"The walk through this traditional neighborhood was enhanced by visiting a home that the city had acquired and opened to visitors. We were able to walk into the courtyard and then after removing our shoes, enter the house where 3 rooms were available to us to walk through. In one room, traditional tables and chairs were setup on the floor but it was not so easy to sit down. In the other rooms were displays of vases made out of wood and a person was available to answer questions. We continued walking through the very narrow and sometimes steep streets looking at the other homes and cafes. We also stopped by the Bukchon Traditional Crafts Experience Center which was a building that housed a number of local craftspeople who taught you about traditional Korean crafts for a small fee."
Holiday,"I heard so much about this place I had to go. The issue for me is I was expecting a self contained village of original traditional style. The buildings are styled in the traditional sense but they are mixed between modern apartments and houses. There is really only one street with the same style of housing and the sight of air conditioners, wiring and hot water services detracts from the traditional aspect. There are attendants at each end of the street holding signs asking people not to make noise as this disturbs the residents. There are a few souvenirs shops and some very modern cafes in the village. Pleasant to look at overall but nothing like the promotion given to the area. "
Area with traditional houses,"Bukchon village is actually a private housing estates prized with traditional Hanok houses. Hence, there will be volunteers to ask you to not to make too much noises to avoid disturbing the residences. It is located near the gyeongbukhung and changdeokgung palace grounds and within walking distance from Anguk station. It is just an area with lots of traditional houses where you can rent Hanboks and walk around the area for photo taking. It is a very tiring climb and not recommended for older folks with knee issues. But the hike up is worth is for the magnificent view. We did not pay for the observatory as the view up on the hill was good enough. Worth a visit but only if you are in the area."
Buchon Hanok village,Beautiful place to be. Great view from the top of the hill. I heard a the place is popular for filming Korean TV dramas.
Wish to have one unit,It was amazing the way it was built. Have a hard time walking to the top and we made it. I am impressed with structural design even though the buildings aged with the passing of time. Great place to visit.
Do visit with a guide,The area is not very big but you can get disoriented and end up going around in circles. Best to go with a local or plan your walking route well. Buildings here are beautiful and some are renovated so you can spot the difference roofing modern and original. Do look out for the beautifully hand crafted clay tiles in some of the original roof of the Hanoks. Do make a stop at the Baek Inje House in Gahoe-dong area. This is free and you can see the interior layout of a typical Hanok house. Absolutely beautiful! 
Worth a visit,"Great to visit traditional village and see that these homes are still lived in. A lot of them have been turned into tea houses , souvenir shops etc. There are some that offer workshops in various Korean crafts. Beware- it is all uphill."
Great place to spend a few hours,"Nice place to walk and spend a few hours, some good shops and cafesPostcard perfect views of old against a backdrop of new."
Quiet place,Nothing much to see except some old houses and nice ice cream. Go if you have extra time. I won't go again. 
Cute part of town,"The area nearby to the palace has some of the traditional Korean housing as well as some interesting shops. It is a residential area, so visitors are exhorted by signs and uniformed monitors to keep their voices down in respect for the residents.Set in the side of a hill the streets are narrow and winding and there are some cute houses that evoke another time. Shops include art galleries and unique crafts - a great place to find that special souvenir."
Bukchon Hanok Village is Great!,"My daughter and I wandered the streets in the Bukchon Hanok Village and enjoyed tea and rice cakes at a cafe. It was a lovely place, with a wonderful sense of history. I imagine the residents to be very patient as there were many sighteseers walking the streets when we visited there. "
Picturesque glimpse of the past,"This historic area is definitely worth a visit while you're in Seoul. I went on a weekday, so it was less crowded than I've heard it gets at the weekends. You'll encounter many people walking around in traditional clothing they've hired for the day - this adds to the atmosphere if you set your imagination to work! The village is hilly and very pretty in the springtime, with some great views over nearby areas of Seoul. The village is still a residential area and offers a contrast to the modernity of all the high-rise apartment buildings, and a link to the past."
A good meander... but SHHHHH!,"Took a lovely walk through the housing area, just a quick turn off from Samseong-dong. The terrain was hilly and be prepared to use your calves!"
Somewhat underwhelming,"There’s no clear path to follow through this traditional village in a sense that, you just wander through the streets but aren’t told where to look or what to look at. We found this didn’t allow us to properly engage with the location, and as a result we most likely didn’t get the most out of our visit. Some of the houses you see will be the most beautiful in the entire city, but it’s still hard to distinguish what’s what here."
Picturesque,"Great to look at, you feel you've stepped back a century. Other than that novelty bear in mind it's a residential area so doesn't really have anything other than the experience of the traditional houses (from the outside only) to offer. Great photo ops."
Ok,Not bad but not a lot to see. Fairly packed with tourists even on a rainy day. Expected more to be honest. 
Way too crowded,"The houses look great and it's nice to walk around here, but it was absolutely packed with tourists."
Good to see their traditional places alike..,"This is people's housing area/resident. At same time they do business such as rent Hanbok, tea/coffee shop, souvenirs.. You can spend sometime here and need to walk up to high slope across all the street. The scenery here is beautiful. You can take few pics on how this unique street looks so traditional and beautiful. I guess for me, its a bit too hype on this place but for me i would give just a average review. Actually nothing much u can do here.. Surrounded by buildings."
Some old and some new,"Bukchon Hanok Village is situated in the middle of modern part of the city. Once you find it, the area is beautiful and you can enjoy a walk through the hillyneighbourhood of traditional Korean houses. Because the houses are occupied, all you see are the outside. Below the village, there are restaurants and shops catered for tourist.A 'must' visit attraction in Seoul, no sure."
Great mix of traditional and new,"Really enjoyed the walk around this hilly neighborhood. Clearly it’s gone thru changes and you’d need some money to live here, but the mix of new and old and the views made it a great tourist experience"
Well preserved old traditional korean houses (Hanok),"Beautiful area on the hill with small alleys, many still inhabited traditional korean houses (Hanok). Need a bit of hike and from the top of the village we can see good view of Seoul. A must visit attraction in Seoul. Quite crowded with tourists, but still can find some quiter areas."
Nice,We like it here nice and relaxing and quite too you can walk around here and outside have a lot restaurant and shopping too
very romantic!,A nice romantic local korean village. Walk in korean costume to have great photos!!Also has lots of small restaurants to try.
A moment to reflect ,"We were lucky enough to walk through the streets to the less crowded ones and come across the Bukchon Observatory ... when no one was there. It was 3000 per adult, which included a beverage and a balcony to sit and contemplate the scene and passage of time of the 600 year old village below. We enjoyed tracing our way up and over the hill and admiring the detail of the homes while respecting the privacy of the residents in the area who are constantly faced with the selfie stick / Instagram crowds chattering away and blocking the streets or posing with private property rather than simply enjoying the architecture and vibe of the area. "
Definitely a Must Visit!,It was like being transported back in time. Definitely a must just to observe and admire the architectural feats alone. Take the time to explore this cultural gem. You will not be disappointed!
Vies,This place is a good visit with great view and peace Cos the there are residents leaving in those houses. There’s a nice cafe on the way to the cafe. Can have it before or after 
History meets modern ,"This place was great to see such old homes, however some have high tech door bells from Samsung so old meets modern! I would highly suggest visiting here"
Korean Traditional village in Seol,Just a few minutes away from Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changdeokung Palace lies on top of the hill is the Bukchon Hanok Village. Before entering the village were told by our tour guide to observe silence and respect the neighborhood. Strolled a few alleys quitely and took pictures of Korean Houses for memories sake. Spent around 30 minutes aound the area and proceeded our next stop.
Well worth wandering round,"Was glad to have been accompanied by a guide who explained the background to this “preserved” area and the various anomalies of ugly, more modern buildings whose time, thankfully, may be up soon"
Traditional houses in korea,"If you are interested in architecture and how the Korean houses are constructed, this is one place that you have to visit to enjoy it. The houses are simply beautifully crafted and the place is peaceful. Getting there by foot after morning of much sightseeing nearby sights can be quite tiring as there are quite a number of slopes to walk through."
Beautiful traditional houses,Visited the village in the weekend and it was very crowded with tourists taking pictures in traditional clothing. The houses looks great and are obviously still inhabited so visitors are requested to be quiet!
Tradisional house,"In this village, you will see a lot of Traditional Korean House with various model. A lot of tourist will take picture witb the background of this house. This is a must to go place if you visit seoul."
Below initial expectations but worth to take the walk,"We expected to see something else, so slight disappointment. But many people around with traditional dress for photo shooting, interesting architecture make it enough sexy to take the walk."
Don’t miss,"Don’t miss this place. This is one herritage place with lots of thing to do. But must be quiet because this is a real village, there still have people stay here. Almost shops will close at 5 pm. Reccommend be here in the afternoon after visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace."
A breath of Korea inside Seoul,Feel free to visit this traditional pretty neighborhood right in the heart of Seoul! Of course you have to respect the residents and take a quiet walk through the small streets! 
Overrated,"There is ther famous 8 views of the village. You can definitely skip most of it. Or at least i did. Be prepared to climb slopes. The place is still a residental area, so keep your volume done. Too many tourists to take nice photos."
Interesting but not worth going out of the way to see,This was part of a tour and it's lots of traditional houses in a specific part of Seoul. The houses are not open to the public and before you go you are asked not to make too much noise as its residential. There are people there with signs saying don't make too much noise. You really don't see the houses inside it's just the exterior and they are 100 years old it was interesting but I don't think I would make it my business to take time out to go there to see it specifically. It would be nice if one hone was on view. 
Go early or late: Too many tourists!,"Family of 3 adults. We would include this as a PART of your day - early or late. Too many tourists in-between :( However, for those tourists that hire the Hanbok costume … and to see them here... adds for thinking of what it might used to be like in the old days: 600 years ago! Also, just South nearby, is a restaurant called Warm Kitchen, Share Kitchen (opposite the Library and just beyond Pink Butter café in Samcheong-ro 2-gil Road - where you will see a man in a Panda costume to entice you in: don't be put off!) which was a very tasty place for a quick lunch and good value :)"
Overrated,"I feel like this is more a tourist trap than a tourist attraction. Tourist trap because many local businesses overprice their food and drinks, and products.If you want to get the true feeling of a Hanok village, visit the one in Jeonju. Less crowded and great restaurants."
AwesomeExperience ,Highly recommend this place for great photos in your hanbok (traditional Korean dress) There are a few store that allows you to rent these costumes for 18000KW for 3hrs. Please take note that you are only allowed to try on a costume twice. Every other time thereafter you will be charged.Visit the palace and try traditional Korean food at reasonable prices. So many cool places to take the perfect-shot. 
Travel back in time,I'm kindda a history buff so having to experience walking along and inside the urban environment dating back 600 years ago was a chance not to be missed. The houses are so well maintained and beautiful to look at. Love it here!
Beautiful but hard to find,"We got lost searching this place, even when we asked around and was using the Google maps. It was beautiful but a bit crowded. Not really a ""must-see"" in my opinion, but the houses looked beautiful."
Getting to Bukchon Hanoi Village,"I read from previous review that some people got lost when they walked to Bukchon after visiting Gyeongbukong Palace.I suggest that after visiting Gyeongbukong Palace, head towards Subway Gyeongbukong Palce, leave exit 2 and head to Tosochok for the famous ginseng chicken for lunch. After lunch taking the subway 1 stop to Anguk and take the exit to Bukchon. Walked on the main road northwards for about 5-10 mins. You will reached the obvious entrance of the village on the left. Do remember to cross over to the other side and see the other parts of the village. By the time you walked over the other side you will be near Anguk station again. Please use Waver map in Korea. Goggle map can still used but not accurate."
My Mini Family Spring Vacay 2019,"This year we choose spring for our vacation.It was our 2 yrs wishlist and this year we found it by walking from myeongdong area and if we knew it was not far from our hostel stayed back in 2017..We rented a hanbok & we can walk along the area with our hanbok,why not right?Our hanbok this year i can say it was more pretty that our hanbok we wore at Ihwa Mural Village back in 2017 "
MUST SEE PLACE,"If you come to Korea, this is one place you have to come and visit. Place was so clean and people polite and courteous. The view was fantastic. "
Beautiful location frozen in time a little,It is a functional township that sees thousands of tourists every day.Be respectful and be quiet while there.It is a lovely walk. Head into the museum shop just over the top of the street. Has beautiful souvenirs and even some very well priced antiques.
Traditional Korean Houses,It is a lovely residential are with beautiful houses on every street and corner. Here you can see people wearing Hanboks (you can rent them from the shops nearby) walking around. Take a nice leisure stroll along these lanes and you will see the beautiful architecture of these old houses. You will also find delicious and cheap fresh fruits and local sweets sold from a truck. I didn't want to upload pictures of people's homes in respect of their privacy.
Signs telling tourists to stay away,"I'm not sure if we went at a bad time, but there were signs posted everywhere about how the people who lived there were suffering from tourists, and asking tourists to stay away for a while. Near the the entrance, it looked like there was some kind of filming going on (for a news station). We entered, but upon seeing the signs, we left, since we didn't want to disturb them."
Ancient Korea arrchitecture,This is a beautiful village with ancient architecture and traditional house of Korea.Beautiful place to have good photos.You should visit here early morning because of crowed people.
Traditional Village,"A very nice place with steep slope. The area is occupied with residents and offices, good to be there with Hanok to get pretty photos with nice background."
Instagram worthy! ,"The place is about 10-15minutes away from the nearest station. If you are lost, there are friendly tourist guides along the way, who can explain how to get there. Be sure to rent any traditional Korean dresses (hanbok) for that Instagram worthy pictures before going up the hill. Because it is a residential area, tourists are adviced to keep quiet and to not make any noises. There are also lots of coffee shops and cafés nearby for people to rest while taking photos"
Nice Area of Local and Traditional House,It's a residence area. Better come here on early morning because so many people come here to take photos. People shd be quiet if visit this area. Only 1 alley which famous with its hanok house and so many people took photos here with hanbok. But nice to walk around this area and took some photos with hanok style house using hanbok or not. The road is quite step. So it's not for elderly people. Also near to changdeokgung palace.
See the traditional house of Seoul,"i take my kids here to learn the traditional house of Korea, a lots of wonderful home to see, even some of we can't take a picture of it"
First time here!,"Quaint area, love the details of the houses here, and I’m not disappointed with this tour. This time of year is the best time for me, weather is cool, needed to wear jacket. We had a great time, slow paced, totally relaxing tour. "
 Traditional view of Korea,We explored an alley which is famously known for traditional korean house/street. It is located at Bukchon-ro 11-gil street. It has view of namsan tower. We went there around 8pm (weekdays) which less crowd and manage to snap some photos. Just to remember not to make so much noise as the resident might be sleeping. #instagrammableplaceinseoul 
Old village in the city,"If you're looking for a place you can stroll around, this is it. We were there in mid March, there were no sakura blossoms that time. It could have been perfect scenery with the blossoms. The village has the old houses but not as many. It's more like a big park that's a bit hilly with sakura trees. Some people go there for a jog. I recommend this place for those who want to see sakura flowers in April. There might be some event show sometime as I've noticed a stage and benches."
Step Back in Time,Perhaps a 30-minute walk from Gyeongbakgung Palace is the historical village of Bukchon Hanok Village. This extraordinary village is made of up homes from the traditional style of Korean homes. It is still a living village where people live so when you visit you must be respectful of the fact that you are on their residence. The homes are gorgeous and truly bring you back in time. Where comfortable shoes are the streets are hilly and you need to be in good shape. Well worth a visit for a few hours.
Great place to visit,"This is an interesting area to visit, especially on a Sunday when many local people dress in their national costume.The walks are easy and there are some cafes etc on route."
Nice and cute area!,Take the free map at the information center and they tell you which route you can take to see nice houses and cafes. 
good place to see korean culture ,this place is not really a tourist place but Koreans actually stillare living privately in this place. It is a good place to see the old way of life and culture. You need to be very quiet when visiting this place. Nice for picture taking.
Nice but too crowded,"Bukchon Hanok Village is pretty much close to Gyeongbokgung Palace. After visiting the palace, you can walk yourself to this heritage village with ease.PROS:-Paved road going to the village. If you’re bringing kids in strollers, it will be easier.-Since this is located in a residential area, even if there’s a lot of visitors, you will feel the quietness of the area. -Tourism staff are everywhere in case you lose your way. You’ll also see them bringing placards reminding everyone to be quiet.-You will also see a lot of souvenir shops in the area. Some food stalls too in case you need something to munch in.CONS:-There’s nothing much to do other than take photos with the old houses as your background-Tourists flock to the area on a daily basis so be prepared to get your way to get good photos-If you’re bringing a car, there’s not much parking space available as the alleys are really narrow. Street parking is not a good idea.-Get yourself ready for a lot of walking.Will I go back to Bukchon again? Probably not but it’s always good to see these types of heritage at least once."
Bukchon ,"I enjoyed a lot been on this “neighbourhood”, it’s obviously that this is a very ancient place in Seoul. Is very close from the main palace in Seoul, I remember that you have to be like “quiet” in that place cause when I started to talk louder the people from there shut/silenced me. You can take you pictures with the people there, some of them are friendly and some of them are not, there’s also a place for souvenirs that are not very costly."
S.Korea Village,"Place to visit while in Myeongbokgung palace, you can walk or take the bus to the village. They have good restaurant, authentic korean food. Try Beef Bulgogi, chicken soup, and kimchi fried rice."
Disappointing Hanok Village,The village is not so great. Only a small part is beautiful and good for taking photos. Other than that nothing much. I think Jeonju will be much better. 
Korean Traditional Village on a Hill,"It is a residential area where you can see old traditional Korean Houses on a hill. Some are more than 500 years old. Many foreigners rent a Hanbok which is traditional Korean attire and take pictures there. Also, take a picture at the street museum in the urban core. Furthermore, there are many small Korean restaurants and coffee shops in the area...a great place to have lunch. And a great viewing point"
Uphill climb,"Is about 10 mins slow walk from Anguk Station Exit no. 2. Is a residential place. Therefore do keep your voices low so. as not to disturb the locals. Not suitable for elderly as there is quite a fair bit of uphill climb. We went in early afternoon and there was not much crowd. There were little shops, cafes along the way. Is a serene walk. "
Beautiful,This has been kept as a heritage place with all sound boards in Korean.Get a local to explain the details.Have tea and time cakes at a traditional tea house.
Steep walk,"If you're going to Bukchon, best to go in the morning because it gets crowded in the afternoon. The streets are quite a climb so its not recommended for those who tire easily."
City visit,"Unfortunately it is just so busy, full of tourists like ourselves! But these are huge busloads of them and the area to view the houses is just so small. It should maybe be restricted to non bus tours. The houses are so pretty and well kept, good to walk round the tiny little streets. "
Tour,Interesting to visit the outside of the houses in that village. Quite unique as compared to city dwellings. Reminder of done K drama scenes. 
Nice to see,This place is very popular because of the renowned korean moviescenes. Very interesting to see. Along this place are great food and restaurant.
Feels like korean,I am not reqlly a fan of korean novela but I reqlly want to go here and wear their suit. It was a great experience though there’s a lot of tourist who are taking pictures still I m still hooked.
An authentic village - be quited please,There are a famous destination for touristActually there still an houses for the local peopleA crowded place..Every door is noted “please be quite.. dont disturb..”But too bad the tourists is cannot read and dont care... talk aloud.. laugh aloud..I just can psssstttttt....hffffttt too bad
Weektrip Seoul,"Local old Korean style houses, nice to walk through for a while with interesting small shops and craftmanship stores but not that impressive"
This is selfie heaven for Korean people ,"These heritage homes and streets are nicely preserved and presented. It's nice to explore and sample Korean life.It seems to be the number 1 selfie location for Koreans, hire a traditional costum, and join them."
A lovely walk amongst traditional houses. ,It was our first afternoon in Seoul and we wandered around here for a few hours in the spring sunshine. Although it is allegedly closed on Sundays it certainly wasn’t. Many a Korean here dressed in hanbok’s added to the scenes. It may not be suitable for those with walking difficulties as much of it is up and down hills. 
Lovely buildings,"This is less of a village, but more a collsction of old buildings dotted around with one or two streets where the whole areahas been preserved. There is also a new, reconstruction of a hanok building showing their construction. It's interestng walking around the larger area as it's got some nice little shops, coffee bars and food shops. It's also a large residential areas with noise wardens to keep the tourists no use at wispering level. A great idea as it's people's homes and their local street we're walking through.Well worth a visit."
Lovely,"Despite the crowds, this is a lovely place to visit. Seeing the architecture and knowing the history of the area makes it worthwhile. Finish the visit with a pleasant spot of tea at a traditional tea house."
Used to live here. Nice place.,I lived next to bukchon for 18 months. Nice place to wonder around and see some traditional Korean style houses. Just remember people live here so it's not a tourist attraction in the true sense of the word. Be respectful when visiting.
Gorgeousness right in the middle of Seoul,Not necessary to wear your rented Hanbok here but is was gorgeous as easy enough to get to from main palace. This is the place to find a tea house. Sorry that I did not mark the location or name of tea house but the owner mentioned that the home is her inheritance. The teas were excellent and this is a lovely strolling area. 
Cute and old school little village,"Lots of uphill and downhill slopes. The buildings are old school. There are many little shops and coffee/dessert restaurants. It’s a nice stroll around the area. I got a nice fedora for 10,000. "
Cool,This is embarrising but pretty. We ate in the village then we put dresses. Even onni suri she weared the hundok. 
Beautiful Place,"The place is easy to reach by using public transport, it is a traditional Korean houses in the middle of Seoul, it nice to see the old Koreans lifestyle, it is best to visit after 10 AM, befor that the shops are closed, there is a small coffee shop serves tea in old traditional way, good thing is that you can rent a Korean custom and walk in the village."
Unique and beautiful view ,"Over 900 hanok, traditional Korean houses in the middle of Seoul. It supposed to be the place where the royal family used to be live. A popular film location for movies and TV dramas."
A cultural place ,Really enjoyed the scenery at this village as it encompasses the traditional houses built during the Joseon dynasty. The area is really large and some of the houses are open for public viewing. 
Beautiful Hanok collections..,"it was a nice walk at 8am in the morning before tourists starts crowding the neighbourhood (we did not know that tourists are only allowed to visit after 10am, sorry)."
'Bukchon Hanok Village',"According to the 1906 data, it was a gathering place of houses of 'yangban' and bureaucrat.높은 곳에서 한옥들과 저 멀리있는 빌딩을 보고 있으면 묘한 기분이 든다.실제로 주거하시는 분들이 있으니 큰소리로 떠들거나 쓰레기 버리는 행위는 삼가시길.."
Time machine 600 years back to the streets of Korea,"If you’re into history and old traditional buildings, you should add Bukchon Hanok Village to your travel itinerary. Imagine yourself walking through the streets of Korea dating back 600 years. The houses are well maintained with various gift and coffee shops if you need a break from all the walking. If you’re into Instagram, this is where you get the iconic picture of the traditional streets of Korea. There are no cost to visit this destination. However, bring you’re tennis shoes as there’s lots of walking involved."
Beautiful old houses,It's an old valley with old houses that's still preserved til now. It's a residential area so the tourist can't make a loud noise but unfortunately some tourists can't understand that and stil make some noises.
Beautiful place with a view,"Beautiful place with a view!preserved in very good style! very much watched by tourists because for every building there is a sign ""do not enter"" the fact that people live there makes people find it more interesting!"
Peaceful,I really liked that the people hired to work here had one job: to keep things quiet. It made a world of difference. 
No. I sightseeing in Seoul,Buckchon meaning North Village is in fact a residential area with all those traditional Korean old houses. It’s amazing and looks like a film set. We managed to get hold of a map of the area and explored it on our own. There’s a few uphill streets to climb but well worth it.
Interesting and quiet ,"Had a nice Sunday walk around Bukchon Hanok Village. Being between the two palaces, you can do all three in the same day. Would come back and would recommend to friends. "
Nice walk to do,"Located very near the main palace, this old district of Seoul is interesting to visit. You will see traditional old houses and there is a nice view of the city from the top of the hill. "
Near the Gyeongbokgung Palace,"To have less awkward walk towards the village and Gyeongbokgung, better choose the hanok rental place near here. You need to be quite around this village to respect the people living in the area."
A walk to the past... 600 years ago,"A nice walk around the neighbourhood that preserve to showcase an urban environment 600 years ago. Wear Comfy shoes, be prepare to walk up hill! "
Interesting free walking tour ,Joined a free walking tour by the Seoul cultural organisation. The area has a lot of traditional restaurants and some specialty shops. This village is around 600 years old and still has some of the traditional Korean houses for homestay or visit. Quite an enjoyable walk with a nice view of the city and the palaces. I prefer shopping around this place than the famous Gangnam area where all the big international brands are. 
Nice and charming,"old renovated houses, but in a nice area, where you can have an idea how the people used to live. A house is open for the public viewing. "
Bukchon Hanok Village - A treasured heritage,This is a very well kept ancient village that was traditionally the residential quarter of high-ranking government officials and nobility during the Joseon Dynasty. It is a very pictureque place for photos as it is set on on small hill overlooking the fringe of the city.
Art & History,Rent a hanbok in here with a very cheap price. It was so nice to got to experienced walking around the 'village' while wearing a hanbok in a beautiful and artistic design of house and shops
More a precinct than a village.,"It was super fun to walk the narrow roads past beautiful buildings. Especially in Hanbok, which I highly recommend. It is up and down, so if you have knee problems it can be a little challenging. I had lunch at a great little restaurant and did some traditional sweet shopping. They have these lifesaver type lollies that whistle when you blow or suck through them. Entertaining and well annoying, but fun. I also did a Korean knot tying experience. It is really for beginners and available on a walk in basis. You get to choose from two types of bracelets, a key chain and two types of necklaces. Most of it is done for you, it is just a matter of choosing colours, and tying the macrame type knots. No Korean is needed as most have basic English. It was fun, but too simple for me. You can book a class for the more intricate knot projects. Which I will do next time. Just on the side, you sit on the ground, so with my dicky knees this was a little challenging. Also fun in Hanbok as it puffs out around you when seated."
"City views, narrow streets","Located not far from National Folk museum and royal palace. Visit the area if you want to experience anything different from steel, glass and concrete. Plenty of narrow streets going up and down, some houses are old, some are quite modern. Galleries, coffee shops, some places with a nice view from the top."
Average...,"I have brought my family to Japan, Indonesia and Thailand. This Bukchon Hanok Village is average compared to the other places my family has been. My kids took minimal photos..."
A very nice place to walk and take pictures ,This is a very nice place to visit and I like the architecture and the feeling there. It is still a residential area for the locals. I love to take pictures here. Except there are many tourists and hence lots of photo bombs ：）
Blast From the Past,Experience 600 years of history at this village. They have a lot of restos and ingenious shops and it's just nice to get lost on the alleys. You would certainly find something nice at any corner.
Just tourist attraction,This Hanok Village is pure tourist attraction without soul. Area consist several street or alleys with mostly new build look like old style buildings. I didn't really see point of this place? BTW. Hanok Village observation place is somebody's home at third floor. 
Nice stroll to observe traditional architecture,"We took the subway to Anguk station to Bukchon Hanok Village after visiting the Gyeongbokgung Palace and enjoyed an uphill stroll into the traditional village. All the homes are built as low rises with unique roofing characteristic of architecture from 600 years ago. Unless waiting for a unique photo opportunity of the horizon during sunrise or sunset, I would not spend too much time here as there isn't that much to see."
Explore the Traditional Korean residence,"Being close to the center of Seoul, There are many traditional Korean houses(Hanok). This village is definitely a must-visit Seoul attraction for its unique architecture and the traditional Korean streets.Before the trip, I heard that there would be too many people, which would ruin the scenery. So I chose to visit it before the sun rise and hoped to enjoy the golden hour of photography. There were only several people when I came to it, which save me a lot work when taking photos. Walking down the empty streets, I saw many traditional houses and found many unique features of the houses. Generally, the village is a wonderful place to explore the traditional Korean residence and a instagrammable photo location in Seoul."
A lovely traditional village,"This is a traditional village close by the centre of Seoul. Whilst it is quite nice to be able to walk around these traditional houses, it is clear that the hordes of tourists have ruined this area. There are guides around that make it clear you should not be disturbing the peace of the people who live there. However, it is a nice place to walk around as you will be able to get some awesome photos of the unique architecture of Seoul. If you get a chance to find them, there are lots of little tea shops around and you can enter to take a breather from walking around!"
Fascinating walk through a traditional neighbourhood,"Our guide was a retired military man, and he gave us a wonderful tour of this area. He was very knowledgeable, and was able to pass this on in an interesting way. I highly recommend Seoul City Walking tours, they truly are free and provide a great way to see the city."
Good trip,"Had a good experience walking and finding for this famous tourist spot. From the Angguk station it takes 15-20 mins to reach this place. Overall, it was a good trip. "
Nice Traditional Neighbourhood,Came on a quiet cold morning and there were plenty of photo opportunities. Just walk around to enjoy the views and soak in the atmosphere.
An interesting insight into traditional village ,We walked around this traditional Korean village. The area is vast and as such a lot to see. You will be able to see traditional Korean houses back in the olden days. Overall a nice area centrally located. You will also find a lot of locals and tourists dressed up in traditional Korean outfits. It’s a place kids will also enjoy walking around. 
Very interesting,I liked this village because of the old houses and relaxed atmosphere. Lots of little galleries and activities to stop at and learn more about the Korean culture and history.
A nice climb and use your Google Maps,"Lots of small shops while making the way up.You can use your google maps and it will lead you there. Great photo opportunity! 15min walk from Anguk Station. In case you get lost, shop owners are kind to show direction"
Good experience,"I took the subway and get off at Anguk station, exit 12 I believe?? I walked straight and saw the area that is Bukchon village. Once you get out from the exit and walk straight, that whole area is Bukchon village. To get to the main area, you must keep going straight and walk for another maybe 10-15 minutes until you see the CU convience store and then turn right. There, you would see a bunch of traditional Hanok houses, and it was very interesting. I recommend to come here, if you like to experience a traditional feeling of Korea. Around the area, there are things to do and see. You can experience many traditional arts and crafts, there are little shops in every corners for you to dive into, and immersed yourself into what you like to do. There are many restaurants and gift stores nearby too. Also, you can wear and rent traditional Hanbok and wear it, while you go around your business in seeing the Hanok village. Overall, it was a great experience, and I sure would go back."
"Very picturesque, so different","Very much enjoyed walking around. Very pretty, so many unusual doorways, locks etc to photograph, so I took lots of photographs, many enhanced by young people in traditional dress. Not to be missed. I felt sorry for the residents, as despite notices everywhere asking people to be quiet, not many people took any notice. With three days notice, you can get a free guided tour from a volunteer from Seoul city government.Can reach by Metro line 3 to Anguk, exit three"
Korean Houses,I think we just need 1 hour to explore this place. Only for photostop around the korean houses and there are many shop for rental hanbok and some souvenir shops
Pleasant neighborhood of traditional Korean houses,"A place where you’ll see a glimpse of Korean traditional houses called “hanok”. There are actually residents staying in the houses so tourists are advised to lower down their voices. It’s a steep walk so elderlies may tire walking up the lane..most of the houses have walls so you can only see the front gates or doors and rooftops.. if you’re in a tight schedule, you can skip this place."
interesting area of traditional houses and streets,"You can rent traditional dresses and visit the neighbourhood dressed with it. It is a very good idea. We saw very old and pretty houses, well renovated. And the area also offers stylish shops and restaurants which we visited during our 60 minutes there."
A place for your IG post,"It is good to know the infrastructures and culture of the old seoul but it is quite tiring to walk through the slopes, not really suitable for old people. Snaps some nice photo and have some tea at the tea house will do. "
Don't miss this place but respect the residents by keeping the noise low,"Bukchon Hanok Village is a quiet Korean traditional village. It has long history and composes of tight alleys, traditional yet beautiful houses. However, the village is still houses to many Koreans so there's a lot of signages requesting the tourists to keep the noise level down. Do also note that the alleys are quite steep so may not be suitable for the elderly to visit this place. Overall, a beautiful place to visit but remember to keep your noise level low."
Lovely Traditional Village,It was an amazing experience that you still could admire the traditional architect of old Korean houses. The village is a residential place with many lovely souvenir shops and tea houses. Be quiet and respect people who live here.
a different kind of experience,"Bukchon village is a very different kind of experience - puts a smile on your face. Narrow streets with cute houses, very different from other tourist spots one will visit. This is a residential area and these are peoples' homes, so please be respectful and quiet. We are glad we went there."
"Beautiful, quiet village","I took the subway to go to Bukchon Hanok Village. Stopped at Anguk station and walked around 300m to reach the village. This is where you can find hundreds of beautiful traditional houses which date back to the Joseon dynasty. These traditional houses operate as guesthouses, restaurants, tea houses, and souvenir shops. A good place for a calming evening stroll."
Worth the visit,We took the subway here which was very convenient. This is a nice little neighborhood that has kept the old traditional architecture which is a nice change from the modern high rises of Seoul. There are some houses that are open to the public but keep in mind to take off your shoes and to be respectful to the residents by keeping voices low. There are plenty of public restrooms which are surprisingly clean. Worth the visit!
Pleasant walk,Visited the Bukchon Hanok village on a cold Friday afternoon. We enjoyed the very pleasant walk through the sands of time. Nice friendly shopkeepers along the way too. We really loved the views of old Seoul juxtaposed against views of modern Seoul in the background. A must see. 
Visiting a 600 year old urban environment,This is a place where visitors should visit. It has a very long history and located in between Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung. This village was traditionally the residential quarter of high-ranking government officials and nobility during the Joseon Dynasty.
A hint of cultural history with a mix of modernity,"It was pretty nice seeing the people were able to preserve the styles of their houses, and the vibe of the street even though south korea is a first world country. Fitted along antique doors however, are electronic doorbells and other high tech gate control systems, which parks the residents' kia and hyundai vehicles."
Don't go out of your way,"It's a village with actual people living there. There is nothing to do besides taking pictures, and the village is actually pretty little so don't expect to stay here for long."
Boring but a Must See,"Not as exciting as I hoped it would be, but it was December and the middle of Winter, which also made it unpleasant.The architecture and village layout is fascinating, but unless we missed the right spots and location, there was not much to see.Please research before you go."
Seeing bukchon on pedicab,"Well, touring Bukchon on pedicab is quite interesting but seeing the young chap peddling so hard somehow made you feel a little awkward. It’s not cheap so I hope he is well rewarded for his hard work.Apart from that feeling, seeing the village on pedicab is quite enjoyable! You could see things in slow pace as the “cab” weaving through the alleys where cars are not allowed!"
Interesting Tour,Toured the village with a group of students. They provided some interesting tidbits on the buildings. Generally all you can see is the outside of the entire village as the area is actually the homes of the local population. Interesting visit but nothing spectacular.
well preserved and informative tour,we toured this village and went thru the whole village with its peaceful courtyard. we learnt of its history. highly recommend 
Korean Tour,"Back to old times. Enjoy the ambience of old Korean dynasty, old houses are well maintained and be quiet when roaming around because its a residential area"
Traditional beauty of Korea,"Please feel the traditional beauty of Bukchon Hanok Village, where people still live. And please refrain from any action that interferes with their lives."
Good sightseeing place,"I don’t think have to write long review for this place since Bukchon is one of the most tourist spot in Seoul. Tips from me that you have to come here earlier if want to take many pictures because this place will be very crowded if you came later. Also, please be quiet. There’s some places also not allowed you to take a picture so mind the sign."
A Glimpse of the Past,"A hilly neighborhood with hundreds of traditional houses or hanoks bating back to Joseon Dynasty, this Bukchon Village which is in the north-central part of Seoul lies between Gyeongbok and Changdeok Palace. Though most of these Hanoks have been converted into tea houses, restaurants or guest house, art galleries, some are still held privately. Lot of efforts have gone into these hanoks to keep the original form intact. The village also has an old well called Seokjeong Full Moon well which in ancient times was the main source of water for the entire village. It is believed that this well provided clear good drinking water only for fifteen days and unclear water for the next fifteen days. The village women is said to have also believed that drinking this water helped them to bear a male child.Not to be missed, the attraction requires lot of walking so for those your are regular walkers may find it a bit difficult here.This place can be easily reached thru the city bus or metro. The visit to this place can also be clubbed along with G Palace."
Bukchon Wanderings,"This is a picturesque neighbourhood where a large cluster of privately owned traditional Korean houses has been well preserved for a long period. The village used to be an upscale residential area for wealthy aristocrats and court employees. The traces of old roads and waterways, as well as the stones and timber dwellings, rewind the present to centuries long past. The village has retained it's original shape and feature historical sites and cultural properties that tell the history of Joseon and modern Korea."
A glimpse of history in Seoul. ,Reachable via metro orange line and off at Anguk station and about 10-15 minutes walk north and you won’t miss the place. It’s crowded and hard to take a good photo but if you’re lucky it’s a nice nostalgic place especially if you’re wearing their traditional hanbok dress! Be Very careful when you rent the dress since every additional ornament is chargeable. People are warned not to make to much noise since the place is actually residential but most tourists can’t resist making loud voices! It is advisable to come here during week days to avoid over crowding. 
"Too crowded, save up and visit Jeonju for better experience.","The place is too crowded and you cannot make too much noises, because its a village of private houses!It is very easily reached from Insadong trip, walking about 10 -15minutes from there. The village is not big, but walking uphill of the village was worth it as you get to see some beautiful scenery too.Overall, you guys should visit Jeonju Hanok Village instead."
Quick photo ,"Maybe because there were just too many tourists when we were there to take any nice photos. However, still interesting to know that these traditional houses actually have residents staying inside. "
Nothing really fantastic ,"If you do have extra time, you may consider visiting this place, otherwise I do not feel it is really worth the visit. It was just a stretch of houses which resembled the ancient time. Time spent there is around 15-30mins"
Worth a visit if you come to Korea,"Old heritage house built hundred years ago . Close to the palace where still have the residents live in. Good location for many tourists to change to korean costume and take picture in this village. Nothing really big deal to me once you have visited to china. However, too many through out the year and hard to talk a good pictures in my view.. "
Walking trail to see traditional house,"You get to spend approx 1.5-2hrs to see local traditional houses.Besides, you can rent the Hanok from the shops and take some nice photos.Along the way, you can get see the high school featured in goblin Korean drama "
Nice area to visit and walk around,"Great area to visit and walk around. Really pretty and close to the Gyeongbokgung Palace, Insa Dong and Jogyesa temple. Great free activity and would allow 30 min - 1 hour to walk around."
Wonderful place to explore ,"Do take your time to explore the neighborhood. Wonderful architecture and feel of the place is amazing. Plenty of nice eateries. But do be respectful as you walk around the residential area. People still do stay in those houses. Being Respectful includes not talking at the top of your voices. Seriously, no one enjoys having so many tourists /outsiders thronging your front yard whole day long.. "
Convenient location for quick snaps,"There are multiple Hanok Villages scattered across Seoul. This was a convenient stop for us as it's near the downtown palaces and a ~20 minute walk to my hotel. Getting to the top most vantage point is quite a steep vertical climb, and footfall here is high. Many tourists will invade the residents' front porches to take photos for the 'gram, such that the residents have put up CCTVs and signs to protect their privacy. There's another on the Seoul City Bus Tour that may be more comfortable and convenient to get to. The architecture there also seemed nicer there from street view."
Lovely architecture,"Great place, unique architectureEnjoyed the visit, people wearing local costumes.Enjoyable trip! Rafael"
Nice Afternoon Walk,"Great place to spend a few hours strolling. Do try to get away from the crowds a bit as the scenery becomes much more enjoyable. Also, while not all visitors will be, it is best to be as courteous and quiet as you can as this is a neighborhood and not Time Square. "
A vintage vibe of Seoul,Best to stroll in this area in the afternoon for a quiet shopping or coffee time. Loved the vibe!! Recommended for the down times of your trip.
Nice to experience Korean tea and items.,"Just walk along the road deep inside the Village.You will find traditional Korean tea houses, restaurants, and item shops.However, be aware of the residents. They dislike too loud voice."
Heritage Visit,Went to Bukchon and be amamzed bybthe traditional houses still situated in the city. A lot of famous korean dramas and movies are made there as the palace is still well maintained. Nice sunset if you go at the right time. 
Give them a break please,"The village has nice traditional Korean houses. However, they are suffering from tourism. The houses are mostly occupied but families living in them. But tourists are not letting them live happily and with privacy. There are signs by the residents (see photos) indicating that they are suffering. There are signs on most doors asking people to not open doors/knock on them. There are also staff with yellow vests asking tourists to be quiet as they visit the village. Yet, I witnessed so many people talking loudly, knocking on doors and trying to go inside, and many other disturbing behaviors. This is unsustainable and unethical tourism. There are many other places in Korea where you can find that style of architecture. Do yourself and the village a favor and skip this place - let the locals live. I would’ve skipped if I was aware of this problem."
Charming,Strolled through the village following a recommended walking tour provided by a tourist info center. Charming traditional houses. You could go inside a couple of them. Some areas with shopping & restaurants. Many people wandering about in traditional Korean dress added to the experience
Definitely worth a visit,"This is a village with traditional houses beautifully conserved. These are both owner-occupied as well as converted into shops selling jewellery, souvenirs and restaurants. You can also get a walking map of the Bukchon Hanok Village from the tourist centre nearby. Definitely worth a visit. Do note that the elderly and those who have difficulty in walking will find this place challenging. "
"Picture perfect, just be quiet and respectful","People actually live here, so it's best to mind your manners and your volume. If you reside here, you wouldn't be pleased with noisy uninvited tourists either.If you have time, check out the Baek In-Je House Museum. It's worth the time and it's free (with clean toilets by the entrance)."
I love this neighborhood ,"I have visited this area about 5 times. I just love the boutiques, the dining is great. One finds beautiful little stores with wonderful items from great shoes, coats, scarfs to tea and coffee places. In addition the Village delights the visitors with ancestral architecture. I just love this place!"
Tour trip,A nice photographic view of traditional Hanok houses. Not allowed to make noise as this is still housing area to some. 
Probably glorious without tourism infrastructure ,"Well-maintained and surely different from 'Seoul' but crowded with boutique fashion shops, coffee bars and such taking away the charm of an ancient place. "
Bukchon Hanok village is limited Hanok houses,Bukchon Hanok village is confined to just 2 streets of main bukchon. It is limited Hanok houses as compared to Jeonju Hanok village which is world UNESCO site. Some of these houses are converted to guest houses for rent.
Lovely historical architecture in seoul,I enjoy visiting bukchon hanok village when in Seoul. It is easily accessible from anguk train station. Though be aware that there is a lot of walking in some quite steep areas. People live and work in these houses so in the evening they have staff posted asking the many tourists to please be quiet. At one part there is a street if interesting stalls and eating places . A lot of people dress in national costume to take photos here and a lot of wedding photos are also take here. Take your time and wear good walking shoes and visit some or all of the open dwellings whilst meandering throhgn
A taste of old Seoul,This is a residential area in Seoul and one should have that in mind when visiting the place. It is made of small private homes with history boasting 600 years. The houses are small made with wood and stone on a very peculiar architectural style. Some were turned into small restaurants and coffee shops giving you a chance to see the inside of the houses. Some locals wearing yellow jackets can help you through the narrow streets. The visit should not take long and it is definitely a spot you should not miss.
Lovely houses but overcrowded,"Well there are some really nice old houses in the area, but there are hundreds of tourists as well. As the area consists of just some little streets it is absolutely overcrowded. There are several people from the tourist bureau holding up signs „quiet please“ because it is a residential area and people do live here. Well, I am sure on one hand it is an expansive neighborhood, but I would not love to have a house in those streets with hundreds of tourist passing by each day.So basically: as described by someone else already: overrated, not really worth to go."
Beauty in Silence,"We were told to make little to no noise as we ascend our way up the village. If you are a fan of K-dramas like me, then you would definitely see some familiar sights. Posters of no loud talking, and proper waste disposals were plastered everywhere. Our guide told us, that residents from this area got annoyed at first because tourists came barging in disturbing their everyday flow. It is one of the country's villages that was preserved and protected by the Korean government. So as a win-win solution, tourists are allowed to the village with the condition to respect the rules set by the residents. The village is closed every Sunday to allow the villagers to enjoy their private space. I really love how it is incorporated in the modernity of its surroundings. You will not also go hungry and thirsty on your way up because there are food stalls in the area. Really worth seeing!"
Nice place for korean drama,Here this place for many many korean drama shooting... very famous for everyone... you can see beautiful scenery about palace etc from up up here... you can rent hanbok if you want... with local house that you can use to take photo
Overrated ,"Although it is considered as an iconic historical dite in Seoul, the truth is that this street is quite overrated, crammed with tourist, and the people living in this area are so tired of tourist visiting this street that they have posted “keep quiet” and “do not come in” signs all over the street.The whole visit is uphill so, if taking a stroller or wheelchair along for the ride keep this in mind.The ice cream shop at the first turn of the street, near the entrance, is quite good."
It’s cool I guess,"Worth going if you just want to see some old houses in Korea, but if you’re in Korea for a while you should go to Jeonju instead. That’s a whole town full off old school houses, this is two streets. Nice streets, though! "
Good for strolling,"You probably know what you're expecting to see when you get here. We also came here to shop at Gentle Monster's flagship store at Gyedong-gil. The store has been converted from a bathhouse. They have preserved the history by merging the design. Tiled floors, bathtubs and the fragrance!! Must visit and shop at if you're a Gentle Monster fan!"
A place to kill time ,It’s a good place to go if you want to wonder and browse. There’s plenty of food options in the area. If you’re short on time you could give this place a miss. 
A beautiful architectural traditional part of Seoul,A really lovely area in Seoul where you have traditional Korean architecture.A wonderful place to go for shopping and eating. We just strolled about and tried out some of the superb Korean bakeries.Easy to get to on the metro.
Old folk village,A nice place to see because it is surrounded by high rise building. Hanok village is a traditional korean house. You can feel korean tradition in this place. 
free admission,This showcase village depicts ancient korean life with mannequins in an old setting. It's free admission but the entrance is a bit difficult to find. We stumbled upon it.
Traditional Neighborhood that felt Touristy!,"I really enjoyed my time wandering the streets at Bukchon Hanok Village, but I felt it was a little to touristy. There were crowds of people walking up the hill to get here, and shops near the entrance, with groups walking all over the place. Sometimes, I actually felt bad for the people that live in this village. Put that aside, the majority of the small houses here were traditional and cute. Some of the hills and alley ways were a climb, but made for great photo opportunities. I did not have a plan and just walked around the village looking at the interesting architecture. This village is well worth a visit, but don't treat it like a tourist destination."
A bit gentrified but still worth visiting,.... great to eat stuff but stuff. Look at stuff. There is an amazing traditional woodworking museum round the corner up the hill close to palace. Not on the map but great!!!!!
Seoul Traditional Korean Village,If you are in Seoul you should take some time to visit this Bukchon Hanok Village. You can get a taste of how the history of Korean architecture of their homes
Beautiful Traditional Village,"I visited the Bukchon Hanok Village to experience the traditional Korean Houses which are said to be well-preserved over 600 years. It was an amazing experience as you can still appreciate the traditional architecture of old Korean houses first-hand. But I have to warn you that the route is quite hilly and sometimes you can get ""lost"" if you are not mindful enough. But the real challenge is its hilly path. If you are up for an adventure and is fit enough, this is a must visit place in Seoul. To go there just take Subway Line 3 (Orange Line) and alight at Anguk Station and use Exit 3. It will take you there."
A nice maze like village to get lost in. Quiet please!,"This is still a residential area for the locals, so we should respect that and be mindful how 'noisily excitable 'one can be when in throes of wonderment of the beautiful and authentic style of yesteryear homes. These are quite amazing to look at and a good area to get lost in. Unfortunately, precisely because it is a residential area, there are no public facilities ( other than the shops). Good for a half day walking tour."
The most beautiful neighborhood in Seoul ,No visit to Seoul would be complete without a stroll through the Bukchon Hanok Village. Wander through the hilly neighborhood and imagine what it was like walking in Seoul hundreds of years ago. You can rent Hanbok (traditional Korean formal dress) for both sexes at numerous rental places nearby to wear for a few hours or a day to enhance your Bukchon Hanok Village experience. The best photo opportunity is at the top of the hill. It will be obvious where that is once you ascend the hill. At the top of the hill you’ll see handmade signs leading you to the “Bukchon Overlook”. This is not an official overlook but simply an older gentleman who charges admission to look out from his top floor about 6 stories up. He serves you a drink and there are some nice photo opportunities so it is worth the 3000 won IMO. He also has a cute parrot. I got a kick out of his business acumen because he does attract numerous tourists. 
A quaint walk,"If you have the time, make sure to walk through Bukchon Hanok Village. The houses are absolutely beautiful and you feel as though you have been transported to hundred of years ago.While there, also be on the lookout for restaurants serving traditional Korean food. They are the best finds!But please be conscious that there are people living in this area so to please keep your voice low and other noise at a minimum. "
Nice ,Yeah our tour guide took us here and it was great to see how the old houses were built and you have to great view of the city 
A disappointment,"This was my third trip to Seoul and first visit to the Bukchon Hanok Village. As I walked through tne neighborhood, I saw the banners of the residents living in the area and felt a great deal of sympathy toward them. I felt like an intruder! We did visit one restored mansion in the area. A lot of the shops and small galleries were closed for lunch time. While it was picturesque to see many tourists dressed in hanbok, I felt I did not have a deep cultural experience."
Beautiful old houses,"Bukchon Hanok Village is a residential place with beautiful old houses. It is quite a walk from the train station and still an uphill walk to see the houses. Walking there, you'll pass by mamy shops with interesting souvenirs and other items. You can also rent a traditional outfit for a little cost.There were several tea houses in the village.The houses were beautiful and reminiscent of the olden times. It just feels quite wrong to walk around a village where private people still actually live. Tourists are not too welcome there, as evident in the signs around.We stayed for less than 10 minutes and left."
Truly Tourist Photo Spot,"I love the cleanliness of bukchon area. You can easily find a good spot to take a picture. Get your phone or camera and take a selfie You can rent hanbok, a traditional Korean dress with 12K - 15K WON for an hour and feel like a truly Korean But remember dont make any noise coz actually this village is residential area.Not far from this area you can find many cafes and restaurant where you can eat to fill your empty stomach after strolling around the area or just have a cup of coffee or tea to reboost your energy."
Beautiful south korean atmosphere,We appreciate walking through the streets of the village and visting the traditional houses. we did it withto a guide from seoul city for free and it was really interesting to understand how south Korean used to live.Nice photos from there. Recommend it during a stay in seoul
Nice to have a walk,It is nice and cute to walk in the little streets. Nice artshops in the area.However after 1hr you have seen everything.
Bukchon village,Its a very nice and little village of Bukchon where you can still see houses of the old times. Stroll along the streets of bukchon village and take a beautiful picture around
Very sweet,"Well worth a walk around this area. As people live there, you must be quiet. Really liked the architecture. Easy to find. "
Beautiful Place for Photos,"Very nice place for photos of Seoul, definitely recommended this place for soaking in the Korea atmosphere here. There is also shops for u to rent the traditional korean gown to take photos around with quality gown and cheap price. MUST NOT MISS!"
Picturesque village,"My friends and I visited Bukchon Hanok Village last year. The place is so picturesque. Of course by wearing the Korean traditional hanbok, we can blend in with area well "
Hanok Village!,Village that is picture perfect. Careful that you should be a little quiet while entering this premises because there are actually residentials living there.
There's a protest going on and there's too many tourist,"We went there after visiting Gyeongbokgung and I must say it's not what I have in my mind. The place was full with tourist and there's a protest from the resident. It says that you have to keep quiet and I think I'll also join the protest if I live in the neighbor. It's still fun to see the houses, but not fun if it's full of people"
Traditional Old Homes ,A good place to take pictures but mainly along a few alley and a main. Saw a couple taking a wedding shot there. Keep quite as the locals dislike the noise tourist makes.
traditional homes,We enjoyed walking through the streets of the village and seeing the traditional houses. We appreciated the presence of tourist information officers who guided us and even gave us a map to find restaurants. 
Old town ,Pretty houses to look at and take pictures. I would not say it is a must do. But if you are visiting the palace near by you might aswell pop by.
Beautiful Village,Beautiful village indeed to walk around. But please keep your voices down around this residential area. You definitely won't like flocks of noisy people at your door front everyday. I heard that the residences there actually requested their government to ban tourists from entering that area due to some rude tourists actually go knocking the doors and entering their premises without permission.Please behave so that more people can enjoy the beautiful walkways of Bukchon. 
Spectacular Area,The village is best accessible by walking from Gyeongbokgung Palace and roaming around the nearby streets. It was a wonderful experience to get lost in the dizzying streets and finally reaching your final destination of Bukchon Hanok.Take your time in roaming around the village away from the tour groups. Best to experience walking around in silence.
Many school trips,"When we visited there were many buses taking student on trips here. So it’s a good place to learn about Korean culture and way of living in the past, because it’s even popular among the locals. A drama was being filmed at the village, there aren’t many tourists (few) according to our guide tourists visit the Palace more. I only didn’t enjoy the equestrian show - I don’t like shows with animals in it (personal opinion). But the farmers drums and dance was good. "
the best in seoul ,"well this is my best place when going in seoul , habitants are suffering from tourist so better be quiet while visiting the street .... "
Always nice,Always nice to walk but it does get very crowded nowadays... Lots of tour groups. Nevertheless I love walking up from Anguk side and finishing in Samcheongdong.
Attractive place,"Bukchon is the natural link between two palaces and therefore a natural stop over. Rich in small exhibitions, artworks, old historical houses. Plenty of cafes, small shops and restaurants. Go for it!"
Renting hanbok and taking pic here ,Wearing hanbok and taking pics here bring you to the olden days . Although this place is not huge. If you want to have a whole town with this kind of building. Do go to jeongju
Nice stroll with old village style,"Actually, once you have exit from Anguk station exit 3, it is consider bukchon hanok village. This is what the nice local mobile volunteers told us & gave us a map. Nice scenery but a bit taxing on your legs, especially if you have been walking for the past 5 days as there are a lot of uphills & downhills. Very hard to spot the photo op as per recommended. It would be great if they could put up a sign to mention this spot is for photo! Sigh"
Art village with lots of restaurants,Is was advertised that it is open until 9:00 PM so by the time I arrived at 6:30 PM most of the local artist studios were closed. But the main road has dozens of restaurants and other food establishments open. Come earlier!
Wear comfortable shoes ,"This is actually a residential area of the locals, you will see some aunties standby at the road side to make sure every visitors are keeping their voice down and not to distribute the residents. Some road ups and downs so wear comfortable shoes because it actually involved a lot of walking including slopes and downhill road. There are shops provide renting of traditional Korean costumes, it is indeed a nice place to take photos with the costumes on."
Nice walk ,Seems like place where artisans like to set up shop. Unfortunately I was unable to explore further as there was a heavy downpour. 
A great walk at this place ,"There is not much to see here, but it's a great walk around this area.After you see the palace which is closeby, you can then visit this attraction. "
Traditional Korean Village,A traditional Korean village inside the city. They have preserved the heritage. You have to walk up and you can take photo with the headless traditional figurines n front of the village!
Nice place,I think this is a nice place to go once time but I think this's enough for me. I dont think this is the old village. That's the new village build by the old style.
Perfect spot,This old village is a perfect spot to see the city on the horizon during the sunset!There is a bit of climb to reach it but is totally worthy.
Traditional old houses,"We stayed in a guesthouse in the village, so had the opportunity to wander the streets both at night and during the day. Lovely traditional old houses and craft experiences and many many coffee shops! It is primarily still a residential area and the majority of visitors were being respectful and keeping the noise down, although you can see why some residents are less welcoming to tourists! For the best photos, you need to be there early in the morning (before 10)."
Heritage view but...,"We have spend too much walking on the first 2 day hence not really enjoy the view here. The scenic is nice if taking picture with Hanbok. Else it just a tourist place with some many selfie stick on your photo session. But, a short walk after lunch is nice."
Good afternoon walk,"Great for leisure walks, there are different activities offered. You can rent Korean dresses and walk around the village. "
Heritage village,"The Hanok Village is an old heritage village. There are a few very old houses remaining.The village is a 20 minute walk from the Palaces and Museum .The area has become very commercial with a lot of modern ""made in Korea "" shops and a lot of restaurants.A good way to spend the afternoon ."
Traditional Korean Houses,"The village is located about 10-15 min walk from Anguk station. The station itself is one of the most artistic station I have ever visited in Seoul. I must say that the village is a good place to get to know Korean heritage through its traditional houses (you must know that some people still live inside those houses). There is this one house that you can enter so that you can experience living like a Korean. For those who loves learning about different culture, this is the place to be !"
Community with an old charm. Just be quiet!,"The narrow streets and traditional roof design gives you a feel of an old Korean community, perhaps of the nobility class because of the house sizes and hilly location. Because of the large number of tourists who flock this area, the community is less welcoming as shown in their street banners/signs Tourist guides also warn tourists not to talk loudly so as not to disturb residents. Still worth visiting."
Beautiful neighbourhood to visit,"A really beautiful neighborhood with lots and lots of traditional style deigned houses on a steep hill slope. This is actually a residential neighborhood so visitors are requested to keep the noise down you will see people holding signs advising visitors to respect the residents and not make noise.The village basically opens to the public at 10am at which time I am told lots and lots of coachloads of tourists arrive and the place changes into a busy and bustling area. Fortunately I left me hotel in the very early morning and arrived there shortly after sunrise when there were zero tourists. However, actually visitors are not meant to be here so early but I was alone and making no noise at all.Along the many lanes can be seen beautiful architecture with ornate roofs and wood details. Views of Seoul Tower can often be seen in the distance. This is definitely a fantastic place to visit and should not be missed."
Beautifull place to visit,"Hanok village is beautiful, you have to be silent because people live there, and obviously quite rich people, so you are not allowed to disturb them "
Beautiful,It was so nice to see traditional houses of South Korea. It's well worth visiting and in a really nice area of Seoul. Lots of nice restaurants around too. Highly recommended.
Neighborhood,"Neighborhood that has a right to limit the tourists. After wandering for an hour and seeing the area overrun by tourists and tour groups, I feel sorry for the locals. To experience the Hanok Village there are better when you won’t be a bother to people trying to live their lives."
Neat Area,"Went here to check out the traditional architecture, definitely enjoy checking out the area! Enjoyed seeing what a traditional village would look like. There are a few different shops, didn't find it crowded and its a decent enjoyable walk."
Lovely area for wandering,"This area is a short walk from the Gyeongbokgung Palace and can easily be combined with a trip there. There are many interesting little back streets with craft centres, workshops, ceramic shops, and traditional architecture, as well as plenty of places to eat. Do visit and see another side of Seoul."
traditional,Very traditional houses surround this area.Take 1-2 hours waking around here without any destination.Enjoy the houses and atmosphere here.這個地方有很多傳統的房屋。花個一到兩個小時在這邊沒有目的地與目的性地亂走，好好享受這邊的房屋與氛圍。
A Homey Village,"When I was here, I felt like I traveled back in time. The village is very homey too. There are nice like shops and I get to wear a Hanbok."
great little shops lovely people,I loved making the silver pendents the shop is just at the top of this road on the right side. Have a nice wonder enjoy
Normal traditional village,Nothing much to explore here imo as everywhere sells basically the same things. All you could do there is to take pictures and enjoy the building styles? 
old village,It is most famous Korean old villege in the city center.It is live town. You can see the how was the people living and how is now.there are many shops and many thing to eat.you can enjoy there.
One favourite,"Loved walking around this suburb. Charming traditional houses, galleries, art & craft shops, fashion.You can obtain a local map from the information volunteers around (dressed up in red) or walk around. "
Step back in time!,"This is a lovely place to reflect on the past while respectfully walking the streets. As this is a residential area, it is very important to remain respectful and quiet while visiting their neighborhood.Near the neighborhood are little shops and stops where you can look for souvenirs or grab a bite to eat."
Charming Village !,"Lovely charming village with lots of photo opportunities. Bring you away from the city of Seoul back to the old traditional houses of Seoul. Very residential, thus should be sensitive of one's surroundings when walking around. First stop - go the Bukchon Traditional Cultural Centre to understand the past and present of Bukchon Hanok Village and get a walking guide map. Follow the walking guide on the map and it will bring you to many lovely finds.Be prepared with lots of walking and go with a pair of good walking shoes to go upslope, steps and down-hill.Throughly enjoyed the visit !"
good place for strolling at evening with beautiful houses,"is great place, really. but i only give 3 rating due to this area is residential, not really some place u can go as you like. at first, i was though this is a heritage site but in fact this is a residential area, it make me shocked. hard to imagine i living in a house where there is a ton of people walking around my house everyday looking (peeking) into my house. so, it is really a great place, but please be considered to visit this place due to privacy problems."
Old World Charm,"Crossing the street to this area transports you to another world. Slow, prim, old world charming. Enjoy the small stores around"
day tour ,was there with hyeyoung ...lovely place lots of tiny shops and alleyways great place for photo opportunities ...but keep in mind that it’s still a residential area and people remind you to keep it low!!!!!a couple of hours are possible if you plan to have lunch there ...would be apprehensive for people with knee back problems as the rounds are a tad steep !!! comfy shoes are a must !!nice places to enjoy coffee or lunch 
Fabulous ,Best place to take photos in Seoul as it is very beautiful. It has strong Korean feel and its a pleasant walk for tourists.a must visit when you’re visiting Seoul! 
Wonderful place to visit ,This seems to be the only place where you can get a sense of tradition now that Insadong has been ruined. We wandered the alleys looking at the beautiful buildings. There are buildings you can visit and nice places to stop for tea. A must see. 
Be prepared to walk,I loved Bukchon Hanok... it can make you travel in time. But be ready to walk into sloping streets. Definitely worth the exercise.
old street,"walk along these streets and the rustic feel welcomes you. Thought i assume some or most of these houses have been revamped recently, the rustic feel is still there. clean and fresh feeling."
moody and traditional,"it’s good to walk around:)there’s lots of small shops and great Hanok.It was so impressive I think, and I do recommand you to go here "
Private & quiet village,"A place for old korean houses. You'll have to walk the stiff hill just to get to the top. However this place have restricted tourist from entering already because homeowners no longer want their village to be disturbed. So no longer interesting, but below the place/village there are still some restos & shops"
A pleasant place to wander round,"Rated highly as a must do but I didn't really understand what all the fuss is about. Bukchon Hanok village is a pleasant place to explore for an hour or so. The house are pretty and situated on a number of steep hills, with a main street selling refreshments including some great non-dairy ice cream. The village does feel too touristy though and it's not that easy to photograph, unless you have a wide angle lense."
Be respectful,"While I believe that the area is well preserved and stunning architecturally, the atmosphere is kind of destroyed by the large posters saying, 'No Tourists'. Make sure you keep quiet, especially in the morning as the locals don't particularly want you there. Aside from that, it's a very beautiful and historic area of Seoul and I do believe you should visit."
Well preserved but locals disapproved,Local residents disapproved Bukchon become tourist attractions in Seoul because of the noise and damaging effect from tourist. Many houses isn't intended for tourist. Need to be very quiet when visiting this place.
You need strong legs to visit all 8 scenes!,"Beautiful traditional Hanok village but very hilly! You need strong legs, good walking shoes and lots and lots of water!"
Very touristic ,Nice to see and ok for half day - yet too commercialized and full of shops ... logistics is good and helpful info points are everywhere — is a should do when visiting Seoul 
Amazing,It’s a definite must on your trip to Seoul. Please be respectful and quite as it is a neighbourhood. We rented costumes and it was hot so we sweated the whole time. But it made a few memorable photos. 
Traditional Korean's House for your insta feed.,"This place offer an authentic Korean's House that will be a great feed for your album. If you have time, wearing hanbok will be advantage :)"
Good experience,Strolling in this area was my best experience ever. And you know what? Every single picture taken here was so nice. I love the scenery. 
Traditional village in the heart os Seoul,I spent a half day wandering the streets and lanes of this beautiful village. A great place to just wander and get lost to experience traditional Korean buildings and homes. Be prepared for a few steep hills.
Traditional houses in modern times,It's amazing how they managed to keep the traditional houses. It's like you have traveled back in time. What's even better is if you are wearing a hanbok. You will truly belong. 
I wish I could stay here forever,"Bukchon Hanok Village is a Korean traditional village located adjecent to Gyeongbokgung Palace. Great place to find Korean architecture with no entrance fee. It was peaceful to walk and explore the narrow streets of Bukchon and view from the top was just magical. There are shops were you could rent korean traditional dresses. Guesthouses are available for rent within the village. You may visit the traditional craft experience centre and attend the workshop with a small participation fee. As it is a residential area therefore, strict policy on noise and littering needs to be followed.Visiting hours are restricted to 10 am to 5 pm Mon - Sat Quick Tip: Make sure to wear comfortable shoes as the sight is pretty hilly and takes couple of hours to explore it entirely."
My favourite neighbourhood in Korea,"This is an area where people live in. Nothing commercial hence respect the neighbours when visiting. Shhhhhhh... there are, somehow, a lot of rude tourists who would chat loudly and walk in to people’s homes. "
Lovely place ,"We visited during the cool autumn weather . We walked through the traditional village wearing their traditional Korean costume . With all the awesome backdrop for the photos , it was an awesome experience! "
Amazing but sad to visit,"This village is beautiful and worth a visit. But it is so crowded that the people living there seem to be tired of tourists. There are signs all over the village saying No tourists are welcome, Keep out, Silence please etc. In a way I understand that since it’s like the people are living in a tourist attraction. "
Try to spend a night here ,Very well preserved historical village. Lots of selfie opportunities together with hundreds of other tourists. Try to spend a night here in one of the traditional house. It is memorable. 
A village like no other,"If I could, I would get myself a house there. It was nestled in those uphills with unique designs. The houses looked old but with a touch of modernism. Make sure you go visit it. But please, be silent while admiring this gem. "
It becomes more modern..,"In my imagine , Bukchon Hanok is ancient village ( as Old architectures something ) . It was modernized by all new painted walls and become a tourist spot . Nothing i found is exceptional here :)ㅠㅠ one tip : if you had a good camera, wear hanbok and pose thousand of photos by your ways :) "
Traditional Korean houses,A residential and tourist area full of Hanok (Korean traditional houses). Good place to take picture in Hanbok (Korean traditional clothing)
Be considerate to respect the residents,"After reading some guide books I have made this village a priority in my Seoul itinerary because this is a real village resided by real residents. Only when I read some TA reviews about real residents don't like interruptions by tourists did I start to hesitate. But our Korean friend who lives in Seoul said it's ok to visit during daytime on a weekday so off we go.A few alleys on a small hill make up the village. Two alleys are particularly pretty, and thus full of tourists. Yes there are signs asking visitors to keep quiet, some even say do not take pictures of the house or touch the door. I think this is understandable because this is a real neighborhood. I may do the same if I live there.I only took pictures from a little distance away instead of leaning on someone else's door. Nonetheless, I enjoyed a quiet stroll to admire the very well maintained hundreds years old traditional houses and soak in the atmosphere.Be considerate and enjoy!"
Nice look into Korea's history,"We took on Bukchon Hanook on our hop on hop off bus tour. Was a lovely look into an ancient style village. Be aware this is a replica village, for some reason at first we thought it was a real village lol. Definitely Worth a look though. You can see a Taekwondo demonstration at about 1pm."
Beautiful Hanok architecture,This is a must visit place for someone visiting the city. Beautiful traditional architecture where you can probably shoot one of the best photos in the city. Don't forget to stay quiet as this is a residential area!
Keep very quiet here,Lovely hanoks to admire but it’s good to be really quiet so as not to disturb the residents living there. If we put ourselves in the shoes of the residents we wouldn’t want our day to day life to be disturbed by tourists either. 
Peter G,"Very interesting original buildings demonstrating the history and architecture, if you really look in detail some amazing artisan drawings and local needlework can be purchased "
Lovely arty area to walk around,"We took a free of charge walking tour, from Seoul walking tours. We met at Unhyeongung Palace at 10.00 hrs. Spent some time in the Palace then walked up to the village, lots of nice tradditional houses and street views, bit hilly.......but you do need to work off your holiday food. Lots of art places, and good value restaurants. Lots of Koreans in traditional dress. Rained while we were there, dont bother with a rain coat get an umbrella like the locals."
Great Historical Area,The village has been very well maintained. It is a great place to walk around and see the Hanok houses. An easy walk from the two main palace attractions. 
They don’t like tourists,"It is uphill streets lined with traditional houses. It was nice to take pictures of the traditional houses. If you visit here, be aware that the residents strongly discourage the presence of tourists. They see them as a nuisance. So please be quiet when you are here. There is a hanbok rental shop at the beginning of the street. "
Empty,"i dont know if there was anything else going on when i went but the was hardly anyone around, which made for a really nice relaxing atmosphere as apposed to a crowded crazy one. the area is so nice and the small cafes and shops were all really cute too~!"
Nice but touristy spot ,The Hanok-village Bukchon is a traditional korean village in between the skyscrapers of Seoul an right next to the Gyeongbokgung palace. It‘s nice to walk around and see the traditional housing there. You can rent a Hanbok there and with this you‘ll get free admission to the palace.
Make Sure You Have A Guide! ,"When visiting the Hanok Village, it is almost necessary to have a guide take you around! The hanok village is actually a residential neighborhood, and from what we learned, in recent years, the residents have not been happy with the increase in tourists visiting the area. The neighborhood is actually completely restricted to tourists on Sunday - but you wouldn’t know it unless you had a guide to tell you! Definitely hire a guide to take you through the hanok village - it’s definitely worth the money and you will get some great pictures out of it! Our guide, Matt from This is Korea tours, took us through the village and showed us the best spot for pictures!"
Very nice,Good for educational and sightseeing and photo ops purposes. Gives you ancient koreanovela feels if you watch K-dramas.
Cool to see! ,"An ancient area dating back 600 years. It’s a residential area, and you can tell they aren’t that fond of being a tourist attraction, but accommodating to let tourists walk through. "
Go as early as possible!,"A ""Must Visit"" place. One of the nicest places to visit in Seoul and... it's free!!! It is very busy with tourists so go as early as possible in the morning if you want to enjoy it all by your selves! But as it is not an actual ""touristic place"" by choice and people still live their daily lives in their homes, please be respectful and quiet. It is always mentioned on other reviews as well but it was sad to see that a lot of tourists did not respect that. It goes without saying that having your camera or phone camera is essential! Lot's of great photo opportunities."
"Nice, not spectacular","Nice area with beautifully kept houses and some small restaurants. Nothing special, but I have a feeling I only walked trough a small part of the area. "
Residential village,"Good to see all the streets of Korean housing, people do live here so bear that in mind. The roads are VERY steep so not for those who struggle with that."
History Written all Oer the Walls,"How about seeing an old village in the busy heart of Seoul? Interesting, isnt? I was really happy to find a place like this because, even though Seoul is an economic power, Koreans still preserve a little piece of their heritage in a their very advance and modern metropolis."
Quaint place,The place is quaint and easy to navigate. It is a brilliant idea to preserve the village! Many shops and cafes around too. 
Great experience ,"I loved the village, got to see abit of history , long walk around the village, need a map to get around, but will definately go back again."
Seems like they don’t want tourists there,"This place was cool but there are lots of banners up saying tourists not welcome, as a protest from the residents. This made us feel a little uneasy! I preferred Gamcheon cultural village in Busan as it was more welcoming and had a stamp collection element which made it fun"
"Very interesting architecture, fantastic spot for photos","These are traditional Korean Houses back from around 600 years ago. There are many small alleyways, and long roads for great pictures. I came here after exploring Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Blue House, a walk away! Afterwards, I'd highly recommend visiting the renovated courthouse, a walk away again, haha. Also, there was a Hanok that was available to tour and explore, so that's a must!"
For fans of the traditional,I would plan at least a half day to spend in Bukchon - such a beautiful area and hard to believe you are still in Seoul when you are there - lots of uphill walking so bring your sneakers! Plenty of little boutique shops and cafes - perfect for a relaxing afternoon 
Love this place ,"Very nice village to visit, very traditional and very pretty and nice to walk around. Just that some areas were steep, elderly need to be careful. Very well preserved place, there are still people living there and hence pls be considerate and do not talk loudly and behave rowdy. Overall, I think it I worth a visit. "
Worth a visit,This is a lovely residential area which worth to pay a visit. The houses are beautiful but we didn’t have a chance to look inside!
A slice of Seoul,We enjoyed wandering the streets and also spent one night in a traditional guesthouse. This had futons on the floor and breakfast was served in a traditional style the next morning. Well worth the experience.
Old town in the middle of a modern city,This is a must-visit place. It's very well preserved and it's like your transported back in time. It's always packed with people but you can still manage to take pictures without including them in your photos. Place is good for kids too so you may take your family here.
K drama feels ,"Bukchon Hanok Village is a traditional residential, Most popular tourist spot in Seoul, most of them very well maintained, very nice place visit. do respect the residents there and enjoy the place in a quiet manner ☺️ "
Traditional Village in the city,"Bukchon Hanok Village is the small village in in middle of buzzling city of Seoul which keep its traditional architectural houses. If you'd like to explore the inside of houses, try not visit it in the evening because you can not go inside after 5 PM. Wearing hanbok while exploring the house will give you new experience of the real Korean village people."
Nice stroll,"We strolled through this village which is well-preserved from hundreds of years ago and still has inhabitants throughout. It was OK but once you get here, there is limited observation other than externals of buildings."
Not as good as I thought,"The view points of Bukchon Hanok Village was not as scenic as I expected. Perhaps I started in the wrong direction and it was a long day after my 4 hour visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace. I gave up looking for some of the view points. Anyway, I’d like to share with you the route map of Bukchon Hanok Village. I think if you start from Exit 2 of Anguk Station and head to “View Points” 3, 4, 5, 7, 6 and 8 first, then View Points 2 and 1 you may have an easier time to find the View Points and will be walking downhill. I started with View Points 1 and 2. From View Point 2 to 3 was a rather steep uphill climb. Anyway this is just a suggestion. View Point 1 - Panoramic view of Changdeokgung Palace was a disappointment. "
Beautiful but...,"The Bukchon Hanok Village is undoubtedly on a lot of tourists radar during their visits to Seoul - but a lot has changed! I stopped by here after visiting the nearby Palaces, especially as Lonely Planet recommended it as a ""must-see"" part of Seoul. However, due to the high volume of tourists, the residents inhabiting the village (it's one of the last areas you can see this traditional architecture) make it very clear that loud noise, pictures, etc. are not welcome or appreciated. I personally just walked through to appreciate the area, but couldn't stay very long as a result. If you want to go, it is a really special part of Seoul, but do keep the ""warnings"" in mind. "
SHHH- they dont want you here,Amazing picture worthy area but it is very picky neighbors do not like to have visitors in the area in fact there are lots of signs telling everyone they are to be quiet. 
Amazing!!,What a beautiful place but must be ready to walk. Also a must visit if you want to feel the history of Korea. Beautiful old buildings and you can envision the Josean Dynasty time. We travelled in the beginning of Summer but it was still memorable.
Bukchon Hanok Village,This is a good walk around the old Korean Village and you will see all the old houses and of course some have been converted to shops and eateries...
Traditional Korean houses,"Close to subway Anguk station (line 3). We spent 2 hours walking around ancient Korean houses . Very unique style of the buildings and amazing atmosphere. We traveled in the mid of August and the weather was super hot, but still enjoyed our trip to see this village "
Traditional sight seeing ,A good place for having a feel of what old Korea is like. Authentic food and beverage also served here along with souvenirs galore. All ages welcome 
Amazing,"Amazing how did the village still kept it’s old look and modernized at the same time ... I would really advice people to visit the village however, it would be very much appreciative to be quite as the people are negatively affected by tourist and kept silence is something really good, the architecture of the place is well maintained I loved the place ManalOman"
One of the last remaining traditional villages,"Bukchon Hanok Village is one of the last traditional villages in the ever-developing city of Seoul where you can still see cobblestone paths and traditional Korean houses. A great place to appreciate the architecture but sadly due to the high volume of tourist that visits this place, the residents are unwelcoming and there are signs telling people to keep quiet or not to take pictures outside their gates."
Leisure ,"Quite nice architecture but all doors are closed except for one or two which have been turned to shops. The street can be narrow and steep. I was surprised to see a banner that roughly says ‘No tourists please ‘ and no talking signs pasted on most doors. I guess people live inside these houses and the whole atmosphere is very quite except for those made by tourists. Despite the hot summer, some tourists are game enough to wear traditional dresses to take photos."
Be very quiet ,"Even tho locals don't like you visiting as they feel it's invading their privacy, it is a beautiful street with lovely traditional houses worth seeing. Just be mindful that people live there and dont make too much noise. "
Don’t be intrusive,Only good if you like taking pictures with traditional Korean houses. I felt it was too intrusive as there were noisy tourists everywhere even though the signs say “Please Be Quiet”. A quaint little area but pushed slightly beyond my comfort area.
Just too many guests.,"This is a popular scenic spot in Seoul. It is famous for the Korean traditional houses and streets. Many tourists are here experiencing the traditional Korean costumes. It is ironic that you can see a lot of angry banners reading “no more tourists, we are suffering from noise” from the local residents while tourists still take photos and chat loudly around."
Korean Village,"This is residential area. I admire the idea of ""showing"" Korean traditional houses (only several houses were open and allowed to be entered), but still caring for people who lives there. There were persons who standing with banner to remind all visitors to be quite and to keep the area clean. Around the village, we can find small tea house, cafe and shops."
Most of the shops are closed on Monday,It looks lovely enough but I would avoid coming here on Monday because most of the shops were closed and definitely not in late July. The heat was just unbearable and all I wanted to do was to stay indoor.
A good mix of old and new,"We walked around lot of places to see,local restaurants, shops.Museums, and art gallery.Even a place to experience the dark, led by blind folks."
Must see,My daughter lives in Seoul so she took me here. It is a very charming Korean village. Many local Koreans live here. It is beautiful and if you are in the right place you can get pics of the old with the new seoul behind it. We loved walking around here. 
Refurbished traditional houses,"There are lots of refurbished traditional Korean houses here. You can walk around to explore the area and it is very picturesque. Some of the houses are converted into shops, so you can go in for a visit and take some photos.Many little shops and cafe here, so you can stop and relax, when you are tired. "
Wander the streets of a picturesque neighbourhood of traditional Korean homes,"Perched high above the more modern streets below, Bukchon Hanok Village is best visited during the summertime at dusk, basking the low buildings and their details in a soft glow. Per other reviewer comments, some locals don't like the attention and have signs begging people to be respectful and quiet; a request I was happy to oblige. However, given the world's most populous nations have yet to travel to Seoul en mass, my best advice would be for those unhappy with the noise some tourists can bring to sell up now. Regardless, there are plenty of great photo opportunities for the curious traveller, as well as some shopping opportunities and cafes hidden throughout. A good access point is from Samcheon-Ro, which runs north-east from the eastern side of the Gyeongbokgung grounds. Follow the sidewalk maps and signs until you find a narrow, steep staircase disappearing between the cafes and houses (Google maps: 37.584644, 126.982128 .) Climbing the staircase you'll soon reach a street overlooking Samcheon-Ro below, with views back to Gyeongbokgung. Follow the signs carefully and you'll soon find yourself amid streets of stunningly restored and maintained homes. Follow the streets in an easterly direction before gradually following the twisting, turning narrow streets downhill in a southerly direction. A dusk visit will also avail you to some great dinner opportunities as you approach Yulgok-Ro."
Bukchon Hanok Village,"This is a a place with nice buildings and architecture, but as it is also a residential area, the residents were not happy with tourists visiting this place and had banners and signs put up saying they dont welcome tourists. There were also signs to say we have to speak softly. There were guides nearer to the main street, you can get a map from them to aid in your walking"
Not worth the time!,"Perhaps it was a hot summer day, we were dehydrated and hungry, the visit to Bukchon Hanok Village was not the best experience in Seoul. We walked and walked, and came upon some small alleys with traditional houses, that was it!!! It was interesting to see many visitors, dressed in traditional Hanbok, and taking poses in the 100 degree weather. The highly rated Ginseng Chicken Soup restaurant was a disappointment, too hot, lack of taste, and varieties. What menu choices? the restaurant only served one dish during our visit. "
Bask in the old heritage,"Backdated post: May 2017.Loved admiring the architecture of the hanok houses. Amazing wood work and the tiles were so pretty. Its VERY hot in May, recommended to go in spring or in autumn. Take a map from one of the guides and guide your way through.Along the road once you are out of the area you can find the famous O’Sulloc cafe where they sell all things green tea."
We were unwelcome guests ,"The village itself is wondetful, it has beautiful plants, lovely houses, and architecture. But this is a residential area, and the residents are not happy about the tourists disturbing their peaceful neighbourhood. There are some gentle signs on the houses by the government to keep quiet, but the residents have put up flags that say: Get out, you are not welcome! These really degraded my experience, but if you talk quietly, it's definitely a must see."
Quiet place,"Visited here as part of a private tour...just me, my daughter and the guide. It's a quiet change from the larger more commercialized tours. Worth it if you have a historian as a guide. There were some locals starting to gather to protest against the large tour groups due to the noise. But there are also a lot of local shops geared towards tourists. "
Rent hanbok and take pictures here!!!,"Hanbok rental can be a bit more pricey than at the Palace around 10,000krw for 1 hour, however, It’s better for pictures here and you wont have to do much photoshop to cut out strangers from your photo :D go there around 9am, no one and no tour is there yet! Btw, keep the noise at the lowest level please, I did feel really bad for those people who lived there since there were a lot of tourists around after 11am."
Must to go for cultural experience,"This place is one of the best place to take picture and having an image of living in the old Korean. The houses are so pretty but when I went there, there are a few house that's under construction (which is the government help the people to maintain their house). And this place is sooo crowded. If you want to have a very good picture with less people you should come early morning."
NICE PLACE TO VISIT,"You can walk for some hours and learn more about Korea, there are nice houses, doors, little stores and coffe"
"Interesting, free and near other attractions","What's not to like? It is interesting, free, sandwiched between other sites you are likely to visit and a good place for a nice stroll. It is much more pleasant and less crowded than the more frantic, packed Namdaenum market. "
Beautiful!,This village offers you a way to look into past history housing. People still live in the houses so you have to be quiet and be respectful when you are walking around. The doors in some of these homes are gorgeous! Bring an umbrella if you are coming during summer months.
Ancient Heritage,One of the tourist attractions that offer Korean culture. Many historic old buildings of Korean cultural heritage sometimes have art performances here.
Nothing Special,There’s not much here to see. It’s worth a 30 minute visit if you’re in the area. There is one street where you can take a picture. 
Old City,"Step back into time, the architecture in this village is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen. The streets are a little bit hilly so I don't recommend going here in the summer like I did, it was super hot."
Average,I don’t regret going but I will probably skip this/will not recommend visiting this area to anyone. Its actually a residential area and there is a very big sign to say that tourist are not allowed in the area. I just don’t feel welcomed at all in this area. Although I know there are very nice shops/cafes in the area I just don’t feel like wandering around the village. Do not have high expectation if you go! 
Koreas traditional houses,"Bukchon which means ""Northern Village"" is found north of two famous landmarks in Seoul, Cheonggyecheon stream and Jongno. The Palaces surround this village (Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung and Jongno Shrine). In this village, you would be able to admire hundreds of Koreas traditional houses, called Hanoks. Aside from this Hanoks operating as cultural centers guesthouses, restaurants and tea houses for tourists to get to immerse themselves in the Korean culture, a lot of this Hanoks are still residential homes so make sure not to loiter and be too loud while going around the village."
"Fun, but tourists beware...","It was fun to walk around this neighborhood, but I felt kind of guilty that people live there and have to post signs telling others to be quiet. They post it in English and what I guessed was Korean. Tourists from other parts of the world were so loud, but you can't post in every language of the world. Some fun shops crop up randomly between the homes. Beautiful homes, fun, historic feel. But tread lightly and quietly."
Taste of tradition ,You can walk around the streets and look at all the cute shops that the area has to offer. I found a place where you can drink some traditional Korean beverages. It is a little bit expensive but the drinks are great so I would just go for it and enjoy the experience.
You could probably skip this,"I don’t regret going, but it was a waste of time. There really isn’t much to see or do, and the people living in the village are very vocal as to how much they hate that you are there. In prominent display are signs specifically complaining about and admonishing tourists. Who cares though because it’s not really a cool place to go. "
Nice but already too well on a tourist path?,This is a hilly part of Seoul amidst two royal palaces. Clean and safe but seems that - according to many notes on houses - the residents do not feel very happy about the many and loud tourists.
Wonderfully kept quarters in the heart of Seoul!,"This is a really large area and we had the pleasure to have a private guide showing us around! The village itself was ""closed"" this day refering to ""tourist-hours"" and it felt calm and serene :). Take your time, it is quite a bit of up and down walking. As we were guided by a girl we met at a gym who lived in the area, we were shown the local library and some other places where people lived ""at the side"" of the tourist routes, wich was unpayable!.The vew over Seoul from the highest point is Amazing! "
traditional house,"what should I say, yes it's old and traditional houses but imagine that a hundred year old house with a Lamborghini inside. nice house but not a must to see in Korea"
Nice but not a must see,"I was expecting more but it was just nice. You should get a map from the tourist info guides (red t-shirts) before going in, the map has got recommended walks withing the village. From a Tourist Information Office near Anguk Station I also got a map of the area. Insadong Street and Changdeokgung Palace are close by, I even walked here from Gyeongbukgung Palace. So it's not a wasted journey if you do not find the village that interesting as there are other tourist places to visit within walking distance."
Not as interesting as I hoped,"I expected more, but wandering through the streets it wasn’t very impressive and definitely not a must see for me."
Beautiful and interesting,Having ancient houses in a modern city is an amazing combination. Love the view of modern seoul from an ancient village. Lot of Interesting thing to explore and take nice pictures.
Lovely village ,"Beautiful and good photo op. Nice quaint cafes and tea house along the roads. Go for this teahouse in the picture, offers some serenity & serves flavorful tea"
Tiring and unwelcome ,"The walking journey from Gyeongbokgung was very tiring and hilly. Lots of tourist didn't follow the advise to keep their voice low. Noticed several posting on the wall indicated the tenant not welcoming tourist to their village.However, I enjoy looking at many beautiful doors each houses have."
dwelling village disturbed by tourists,a village with amazing folk houses used by local Korean as dwellings; I agree that the residence were disturbed by tourists. I would suggest tourists visiting Namsangol Hanok Village instead.
some place crowded but some not,actually i don't stay in city of seoul quite long time & always went to countryside in my short tour in last autumn. but i take this bukchon hanok village. easy to reach here & area was quite big actually. some place was crowded but some quite. good for viewing historical korea house. spend a day here to walk around & take picture. enjoyable.
Seoul vacation,"Seoul is a cosmopolitan city where you can still see traditional buildings. You just need to be able to manage some streets with incline. Since the area is a residential one, tourists need to respect the privacy of the residents. It’s a good place to take pics of the facades of traditional houses. "
Great Historical place in Seoul,"First, you should get a map from the tourist info guides (wearing red t-shirts) and follow the recommended path. Don't rely on Google Maps as it will lead you to the wrong place.While visiting this area remember that this is a residential area. Enjoy the area quietly and respectful towards the residents."
Amazing Old Village,"I was amazed by this place, because it was preserved by the community/the people living on this village. It was a nice experienced roaming around with the Korean Traditional costume."
So Interesting,What a great place to visit. Spent one evening in a traditional guest home. What a unique experience. The whole area is really very different. A one of a kind place to see.
Nice historical buildings,"spent about 1 to 2 hours there.This is a residential area so do be quiet and not be a nuisance to the residents there (not all welcome the prying eyes of tourists into their personal homes)Beautiful architecture. Would recommend hiring some traditional dresses for more authentic pictures but we were too hot and sweaty to get into those.But besides just looking at the resident's houses, there isn't very much to do there. But still worth a visit.PS : There is a self-proclaimed Michelin star Ginseng Chicken soup there near the entrance. It's a fake! We tried it and were disappointed. And my husband checked the Michelin guide and it's not there!"
Excellent place to enjoy traditional Korean Architecture,"A very quite place, beautiful architecture, it is a place as a example for traditional Korean neighborhood , please respect the local and do not make noise.You can pay and access to the observatory,It is a must during any Seoul visit, also the you can walk around the neighborhood where you can find good shops, cafe, bars."
Project Arirang - Jun 2018,"We found this place thru Air bnb. Very traditional lodging from the Jeosun dynasty. Reminds me of the traditional ryokan of Japan. The property is situated on a hill slope and built like terraces. There was a cellar basement room, 2 bed rooms, sitting room end a kitchen and toilet. It was made mainly of wood.We slept on futon mattresses. Quite comfortable. The place was comfortable with air con in each bed room plus the basement. The home was in traditional renovations of main wood and wooden floor. The modern part was the bathroom toilet and kitchen. The feel and experience is really authentic and we are happy with the choice of having this accommodation in our first of 3 segments to soak in the korean culture and history. From this home we can walk to gyeonbakkung palace which is anotger historical sight within the city. There is also the subway station. Around the whole village, there are many little shops offering a wide range of shopping and food beverage options.The only downside i believe is walking back to the home after a full day outing! It's quite a climb but manageable on paved little roads. Take a look at some of the pictures posted. This place is really very popular with many tourist and even TV crews spotted outside our home. Some tourist even thought we lived there and asked if they could come in but we had to decline as it was not our but someone's private property. "
Old style housing,"Get yourself a map before you enter the place as the road is very confusing. Luckily, there are tourist information officers with red shirt where you can spot at some places. Ask them of the famous spots so you won't waste energy to roam aimlessly.Toilets are hard to come by in the area.There are cafes and shops around, as well as some houses that are open for public free of charge.Make sure to respect the residents and do not cause any disturbance and loud noises."
"Used to love it, not anymore....","Really liked Bukchon the first time I visited but not this time. It was very touristy both times so nothing new but it was the banners around the village through which locals expressed their anger at tourists and how they are suffering through tourism which put me off. While I understand how constant flows of noisy, disrespectful visitors can be oppressive, it's really something they need to work out with the tourism authorities to find a solution rather than hang out insulting messages. Also at the end of the day, it's no big deal. It's quirky and quaint but the hanok buildings can be seen in other areas outside of Seoul. So if you are going to be going off the beaten track in S Korea it's not really worth visiting Bukchon. Its location between the 2 most popular palaces in Seoul make it an inevitable stop though. So if you do visit, be prepared for an unfriendly reception and try not to piss the residents off more by talking and laughing loudly (as we saw some inconsiderate visitors do). "
historical district ,"This is authentic hanok village, beautiful houses, small restaurants and boutique shops. However this is a residential area and they don't like tourists."
Bukchon,"Interesting place with many shops, restaurants, cafes. Generally it is possible to see some street activities also. Other than all these, you can see nice traditional houses, also many art galleries.Prices in all those shops are above the average level in Seoul. Also, in my opinion, no need to join any guided tour for here, even it is free. Just good weather is required."
Interesting Old Houses,"Seoul must change a great deal from the old days, so it's kind of fun to walk among the old building from the bygone area, narrow streets have some interesting cafe and shops, Korean folks still live here, please speak low, try not to make any noise, not to disturb their daily normal life."
Buckchon Village,"If you want to have a glimpse at South Korea's traditional architectural style, visit Buckchon village, with its narrow streets and extremely beautiful houses (hanoks). A piece of advice: since the area is inhabited and since there are lots of tourists coming to this place, try to express your admiration quietly, not to disturb the residents."
Pretty view from the overview spots,"There are many shops, cafe, restaurants in this area and the pretty old houses!! People are actually living in the old style houses, so you should have a respect to residents when you are going around. There are some overview spots which you have to pay but the view is pretty!! The streets are up and down, so it will be better to wear comfortable shoes!!"
bukchon hanok village,"Went on a late afternoon on a cold day. Very hilly be prepared to walk. Enjoyed it though, will coming back."
Time warp !,"When in Seoul, you must visit this lovely village. Clean , neat , well laid out. The houses of era gone past. lovely botique shops. You may be lucky to spot women dressed in traditional wear strolling on the roads & lanes.An enchanting experience"
Rustic place,"The place is wonderful well kept and pristine, but please understand this is a residential areq where ypu are free to roam please keep quiet and dont litter in the area... the people living in the area are annoyed of the noise in the area."
Skip if you're tight on time,"Visited June 2018. This is a low priority attraction. The best part of this attraction is the del monte mango ice cream popsicle at the nearby convenience store at a street corner. I don't remember the name of the store. For 50 cents, it was the cheapest and best mango popsicle ice cream I've ever had. Real mango flavor. We looked for this ice cream popsicle every where we went in Seoul and bummed we couldn't find it anywhere else. Bukchon Son Mandu dumplings restaurant was really good too."
Lots to enjoy,"Pleasant stroll through the neighbourhood. Mobile tourist information (people in t shirts with maps and recommendations ) available along the streets. Certainly not undiscovered, but a charming neighbourhood to spend a couple of hours exploring. We shopped for gifts here. The cafes and bars are quirky and interesting. Cool glasses shop in a converted workshop. Fun boutiques with interesting fashion , though surprisingly a number of them had no changing facility to try on the clothes. There is more of this neighbourhood than I was expecting. Charming traditional buildings, some open to the public for free, with quick craft activities to experience. Lovely tiled roofs and cute passageways, some pedestrian access only streets. Lovely Saturday afternoon. Lots of visitors wandering around in (hired)traditional dress, looked like there were enjoying the experience."
Time travel,"Walking there was a fantastic experience, for ambience and architecture. Lots of people rent traditional hambok clothes and stroll free there (this gives up an interesting flavour to te scene). The owners of the houses are not happy with the huge ammount of tourists every day,. but have definitely to cope with that.."
Small Village,Very nice place to visit. Easy access via train. Be cooperative to the villager so that they will allow us to visit this very nice place. We rented hanbok to go around. 
Bit doubtful,The walk was a beautiful but left us bit in down as on many places one can find posters asking tourists to leave - it is a residential area that is crowded by people yelling and taking pictures
Quaint village in the city,A quaint village in the heart of the city. Must see place if you want to experience traditional Korean culture and architecture.
Nice walk through the hanok village ,"It was a nice leisurely walk we took but everywhere around the village are signs to reject tourists and signs to say keep quiet. There are residents residing in the hanoks and i think tourists are really a bother to them. So try to keep the noise level down and move along fast. Don’t take too long to snap your fotos or selfies as well. Oh this is where the drama Goblin was filmed, but I didn’t bother to go find the exact alley and wall. Was trying to move along and finish my tour asap so as not to bother the residents. If you have time and is travelling solo, then mayb you can slowly explore. "
must see place,If you like the historical place then you need to see here a folk village. it is very interesting to know how korean live back then.
Traditional & Quanit,Definitely worth stayin here at a traditional Hanok. It’s worth the experience. The hanok cultural centre is very informative and the manager there was quite enthusiastic 
A village in the heart of a modern city !,Small remnants of a village can be found here in the center of Seoul. Try to have a Seoul map with you because korean people are not able to speak even a little english but they are extremely kind and polite.
Site seeing,Its really a sight seeing placing. Beautiful architecture and friendly business owner. U gotta walk the slopes. 
Interesting,"Although it was nice to see the village and the houses, I personally didn't think it was a must see or do. If you have a limited amount of time in Seoul then you can skip this village. It's just a bunch of traditional houses that most locals still live in. If your really into taking pictures at a traditional village then go ahead but be aware that not everyone's house want people in-front of it. I only recommend if you have a lot of time or extremely interested in an old town. "
Typical old village,"Typical old village with ancient houses, not many activities to do here. The view is also not really impressive. Can skip if you don't have enough time"
Sadly the locals aren't that welcoming to tourist,"A decent view of old Korean houses, many which are still residences. I have a mixed feeling about this place - as much as I want to walk around and see more of these olden architectures and there are official tourism officers roaming around to help in directions, we saw banners than hinted that tourists aren't that welcomed. I can fully understand - if you are a resident, you wouldn't want to have tourists roaming in your neighborhood, taking pictures and making noises!"
Telenovela Experience with Hanbok,- cultural experience we even rented Hanbok to take photos from the Hanok Village - a place where historical places / houses are preserved 
Lovely area of Seoul,"Stayed just next to Bukchon Village which I can highly recommend as you will not have a ton of tourists there early morning so if you are an early riser and wants to get in some nice photos before the crowds come, you should stay here. Overall, the traditional area is pleasant, and scenic. plenty of small cafes and craft shops. Taking a stroll here is a must if in Seoul. "
Well preserved residential area ,The streets and buildings are well preserved and served as residences for the locals. A lot of photo opportunities. However the locals seem to dislike the throngs of tourists flocking to the area and have put up banners stating their displeasure with visitors. 
A nice way to spend an afternoon,Its a few streets where there are old houses. The houses are occupied and you can stand outside on the streets to see. The houses are all along the hill so you will need to climb up
Traditional houses and quaint cafes,"Do the walk to Bukchon, eat at the samgaetang ginseng chicken restaurant and sip coffee at a nice cafe"
Cute,"The houses More interesting to look at. However, there were signs asking tourists not to come in because it was disrupting their lifestyle there. And many signs asking people to be more quiet."
Not bad,Went early morning with a friend of mine and the place is already packed with tourists with millions of selfie sticks. There are a number of quieter streets to walk around and there are also houses that converted part of their living room to a cafe. I recommend spending sometime at the home style cafes to get a feel of the interior. There are also people with information walking around (they can speak different languages to accommodate the tourists) and it is a good idea to get a map off them so that you know where to go. The streets are very narrow and be sure to stay quiet for the residents. 
Great shopping area,Lots of cool shops ranging from inexpensive to high end.Full of cafes and restaurants as well as museums and art galleries
Smaller than I expected,"Before arriving at Bukchon Hanok Village, I thought it would be streets and streets of old traditional buildings. But for some reason, it was smaller than i expected. Maybe we also went during the summer and there were fewer tourists around. The structures are REAL houses of people inhabit and they have many signs that said ""to be quiet"". I guess they're not too fond of tourists visiting their homes. There are also plenty of hanbok renting stores outside so you can rent the costumes and have a photoshoot there. Overall, we spent about 30 minutes to an hour exploring the place. "
Good old hanook village,Went there from gyeongbokgung palace and the village was lovely but beware of steep hill. Lovely place to live but they suffered a lot of noise from tourist and now banning tourist from entering their village since they live there and lots of ppl means noise. 
Nice cultural village,It was an interesting walk to see the different types of traditional Korean houses. Would love to walk around more had it not for the hot sun that my friends could not take the heat.
Good experience,"Difficult to find, but worth the effort, very old, traditional buildings housing small, quirky independent stores and coffee shops, very close to Changdeokgung palace! "
Long walk and steeps upslope!,If you wish to come here please get hold of a map. The map detailed the required walking route and photo point. The weather and the slope is a killer and not suitable for elderly with walking issue. There are also volunteer tourist information ambassador going round. So if you need help just ask them!
Old Seoul experience great for picture-taking,"We were a little lost when we went there because we thought it was a specific place but it turns out it was a whole neighborhood. It is a residential area and has signs everywhere reminding tourists to be quiet. There are many hanbok rental shops around if you want a more authentic experience. We stayed there for only an hour or less since there aren't many things to do aside from taking pictures. My tip is to go there early and find a nice, hidden spot if you don't want pictures where there are a lot of people."
Deep dive in old Seoul ,Entering the village feels like stepping into past. This is really nice to see these traditional houses . It gives such a nice feeling and contrast compared to modern Seoul. Must go visit!!!
Tourists were not welcomed,"It was indeed a cool place to visit BUT as the title says, we were not very welcomed by local residences. Banners were all around to remind tourists to keep their volume down and also there were some expressing the residents’ anger towards the government for making their neighbourhood a tourist attraction.If you’re looking to visit here, just be respectful and keep your volume down. It’s a nice place to take some photos, there are some places where there are slopes so becareful."
Worth visiting but keep your voices down,"Though I felt bad about walking around in this area because of all the sign telling tourists to keep their voices down and not disrupt the neighbourhood, since this is a residential area first and foremost, but it was still a really worthwhile place to visit. It did feel a little closed off though because every house had high walls and gates or bars to keep tourists from trampling around."
Original traditional Hanok houses,"Visited during my Essential Seoul Tour. These are the original Hanok houses. Some are open for visitors, art galleries, you can take a peak inside (shoes off first)."
Ok but.. ,This place is so adviced by hides but I was actually a little disappointed by it. The place is residencial you walk around houses and go inside but it doesn't feel so traditional compared to other place in Korea. 
The korean heritage houses!!,"This unique place is really in the heart of Seoul, Korea. We really amazed the Korean's preservation of their ancient houses which still exist to date. This is one of the place you need to visit in Seoul."
Old originaliteit village,"Surely you must visit to get a good impression of the originaliteit houses of old Korea.IT can be crowdy, thats also the reason that the inhabitants are not happy with all this visitors.Korean people can hire orginal cloths to dressed up.It is a nice view"
Little streets of history,"Had a great wander through these streets dotted with cafes, art and boutique pieces of souvenirs. Lovely vibe and saw many people dressed in rented traditional gear strolling around here.It’s very accessible from the palace and would be a recommended stop for those interested in doing a walking tour around the area. Plenty for all ages."
Restored and lovely,"The hanok houses here have been restored, very lovingly, and have attracted many visitors. These days the people who actually live there are starting to resent the constant stream of tourists gawking at their homes - but it is still worth a visit. Stick to the museums and main street and you will see wonderful examples of Korean architecture."
Heritage well kept! ,"Such an interesting place with lovely views, many flowers, trees, old houses and some amazing activities for families and youngster. You should go in early morning to feel the peace and the stillness there! "
Out of the way but picture op aplenty ,We thought this place was near or in Insadong but we were so wrong. The nice folks at the tourist Info sorted us out so we legged it there and carried on legging it. It's a nice mix of old albeit refurbished and new. Lots of photo ops around so let the inner photo maniac rip!
"Fairly easy to find, interesting historic village.","We caught the Subway Line 3 to Anguk Station (Exit 2), walked straight about 250 meters to the village. Walking up the hill you will find many traditional houses that appear to have been kept in very good condition. Well worth the walk up to the top of the hill where you will see a nice view over park land and the city toward the Changdeokgung Palace. I'm pleased we made the effort while visiting Seoul."
Traditional suburb,It is a place where you can see how ancient homes looked like. It is interesting to occidental people to have a look on the differences of the construction styles.
Traditional place ,Traditional place with the beautifull view. It is like i live in korea. I love it. I recomended for you guys
I love IT,"If you are crazy about the pictures challenges go on this historic area!You ll do some beautiful pictures and in same time a good physical exercise !It s really crowded , you can feel that some historical houses are fed up with the tourism, too loud, rude some of them don’t respect the privacy of the people who live there and who take care of this city patrimoine and witness !So go , enjoy but respect the life !"
Lovely area to stroll around,"Would recommend to visit when you're in Seoul, the view from the hill is pretty nice, and seeing many traditional houses is really something, when i visit, there are many tourists taking pictures, a little bit crowded, it's a residential area, so it's better to not make any noise while there."
Village of Hanok,"Even though many houses are built new and people don't live in old styles, this is still amazing place to feel old times.- Fun fact is to see lots of foreign tourists trying Hanbok on.- Good to have a connected trip with Seochon, Gyeongbokgung, Insadong, Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Naksan Park, Jongro Street and some other places."
Traditional Wooden Hanok houses and village - must see,"At the Northern edge of the city lies the traditional village of Bukchon, A must see for visitors to imagine how life was like in Seoul before the high rise apartments took over the landscape. Making the effort to walk up the hill through the small streets is worth it with great photo opportunities of the old houses with Namsan tower in the back ground. Stop for a coffee, cake, street food or try one of the many Korean restaurants for a taste of the local cuisine. While the distances are not far there are plenty of stops along the way to keep occupied for a few hours. On weekends start early and plan for lunch there. Evenings are also good but can get busy. We went with 10 YO boys and it was fine."
Feel of so Korean traditional houses and charming place to visit...,"You can experience the real Korean narrow, inclined street and so cute traditional house... Such a great place to enjoy the view for photographers and feel the stunning view of sunset over the city... It's must place to visit and feel the taste of up town life... But privacy of Residences is destroyed by tourists and locals... suffer from littering and noises... :("
Just make you tired,Residence here are suffering with tourist. You better explore other place. Nothing special here just make you & your feet fatigue. Trust me. 
Charming traditional houses,"There are signs all over that this is a residential area and to please be quiet, refrain from,smoking, etc. Charming old style houses set within the city. There were a couple places which had, for a fee, traditional art workshops. A number of tourists chose to rent traditional outfits, hanboks, at nearby stores, to walk in costume thru the area."
Cute area but the residents don’t want you there,"I will admit the neighborhood is cute and the houses are beautiful. I’d like to say go there if you have time but the local residents are very opposed to the tourism and have hung a huge banner stating tourists are not allowed and are ruining their community. As we walked around I could understand their point. Despite the signs to be quiet and respectful, most tourists weren’t. There were crowds of people talking loudly, being obnoxious, kids were running screaming down the street with parents yelling after them. Worst of all, people were climb onto the doorsteps of the houses to pose for pics. I’d be mad too if strangers were literally at my front door everyday. "
"Nice, but visitors ruin it","This is a nice area with beautiful old traditional houses. But many visitors do no behave properly. Remember, this is a residential area. Be quiet and considerate and respectful. Come on your own and spend 1-2 hours. Don’t book a tour. These kind of things should not be exploited commercially. Big groups block the roads and the front gates of the houses. Just imagine how you would feel if hundreds of visitors would walk around in your street, taking photos of your house and blocking you? Be considerate, it’s easy and rewarding. If this was helpful in any way, we appreciate a like. Otherwise we’ll never know whether anyone reads this. "
Nice and quiet,Enjoyed walking in this neighborhood. Not as commercialized. Very nice visiting those old courtyards.
Average sight seeing location,"Actually not a very fantastic place to visit. Can go take a look if have the extra time and energy, but do not expect too much from this tour. As this is a residential estate, be careful not to be overly excited or speak too loudly, or you risk getting scolded by the locals. There are residents patrol to look out for tourists especially those behaving badly. When we were there, we saw signs put up by locals to remind tourists not to speak too loud, not to touch their properties, and some prevent you from taking photos in front of their house. "
Nice area with good atmosphere,"Bukchon village is a lovely area to walk around in this arts and crafts shops along with a nice atmosphere and pretty, old hanoks. Go to the information center for the area to get a map of the area showing where the good spots are."
Old and New,"Nice neighbourhood to walk around since the houses are mostly the traditional houses. Be prepared for an uphill climb if you were wanting to walk up the village. Fairly small and quaint streets with nicely decorated gates, some of which are shops while others are residential, although most of the souvenir and food shops are at the lower end of the village. There are signs around asking you to not talk too loudly. There was one house which looked like a museum. You could go in to see what one of these houses look like inside and it was free entry. Most of these houses have electronic gates and garage openers. The houses slowly become more modern as you walk away from the village."
History/Tradition,"People who wants to take photos are not allowed to make noise. It's great for photos and to walk around because its quiet. though there are too many people/tourist there, some are wearing traditional clothes that you can rent. Great experience for me as I'm into vintage stuff."
Beautiful traditional Korean houses,The street is narrow and you can see beautiful Hanok House side by side. There are some coffee places too. Do keep your voice low and do not disturb the quiet and peaceful environment there. I believed it is a good experience to stay in Hanok house.
"Nice neighborhood, but I feel bad for the residents","Very nice quaint neighborhood with lovely traditional houses, but there are signs at most of the doors saying 'keep out', 'don't touch', 'silence please', 'this is a residential area, muted talking' etc. I could not imagine living like this, I feel very sorry for the residents. This should maybe be a paid attraction with limited number of people, otherwise too much noise, but beautiful! Please keep your voices down when visiting!!"
Keep silent and make some photos,There are family inside the house so keep your big mouth. The government seems to keep this traditional house in the city. I believe the owner of the house is quite rich now because the have nice car and the automatic door complete with cctv around their house. Unfotunately there were some renovations around so I need to choose another corner. There was one open house that you can stop by. There was not any furniture inside but they sell some little gifts. 
Experiencing the traditional Korean,"An area where the traditional Korean houses still well maintained with lots of them housing residents and/or specialty art craft shops. As it is a resident area, the whole place is serene and peaceful, even though it is near to the main road. It was drizzling when my friend and I visited so made it even less crowded to stroll around."
Mainly for picture taking,"The houses are occupied, so the best you can do is just to have your picture taken in front of their doors. It seems there are workshops on some traditional stuff on the other side of the village, but for the residential area, it's just that -- lots of traditional houses. Make sure to stay quiet though so as not to disturb this residential area."
Great way to spend an afternoon,"I walked here after spending the morning at Gyeongbokgung Palace (amazing, by the way). The village is full of quiet, steep and winding roads with beautiful private homes, amazing views and interesting things to look at. Most of the buildings are historic representations of the architecture from many years ago. If you go on a weekend, you will be delighted to see many people dressed up in period clothing - I’m told this is a sort of Korean cosplay that has become very popular in recent years. "
Historic Jewel in Seoul,"Greatest views of the city. Great historic village. Wonderful cafes and art scene. Get a feel for how the elite lived hundreds of years ago. It is still an active residential district , so be mindful and respectful for people who live there. Visit the tourist center at the base of the hill for a local map and what not to miss. Great tourist tips from friendly staff."
Traditional Korean,Instagram for more food and travel @oppakulinerI love this place because you can see how the architecture of korean traditional house through this village. It's like I'm living on the same era that i watched at Korean drama and it's exciting for me
Busy place,"I was visiting Seoul as part of Olympic Games journey and fortunately a lot of people were off to the other coast to watch the Games. Still, there were people walking around, so if you are planning to see the village (where people reside btw, so quiet please) it is better to do it relatively early in the day. Otherwise, it's like Venice or Paris - you only get heads of hundreds of tourists on your pictures and do not see the soul of the place. "
Traditional Korea,Bukchon Hanok Village is home to traditional wooden houses called Hanok that dates back to the Joseon dynasty. 
What a wonderful place,You can smell the history of South Korea in here. People still live in this village and you have to be quite when you walk around the streets.
Little Korean Village,You can see the old Korean houses here. A must go if you travel to Seoul for the first time. It's a beautiful place to take photos. 
"Traditional residential street, no shops or restaurants ","This area is a residential living area, so it is great for photos. Don't expect to find food or shops here. If are looking for that there are a few streets outside of this area for crafts, art, and food. "
Keeping traditional arts and crafts alive,"This arts and crafts area is about 15 minutes walk from Gyeongbokgung Palace. We walked through narrow streets and into grand old buildings that had housed traditional craftspeople for hundreds of years. The buildings were pretty nice, so we presumed the area must have been pretty wealthy. There were people that dyed fabric, people that gilded gold leaf items, people making traditional Korean knotted items among others. We were allowed to enter the buildings to look around and if we wanted to take a class there was a fee. It was interesting for a quick look around but not really our thing."
Nice place ,"Nice place, easy walk from the palaces, full of good cafes and restaurants. We had a very good time here "
Absolutely beautiful! 100% recommend it!,We went up to Bukchon Hanok Village and was really worth it.After visiting the main palace next door just take a stroll down to this typical Korean village were people like to dress up with the tradition Hanok and you can take amazing pictures.Lots of restaurants and shops will recommend to spare 2-3 hours to visit.
Walking Uphill Could be a Challenge,"Jst eats of the major palace complex, they have info guides on hand and maps to direct you to the major sights. Be prepared for uphill climbs. Also fairly steep downhill stairs to get back down (if you do not retrace your route up)."
More cafes popping up,"Having been to Bukchon village at least 3 times in the past 2 years, my recent trip showed more newly opened cafes and pop up stores. Overall it is still a nice estate to wander in Spring, watching people dressed in Hanboks, sitting in old tea houses, visiting the remodeled traditional houses. For 1st time visitors, you can get a map from the tourist info booth. Coming here by subway is easy too, Anguk station"
Nice introduction to Hanoks,"A nice little cosy place for introduction to Hanoks, Korean traditional houses, in Seoul. One will find several signs of ""Silence Please"" as people still live here. Our guide told us that there are mostly used as vacation homes. It might seem intrusion into their privacy with loads of tourists invading the narrow street. Only a very few houses are open for visitors. We couldn't cover the entire stretch as we were tired coming here after visiting Gyeondbokgung palace, but I would believe its worth a stroll."
"Not bad, but maybe a bit overrated","You can see some nice traditional streets and houses (hanoks), but it can be a pain to find them. The so-called ""observatory"" is just a small top-floor apartment where you are asked to pay to enter - however the old lady is kind and gives you ""free"" tea, coffee or juice. You can only enjoy the view through windows.If you have a day for it, visit Jeonju for a real hanok village!"
Best Hanok village!,This is the best Hanok village in Seoul where one can get to see the architect and the beauty of the buildings. Walking around and taking photos here is good.One can also rent the Hanbok and experience being a Korean back to the olden days walking around the village in it! 
Cultural and Relaxing,There is a nice route for tourist to walk around.Not many of the traditional home open to public.Took us less than one hour to finish the route including photo taking.You do jot need to join a tour if you just want to stroll around.The rental of the traditional costume is just at the beginning of the village.
Interesting but 'weird',"Hard to decide whether this is a touristy area that would rather not be or a homely village that gets invadedThe old houses are lovely to see in the narrow streets but our is people's homes and there are signs everywhere asking for peace and quiet, no peeping etc, so it felt a little uncomfortable at times knowing who behind the closed doors wanted us there and who didn'tThere are some that are 'open' to tourists, typically as a retail outletBut there is also an enormous number that are freshly refurbished "
Over-rated; Touristy,"It was a hike which we didn't mind. We followed a walking tour but yet we still didn't learn much. Houses were well, houses. Don't get me wrong. I totally adore beautiful architecture. The houses were nice but they are all rebuilt with new materials so it looks astonishing new. Comparing with Kyoto and the alleys of Shanghai, this place pales in comparison and it's extremely touristy with tourist traps all along the way. It's a nice walk but if you don't have time, give this a miss. "
Traditional Houses,"The Bukchon Hanok Village can be accessed via Anguk Subway Station Exit 2. This village is famous for its Bukchon's Eight Views for photography. We dropped here to have a look of the traditional houses in this village before heading to Gyeongbokgung Palace. The design of the traditional houses was beautiful. Since this village still occupied by the locals, hence the visitors must be ensure quietness is to be observed. We were here early in the morning, hence we could take various pictures without others appearing in our pictures. There is a shop for Hanbok rental located near the entrance of this village."
Nice houses. But way too many people. ,"Nice houses. But way too many tourists. Need a fair bit of walking to get here. Other than taking OOTDs, There's a tokudu museum in 1 of the houses. Very interesting information about the past death rites of the Korean. Admission is free, takes less than 1/2 hr to see. Worth it to go in to take a look. "
Traditional living area of olden days Korean,The place has undergone quite a change as was told by my local guide. As the local find it worthwhile to do preservation of their property even without the support of their government. Thus I do see some construction going on within the neighborhood.
simple neighborhood,"I thought I was going to see a lot from this area but was wrong. It’s basically a small residential area with traditional homes from many years ago. You can appreciate the design/structure of the homes made of wood. There were a lot of tourists walking around, there were signs all over the place to be quiet since it is a residential area to this date. The streets are really narrow and long. I rented out the hanbok dress at the store closest to the entrance of this village. It was pricier than others, but this was my last chance to dress up :).When we walked down out side the village, we came across the chicken ginseng soup resto, it was delicious!"
Good place to take pictures ,"Fun to wander around and take pictures. The tea houses are really expensive over there, but the village itself is fun to see. There’s some uphill walking but it’s not too bad. "
A slice of history,"This is a very lovely area of the city, which is a nice walk from the palace. Here you can see an active neighborhood that has preserved it’s old housing. There is a steep incline, or stairway, to get to the heart of the Hanok village, but it isn’t too long and worth it. "
Great Old/Modern Village,"You are not visit Seoul if you was not visiting Bukchon Hanok Village. An old village that kept to be its traditional style in the middle of modern city, makes a very great combination and art as well background of Seoul now and then. There are a lot of stores, boutiques, cafes, restaurants that can spoiled your shopping desire to the maximum.Eat lunch or dinner on this area and get the feeling of being local and blend with the environment.If you like, try to wear old traditional costume of South Korea and just walk around on this village. It make you looks like very South Korean people :)"
A jewel in the middle of modern Seoul.,"an interesting passage of traditional neighborhood in the middle of modern Seoul.These residential still maintain traditional architecture.Some of units has changed as coffee shop, etc.Unfortunately, there were groups of tourist when I went there, so it was quite noisy."
 just a neighborhood,Nothing wow or cool about it. The village is only a neighborhood whose houses are traditional. Kind of a waste of time for me. 
A bit underwhelming,"I had high expectations before the visit but left a bit underwhelmed. There is a suggested trail with 14 stops starting from Bukchon Traditional Cultural Centre. It can be reached from Anguk metro station by foot via Exit No. 3 in less than 350m.I was lost when I arrived so I only started from Point no. 6. There are shops that rent traditional Korean garb, and you’ll likely see many visitors (mostly ladies) wearing them. Photo opportunities along the picturesque paths will depend on the number of tourists. But chances are, it’s going to be a challenge to get a clean shot without others in the background. It was not that crowded with tourists when I visited, but enough to make the place feel cramped.Follow the tourist signs as some of the paths are dead ends leading to residential homes.Be prepared to walk upslope along some of the paths (something most able-bodied visitors should have no problem with, as this is a residential area).At the end of the suggested trail, you can continue walking to Samcheong, where there are eateries, coffee places and souvenir shops.There are also other tourist spots within walking distance, including Insa-dong, Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changdeokgung Palace, etc. Overall, be prepared to spend at least 1-2 hours wandering around."
Beautiful area in central Seoul,We enjoyed 2-3 hours wondering around the streets in this area. We started with a map but then just wondered down whichever road looked the prettiest! It does get busy but it is worth seeking out the quiet streets to enjoy the architecture without masses of people.
Our favorite part ,"Our favorite part of our trip , people wore in traditional dress. Made you feel like you were part of the old world . Found a near by small street with a few traditional restaurants (highlight) lots of boutique shops . We ended up visiting 2 times during our 5 day trip . "
Amazing,"Amazing! Old traditional residential area.Greta traditional architecture, also has nice views of the city. I recommend 1 hour to 1.5 hours"
Excellent Place - Experience the inside of a Hanok House,"I loved the walk in the Bukchon Hanok Village. It is such a peaceful and quaint and picturesque place. The place is residential and hence it is advisable to maintain silence. You can get amazing views of from the observation point. Make sure to collect the map at the information center. There are a few museums, Perfume gallery and tea houses and cafes along the way. Make sure you try the Korean tea at one of the cafes. The place where we went was a very cute little cafe / guesthouse and the hosts were so warm. The place was very old fashioned and antique looking. The hosts were very warm and friendly. They welcomed us warmly and the menu has variety to choose from. We went in for the traditional raddish tea and the berry tea called omija. The prices are pretty decent for the ambience and the experienc. It costed us less than 10000 KWr in total. The hosts are more than happy to take pictures for you and also suggest you good photo spots. The cafe name was in Korean language. I have attached the card for your reference. It was HoeHwaNaMu GuestHouse. It is a traditional Hanok House."
Good traditional place ,This is a wonderful place which I haven’t seen in before. The old building and lots of tourists really let this place cheerful. I like it. 
Well,"It is pretty nice but touristic. To me, it doesn't has an original character. It's just for tourists who walk around and take pictures. If you have time, you should go there. If not, you won't miss anything. Seoul has a lot of beautiful places... "
Nothing much to see..,"Just a neighborhood with some Hanok styled houses where some people actually live there. It is quite interesting to see such kind of place to live..but that’s it. So, if you’re going to Gyeongbukgong, don’t waste your time and energy to come here, since there isn’t much to do or even see."
Quaint town,A lot of steps up but view was amazing. What was nice was the area surrounding it with small cafes and shops. 
True Korea,"If you want to see and feel real Korea, go to Bukchon village. It’s within a walking distance from the main palace. Wander the narrow streets, pass by traditional houses...find a hidden observation spot in one of them. "
Big Traditional Village,The Village is quite big for Traditional Korean Village. People are still live in the Village so that make it unique.
experience of traditional Korean uptown,This is traditional uptown of Korea located close to Kyungbok palce. Powerful families used to stay in this area in old days and some of the architechs are well maintained still now. You can have rental hanbok and enjoy traditional tea enjoying the atmosphere.
Traditional Village In The Middle Of Modern City,"Bukchon Hanok Village will bring you to the latest year of Seoul, the village here was so cozy and clean. many shop provided for tourist to learn the traditional way."
Nothing special,"Thank to good weather it was pleasure to take a walk there, but village itself just bunch of old time building and you cannot get in there"
Want to go again!,"A really beautiful place in Seoul to enjoy traditional architecture. There are many cafes and restaurants as well as souvenier shops, so it's a good tourist spot. +you can rent a hanbok to walk around and take cute photos! Recommend!"
A little piece of history in the city,"Very easy to access, small area that can be finished in 30 mins. A look back at how houses were before. You can also rent traditional Hanboks along the way."
Small Village,"If you are curious how the residential area of the Koreans look like, you can drop by here. Maybe take a few photos, maybe an hour will do. This has become a tourist spot so you see signs of the residents to ""keep quiet"" to respect their privacy. Small village, nothing much to see and do. "
OLD SCHOOL Korea...,A must visit! So much fun walking all around town and seeing the true Korean culture! Good Times....
Quiet clean Village,I like this place.Its so quiet and the villages we visited was very clean.They even let us use the comfort room.Nice walkway and a lot of shops within the area.
Be patient for photo opp!,"This whole stretch of traditional houses nestles in between of busy roads. It can get very crowded though and very hard to get photo opportunities.When we went in december, one section was closed for filming (maybe it’s some korean drama) and the annoying part was there were cars passing by the narrow street. If you’re going to the palaces nearby, may as well visit here as it’s within walking distance (quite a long walk though).Not recommended for eldery or family with young children as the walk can be pretty tiring."
A must Visit place,I really enjoyed this historic village as there are a lot shops that offer numerous choices for me to rent a hanbok and also they offered items with a good price. There are certain place and area that is very picturesque as a good choice for a tourist to take a good photo in this place.
a nice walk,it is a very nice walk very close to the centerhouses are very well preserved and the overall area is very nice to walk trough 
"A space in the city, you don't expect.",Quietness all around. Cozy tea or coffee shops. Arts boutiques. Private houses well maintained. Ancient and elegant ambience. Not to miss. 
Good experience,Good to know and see the korean traditional house. Nice place to walk and take photos. Can take a break at the locals opening restaurant there.
Heritage Houses in the city,"Got to see how Korean maintain their heritage house. Tourist guide can be found easily in the street and can able speak English, Chinese and Japanese. Some tourist rent Hanbok and take pictures with houses."
Great visit to the traditional Seoul.,"If you enjoy architecture and culture, this is a good place to visit for 2 hours. On the way, they have great rice cake stand made out of real rice. It is a rural area where people live, so do expect some walking and do not expect a lot of shopping, although they do have some stores opened.Located nearby the Blue House (Korea's White House) and other government buildings."
Well kept,Good experience to see the 'older' side of the residential area. Most of the houses are well kept and clean. Many tourists rented the hanbok to take pictures.
Heritage place for great photography..,"We rent our hanbok at 公主韓服 (韓服租借)Princess Hanbok at 52-6 Anguk-dong, Jongno-gu, is 2 hours at 10000 won and 4 hours at 15000won for normal hanbok, if you choose different type of hanbok the price will be different (do take note) you can always ask the shop assistant, they speak very well chinese. By wearing Hanbok you can visit the Gyeongbokgung Palace for free. Places around this village is nice for a heritage photography, Goblin fans do take note, there is one scene from the drama itself is located here too. "
Heritage houses,A few houses along a steep slope with some shops selling souvenirs and ice-creams nearby. not worth the visit. Waste time
Very interesting,It was facinating to visit a traditional village that has been so well preserved. There are many interesting exhibits as well as live performances of Koreans in traditional costumes.
Not what I expected,After spending most of the day at the palaces my husband and I took a short walk to Bukchon. The area is totally not what I expected - there isn't really anything to see or do! There are a couple of restaurants/cafes and an okay view from the top of the hill but it was lacking the historic charm and vibrancy that I expected. There are a few galleries around but nothing worth writing home about.I would check out Bukchon if you are in the area but wouldn't suggest going out of your way to come here.
Hanok - traditional Korean house,So cool to see all those old houses. It is possible to peep into some of them and see what's inside. Also many old coffee shops
very intresting,Spent sometime walking through the village and and is interesting to see the wooden houses. It's pretty close to a metro station is one the things to do in Seoul. 
Picturesque Modern Old village,"If you are a lover of old architecture, you would love this place. It is also a nice place to capture lots of photos if you are wearing a Hanbuk bt overall it is just stroll to see the old village that has been modernize. We spent 1-2hours here while crossing from Gyeongbukgung to Changdeokgung. "
Amazing view,The view is fantastic! You get to see a lot of traditional houses and there are a few good traditional restaurant next to the Hanok Village
Good exercise! ,Place was easy to find with Naver Maps app. It’s basically an uphill walk and a quiet residential area. Good for exercise those legs with steep hills. Many areas for Instagram worthy photos. 
Walk Down Memory Lane,"This place was part of my check list before arriving in Korea, however due to time constraint and prioritization of sites this was initially deleted. I prioritize museums, after visiting the National Palace Museum, on our way to National Folk Museum we found ourselves walking on the lovely streets of this beautiful village. Rows of well preserved traditional houses, coffee shops, souvenir stores as well as stores offering hanbok rental can be found in the village. The walls that surround the village makes the place more beautiful. It was really like walking down memory lane. I wish I have longer time left to explore the village and to walk in every alley. I only spent 30 minutes here but I was in awed with its charm and beauty. I will surely visit this village again once I return to Seoul."
Beautiful village!,"Happy to be able to visit this village. It was a great experience to walk thru the village and see how the older homes used too look like! It's such a beautiful place that, it is still home to families, so respectfully, do your best not to make any loud noises or try to open any doors, they also have signs on their homes that say the same thing."
interesting and worth the visit,"traditional Korean village where you are able to learn more about some of korea's history.many places of interests, gift shops and restaurants nearby.walking distance from subway so it's pretty convenient.quite a fair amount of walking required if you want to see more sights.tourists or locals can rent their traditional outfits for photo-taking.not sure on the rental prices or the duration cause my wife didn't want to wear them.but you can see many people wearing them along the streets."
Rows of traditional Korean houses ,"We walk here from Gyeongbokgung palace using naver map and also the free map of bukchon provided by the red clothes tourist information were helpful . Some of the houses here have converted to tea house , b&b, etc . It was a steep walk and needs good stamina walking up the hill . "
traditoonal korean village,first it is quite a distance to walk from subway..please board a village bus if you have difficulty walking.secondly it has a slope so high that one must rest on and off..very nice views of the old traditional korean villages.please note museum was closed on sunday when i visited..wasted trip.many tourist ambassadors wearing red helping tourists on how to reach destination.but i have problem looking for the observatory.gave up eventually..should try the other namsangol hanok village which is easier to locate.
Old seoul preserved,Feels stepping into 700 years ago in the heart of modern Seoul. Small houses preserved and all renovated and converted to small shops and restaurants and B&B. Nice walk and exploring time.
Bukchon Village,I feel sorry for the people that live in this neighborhood. There are signs that ask visitors to be respectful and speak quietly. But the chance to see Korean architecture is not to be missed. They have beautiful homes and views with some shops that will allow you to go inside and see what the home is like on the inside. 
Leisurely peaceful stroll through a picturesque traditional village,The Bukchon Hanok village is up on a hilltop not far from the hustle and bustle of the center of Myeongdong and the Palace. It 's a fairly steep climb up through the narrow but picturesque little streets. Inside some of the homes are workshops selling or teaching Korean craftsmanship. There is a nice view of the rooftops from the top of the village. The doors on some of the homes are quite ornate and fun to look at. Walk down the hill and stroll through the nearby shops and cafes. Nice place to spend about 3 hours.
Bukchon Village Seoul,"Quaint village like area in the heart of Seoul, this is a real residential area and not made up for tourists, lots of little side streets and some are quite steep to walk up. From Anguk station take exit 2 and follow the signs, there are also tourist information people around to ask as well."
Rferreras,Must experience. Rent their traditional costumes then tour the village! Great for unlimited pics and memories.
Dark Too Soon,"It was kind of disappointed when we finally arrived the village; but it was too late and too dark. We could not see too much. We started the day touring the old Sejong Village and the Tongin Traditional Market on the other side of the palace, had late lunch then, walk around top of the Palace to the other side. We tried several pathways shortcuts into the Bukchon Hanok Village area; but not successful. Finally we had to walk down further and cut back in. The better way to the village is from the south end, subway station near the Japanese Embassy."
Colorful art,"Beautiful place to spend a afternoon, looking some designs, art, color and great coffee shops. U can wear a traditional clothes there and walk around."
Thoroughly enjoyed explore Bukchon Hanok Village area,"I loved wandering the narrow alleyways of the village. It was great to see the traditional housing. On the down side their were lots of tourist doing exactly what we were, but we found by ditching the map and just wandering, rather than following the crowd, it worked better. It's an area of new and old houses, all in keeping with the traditional style.Important to be respectful as these are peoples homes and there was a lot of publicity about noise levels etc.There are some great cafes in the area, so we had a good mix of exploring versus coffee, food and wine!We ended up going down some steps and ending up in a really hip cafe/bar area which was a good find as well."
Very interesting place to visit. Worth the trip ,Went to the Bukchon Hanok Village and it was a trip worth making. The traditional house is really nice. 
Beautiful traditional old village,"It's a nice place to visit, you can even rent their traditional Hanbok costume for taking pictures around the Hanok Village, costume rental costs 10,000won per hour, hairdo + 5,000won"
"Interesting look at the traditional houses, but crowded","While we visited the Gyeongbokgung Palace, we realized it was only a short walk to the Bukchon Hanok Village so we thought it would be a good opportunity to look at the traditional houses. First off, even in the middle of winter it was very crowded. Since the area is essentially just a neighborhood of new and old houses which keep the look and style of old Korean dwellings, to walk around is free. This attracts a lot of people as expected. What I personally found is that you don’t truly see much while you are there. Because you walk in and around streets and alleys you only really see roofs, walls and doors. Don’t get me wrong it was interesting but not what I expected. It is also more visually stunning than what pictures will ever be able to capture, so in my opinion take a few photos but don’t be worried about photographing a ton of structures. You can go in a few places that are now shops, but we decided to forego that process since they were mostly tea houses and I’m not a big tea drinker. Also the touristy shops on the main street are nothing to get excited about. The one thing we did do is find some great food in the neighborhood. We ended up at a great noodle and dumping house where we partook in both delicacies. It was amazing and for only 15,000 won (or a little less than $15 US) we were both stuffed. "
Not much to see,It is an area to visit once and only takes about 10 mins since not too much to see. The Ginseng Chicken Soup Restaurant is definitely a pass. Not worth dining there. 
A taste of days-gone-by Korea,"Take a walk through this ‘village’ to get a taste of what Korea was like before Seoul became a megalopolis. More like several, wide city blocks Bukchon village is a nice mix of narrow streets, tea and coffee houses, museums, craft workshops and little shops interspersed with private homes from modest to quite grand. Stop at the visitor center for a map with a nice walking trail laid out and then be prepared to wander for the next hour or so as you explore. Tip: stop at the tea museum (top of the trail) for a great view of the village and surrounding area. It costs 5,000 won to get in but includes a nice cup of tea with your view. "
Charming historical environment,Charming small streets in old town of Seoul. Easy to walk. Nice craft shops and cafe's. Close to CBD. 
A stroll through a different time,"It is like time stood still in some areas, a look into traditional Korean housing. Many Koreans walking around with traditional outfits make it even more authentic. Remember to keep your voice down as people live there, but provides great views and takes you around eventually to some nice shops. "
Mix of old and new,"I took a free Seoul walking tour of this area, which was great for getting the historical view. Even without that, one can get a great look at historically-preserved homes that keep a bit of old Korea around in the heart of the growing city. The homes are typically private residences and very well maintained. It’s fantastic for photos to really capture the blend of old and new."
Good on a sunny day,"It was nice to see the place and the street but I was expecting more traditional houses and the life styles of people. But this place become more touristic and less traditional , but it's good to see it"
Amazing,This place is incredible beautiful. Even tho it was super cold we had a great time. Korea is not just kpop. A must go! 
Traditional houses dated back to Joseon Dynasty,"The traditional houses at Bukchon Hanok Village is extremely beautiful. There are cultural centers, guesthouses & tea houses at the village providing visitors with an opportunity to experience Korean cultural. "
Another place to take pictures,"From the Gyeongbokgung palace, you can just walk about 1-2 km to this village. Please get a map from the information counter. If not, you will lost. You cannot make too much noise because this is a residential area. I don't recommend you to buy souvenirs from this village, it is a bit overpriced."
Great for Photos,"Great for photos but other than that, not much to do as it's a residential area with a few converted to galleries or shops."
Nice traditional korean town,"It was something nice to see. There’s not a whole lot to do here except to see the old traditional houses. It’s possible to do a “korean experience” here, but was too cold when we went so didn’t stay too long. "
Amaizng stroll,"Great place to see some architecture, take some pictures and meander at your leisure. Easy to get to from metro. Multiple places to stop for some shopping, eat or drink. Highly suggest if the weather is nice strolling from the palace over to just enjoy the area."
Beutiful doors,"This Village have really beutiful hanoks, tradicional Korean houses. Some times you can see the TV stations shooting o show in this location. If ypu like wood work you can see that some of this houses has a really pretty doors. Is really well take care and really clean too."
"Very touristy, but worth a quick wander","Worth a quick wander to see the old houses, and enjoy views of old-and-new side-by-side. Rather full of touristy shops though. "
Unique!,"This is a very unique place to visit, but a little strange to be wandering in a neighbourhood and snapping pictures of actual peoples homes. Some are not too welcoming, but that is understanding. Be mindful and quiet as this is an actual community... Don't be the guys we saw, LOUD and posing for multiple pictures, etc. Great views when you reach the top too! One tip? There is a paid observatory, avoid it. Instead, walk around the corner and see the beautiful sunset for FREE! "
"A little ""Lost"" village","A little lost would've been an understatement as my sister and I followed the original Google maps & Naver direction but ended up quite far from where we were meant to be. Whilst lost, we also caught up with another 4 tourists who had the same directions as we did and were completely mistified on how we could've missed a whole village. After 25 minutes, we caught up with a local who advised us to walk down the complete opposite way for another 8 - 10 minutes and we found it as per our map screen shot below.All in good time and only good things come to those who are patient Right? Sure enough we found it along with a Michelin star ginseng chicken soup restaurant. #win."
Lovely little town in the city,This is a lovely little place to just get lost in. There are many small museums/galleries and interesting shops and of course the old Korean architecture. We found a nice little tea house in one of the old buildings and had a wonderful cup of traditional Korean Omija tea.
Traditional area,I may qualify this area as traditional...if you are a big fun of culture palaces then you should definitely visited. They are many hanok the traditional korean houses....you can take pictures inside the house also there's a palace nearby...you can also rent the Hanbok before going there from Hanbok shops nearby ... it's a very quite neighberhood where you can find nice restaurant we have tried an italian one which is very good....also don't miss a shop of traditional croissant...they're so much delicious they taste like a little drops of heaven
Nice korean homes,You can see alot of traditional house of korea in bukchon hanok village. The vibe is good. Remember to keep voices down as there are people living there. Wearing a hanbok to stroll around seems like a good activity.
Worth seeing.,"Not a large area such as Jeonju, but an authentic living space. Easy to get to from the central Insadong area."
Good place to visit for foreign travelers as well as for koreans,"This is a small village of traditional korean houses (Han-ok). This area was the place where government officers lived during Chosun dynasity, because of its location close to the Kyungbok palace. With an one hour, self-guided walking tour around the village, you can enjoy a scenery of korean traditional houses on narrow alleys. There are several shops where you can rent korean traditional outfits for your memorable picture. There are many attractive cafe, restaurants in Sam Cheong dong, a village near Bukchon. In addition, this place is close to other tourist attractions such as Insa dong and Kyoungbok palace. You can visit here after of before visiting these nearby places."
One of best spot in city fringe !,"Traditional houses, designer shops, houses architecture and nice cafe! Suggestion: Walk around with your hanbok "
Historical Place,Really a good place to go. It is a real houses so you shouldnt make noises there because the neighborhood..Come here and rent hanbok.. You will feel like in historical drama
Bukchon traditional culture center 北村文化中心,It’s a nice place for photo shooting if you have limited time to visit Bukchon. 如果你沒有時間，只能輕度遊北村，這裡很適合拍照。
Great place to see traditional houses,A great place to walk around and look at traditional houses for a couple of hours. Make sure you get a map which takes you on a guided walk all around the village. We got ours in one of the museums. Lots of little shops and cafes around.
Back to the old time,A nice walk with good food and souvenir shopping. The houses are very pretty and bring back the old time
Traditional Homes,Bukchon-ro 12-gil: A Row of Old Korean HousesThe architecture is unique. Glazed roof tiles to protect the house from the bitter winter of Korea and the torrential rains that regularly visits the country during its rainy months. The wooden walls of the main house is to keep the temperature inside as constant as possible.Just by walking down the road where these row houses were built makes one wonder and appreciate at the same time the conceptual design and construction of Korean houses. It is a traditional Korean village with lots of alleys and narrow streets. It was the residential quarters of traditional Korean people and was preserved to show the world a 600 year old urban environment. Tourists as well as amateur and professional photo enthusiasts crisscrossed the street taking as much pictures for posterity and what have you. Visitors experienced the atmosphere of Joseon Dynasty. These houses are simply a sight to behold. Bukchon means “north village.”
Authentic designs,Very beautiful and authentic place to visit to see the old traditional houses of the locals. Beautiful designs and very photogenic place especially with some snow on the roof of these houses. Place to visit. 10 mins walk to subway station and palace so can kill 2 birds with a stone.
a Village that represent Korean history,"i love the architecture of this village, lovely place to take a picture... i love walking and sightseeing here"
Nice sight of a mostly lost beauty,"If you imagine, pre war Seoul was filled with these traditional Korean houses you will find in this area. All lost for a more concrete solution, but here. On weekends people rent the traditional Korean clothing (Hanbok) and roam the streets which adds to attractiveness of this area, nearly nestled between the two major palaces of Seoul. There are many nice cafes and tea houses where you can relax from the busy streets and enjoy the inside of a Hanok.Do not forget to bring your camera and enjoy this glimpse into the past."
Back in Time at the Bukchon Hanok Village,"It's very nice to see a village of traditional houses nestled in South Korea's very urban capital. If you're not visiting the countryside, coming here somehow gives you an idea of the how things used to be before all the modernization happened. So peaceful to walk along and observe the traditional Korean architecture since the village discourages very loud noise from visitors as a lot of these houses are still being resided in.For the ""complete historic experience"" it's nice to go around in hanbok and have your photo taken here. And while you're at it, might as well continue the day in a hanbok visiting the Gyeongbukgong and/or Changdokgung palaces nearby."
Back to Joson Era with this civilized well decorated Villege,"The villege are well build, some foods and shopping along the way. Recommend to walk from Angkuk station along to the Bukchon villege to Kyongbokgung palace. This will consume around 4-6 hours in total (uncluding brief cafe hopping) to see it all around."
Not what expected ,"The walk through the village was nice, but not much more than a stroll through traditional Korean homes. Gives a good perspective of traditional homes, but very little shopping. A few places for tea. "
Cultural and best palce to take a picture ,This place is so cultural. Many traditional architecture houses and tea rooms. You can have many good photo spots here. 
Time travel,This little village set atop a hill takes you back in time and lets you see how civilization was back then
Self tour,Was lucky enough to have a local Korean friend take me walking through this area. Worth the walk to see the traditional architecture and visit the homes.
Hanbok rental ,The shop is a bit hard to find as it is located at the underground floor. It’s only three minutes walk to changdeokgung palace. Their service is very good and friendly. Price ok and have many types of hanbok for rent. 
A bit underwhelming...,This village is somewhat interesting and offers some nice views over the city. If you are into art then there are plenty of galleries within the village but I didn't really get a quaint feel from it. It's hard to be charmed when you pass by several international stores that are geared towards tourists who like to shop. What happened to the Korean-ness of this place?
"My favorite neighborhood in Seoul: Picturesque historic buildings, hipster cafes, and palaces!","Bukchon is a gorgeous neighborhood full of beautifully restored historic hanok buildings interspersed with hipster cafes, small artsy boutiques, and traditional Korean restaurants. There are two parts to the area. West Bukchon is bordered on the west by Gwanghwamun Palace and contains arts-related attractions like the National Museum of Contemporary Art, the Hyundai Gallery, and many others. West Bukchon is full of established boutiques, restaurants, and cafes. Many people take photos along the high palace walls and in front of White Birch Story Cafe because the popular K-Drama ""Goblin"" was filmed here. This is also where you'll find Artee Riders pedicab tour company - book a tour and enjoy a glass of vin chaud in their cafe, but leave room for a hottoek (Korean deep-fried doughnut filled with cinnamon, sugar and seeds) at the stand across the alley. West Bukchon also has the huge, flagship Wood and Brick bakery and restaurant, which is definitely worth a visit for excellent salads, sandwiches, pastries, and coffee. East Bukchon is just across the busy road called Bukchon-ro and is bordered on the east by Changdeokgung Palace. This area has the most picturesque streets and lavishly restored hanok houses - you could spend hours wandering the hilly alleyways taking photos everywhere. There is also a main shopping street in this area, that has more hipster, independent establishments like industrial-chic cafes and a bespoke tailor/whiskey bar called Knockers where they play Frank Sinatra and is run by the most stylish father-son duo you'll ever meet.If you only have one day in Seoul I highly recommend spending it exploring Insadong, Bukchon, either or both of the major Palaces, Gwangwhamun Square, and maybe pop into Jogyesa Buddhist Temple. They are all so conveniently located and everything is easily walkable."
Walk back in time to how ancient Korean houses looked like.,"It was a pleasant surprise to see that it was not just a tourist site. It was in fact a living, breathing, real life residential community that has successfully preserved old Korea look and feel. We had to be quiet while admiring the houses as actual residents were in their houses. Everything was picture-perfect and we spent quite some time posing at beautiful streets lined with quaint Korean houses."
Pretty,"Don't fool yourself into thinking that this place is very close to the palace. It is quite a bit of a walk. Recommend taking a taxi. Taxis are much cheaper in Seoul as compared to a lot of other countries in the East or West. The village is on both sides of the road and there are a few points from where you get good photos. Steep climb and not stroller friendly, No baby changing stations.The place is pretty though. We had our GInseng chicken soup in one of the nearby restaurants which was fab."
Must visit!,"I recommend you to rent hanbok (traditional korean costume) & take tons of photos! Love getting lost & going through back alleys. You will find lots of quaint cafes, boutique shops & the amazing Korean building architecture which takes you back in time!"
Short visit,It is nice to walk around and take photos in front of the traditional houses but not much to do here. There are a few shops but not very many and when I have taken guests jere both trips have been short. This would be a good site to take a guided tour if that is offerred to get a better understanding of what you are looking at.
"Organized, well maintained & beautiful","Traditional korean houses neighbourhood,well maintained and clean. U need to lower down your volume as to not disturb the residents living in the area. I managed to find kokdu museum which sells pretty souvenirs & there are cafes as you stroll along the neighbourhood. "
A taste of the past!,"I highly recommend visiting the village, although it is set apart from the rest of the tourist area. I took a free tour offered by the city's tourism department, which took me to two museums, gave me some history of the city, and had great views! The day I went was quiet, although the guide said usually there were a lot more people. There are also some places to get Korean street food, some traditional tea houses, and a few shops with clothing and souvenirs."
Ok,It's a residential area. Nothing much to see but old houses. Nice cheap stores in the area. Close to some palaces. Clean streets.
Amazing!,"It's amazingly beautiful place! So aunthetic and quite. Also, many interesting traditional coffee shops and museums here. "
Didn't see this as that worth it.,"This is a residential area with some korean themed houses, there is nothing much else to do in this area. I wouldn't not make it a priority."
Quaint houses,"Beautiful Hanoks, the street view was very nice. At the time we went, several Hanoks were under construction. It could be more picture perfect."
Lovely traditional stroll,"One of the top tourist attractions in Seoul. Small houses with decorative roofs, traditional tea houses and small gift shops. A Korean TV show was filming when we were there. Nice view of the city from the top of the hill."
Beautiful Korean Village,"The village has alot of spaces to take pictures in, a couple of houses are open for display and don't require entrance fee for. You can easily spend half a day exploring this area taking your time to take pictures. Lots of shops also rent out hanboks for the ultimate Korean experience."
Wonderful,"Wonderful attractions of Seoul. understand the history not Korea, Seoul & it's culture. Cultural programs also happens. "
Nation Korean soul,Located near Gyeongbokgung Palace Village is very beautiful and feel to much national there. Also through sreets there are places where u may rent national clothes and may take photo in the streets. For me its on most 5 things to do in Seoul
Trek,"If a semi heritage self tour is what you want to do, this is one of them. Old houses and new houses with the era architecture. (Although there are new styles). It is a walking tour so be prepared. It should be mentioned that this place sits on a hill, so there is a good deal of climbing. We were there during the winter and I would imagine the place during the summer where it would be hard finding a shade. There are places selling snacks in the base of the hill, but again, it is a walk. "
Nice village for a stroll ,"I went there to kill some time during a layover of my flight. It was easy to get there by underground and then to have a nice walk around the area. It’s actually a residential area which still bears the traditional style of old times Korea. Unfortunately you can’t enter the houses since they are private, but there are some photogenic spots and also some nice tea houses and shops. "
Not much to see,"There's really not much to see here except houses in traditional Korean architecture. I went before lunchtime, so there weren't a lot of people, and the area was exceptionally quiet (there are signs all around saying to not make a lot of noise since families actually still live in the houses). "
Disappointing,"We were here as it's one of the must visit places in Seoul and we were anticipating to visit this village. We followed the map, and unfortunately couldn't find the exact location so we kept walking up and down the slopes until we saw a lot of other tourists and yup, that's the place. It was crowded with tourists and signs boards were everywhere asking passersby to be silent as it's a residential area. Wooden structures of the traditional houses were interesting but the crowds, the over expectations of this place and weariness of finding the right place just put off the excitements of visiting this place.Good for first timer to Seoul but don't expect too much. "
Interesting place to visit but not a must~,"I went there with a friend and was amazed by the traditional houses - i mean the whole area was actually filled with those type of houses like those you saw in their dramas. But Its a bit disappointing as it was actually a real residential area and you can only see it from the outside. We manage to go in one of the residence - Baek In Jae House. It was really huge and he even have his own reading pavilion! the house were well kept but...we are not allowed to step in the house, so we just stroll around. But i like the environment tho! Along the narrow road you can find few souvenir shops, but its a bit pricey as it was unique and not like those souvenirs we buy in bulks. Most of the items sold were those made in small quantities and they look very precious and artistic to me. I end up buying their Korean biscuit - unfortunately I forgot the name... Its super yummy!!!!"
A must do for photo opportunities,Did a small walkabout the area as it wasn't too far off GYBHK palace. Nice quaint place for pics and even rent traditional wear and snacks.
Interesting place but was disappointed,"I was looking forward to seeing the old building. BUt this is actual residential homes, so you can only see it from the outside. And have to be mindful to keep it quiet. IT was also hilly, so walk is quite tough."
Experience the past ,"Well preserved and maintained traditional housing village. Rather hilly to walk around but absolutely fascinating place to visit and stay! There are many traditional style inns with modern setup for your convenience where you can even cook your own meals. Many cute stores, where sell handmade jewellery, good quality leather goods and so much more! "
Just ok but worth a visit,"There is no much to do but to walk and take pictures. It was confused for us to find the starting point. So we just walked from where we were, still not knowing if we have missed part of the route. The houses are traditional and well maintained. Must come here one time if you visit Seoul."
PAST SCENT,A NICE TO PLACE TO VISIT. has nothing to impress you its just nice. to hang out and see how old days houses and suburban's in Seoul lives. I wouldn't vistt again if I had the chance
Very cozy place ,If you want to just chill with your friends i do recommend this place. It’s 10 min taxi drive from anguk station. They have very interesting Cousins and cafe with comic books 
Lovely tourist attraction,A lovely village with many old traditional Korean houses. Saw many tourists wearing hanbok and took pictures. it is a bit of uphill and downhill climb but worth it since the view is good!
Family vacation,It have many historical buildings and the structure are unique. It was well preserved and very clean. Many tourists came here to visit. 
Beautiful tourist attraction,It is a nice village with traditional Korean houses which enhance the beauty of this place. There are many view points from where beauty of nature can be enjoyed. One has to walk a lot & a little bit uphill too to explore this village . There are not many dustbins in Seoul. Its better to carry a plastic bag for trash while exploring the city. This village is full of life with many tourists. Palaces & temples enhance the beauty of this village.
Very touristy,A nice village with old traditional Korean houses. People live in them so it is advised to walk quiet. The roads are nice to walk along but it feels very touristy with many tourist aimed businesses at these houses. 
Beautiful,Absolutely serene neighbourhood with traditional style homes. It's a bit of an uphill climb but worth the view when you get to the top. You'll need to be quiet though as people still live in the village. There are shops + restaurants lining the climb that are also worth visiting.
Pick up a Free Map,We picked up a free map in the area of the Bukchon Hanok Village. I would advise getting a map. You don't need a guide. The map and the staff will tell you the best route to walk. It is pretty popular with tourists and some even rent the traditional costumes for photography. Keep in mind this is a residential area so refrain from talking loudly.We enjoyed walking around and seeing the historic architecture.
If you've never been... A must stop,Been to Seoul many trips but this time tool the effort to visit. It will be a sure stop next trips. Such a lovely place to spend the afternoon. The houses were magnificent and gorgeous. Found an ahjumma selling hotteok and it's simply divine. So so good. Only wish I could eat more than one... 
Serene and enchanting residential area,"We liked the whole relaxing atmosphere of Bukchon. The houses were beautiful and we also chanced upon a 'shop' selling candles and perfumes/oils. Some of the scents were really unusual so we could not resist buying some. Overall, it was a relaxing afternoon for us and although we would have liked to wear a hanbok like some of the other tourists, it was too cold for us."
Goto the observatory ,"We followed the signage to the observatory. It's on the top floor of a building in the area. Paid 3,000won/adult for the entrance fees. Quite a stunning view but it's not something that you will view for hours. We sat in the observatory area for half hour to rest our legs after all the walking, took pics and left. "
Peaceful place in Seoul,"we could see really peaceful and traditional village in the middle of Seoul. It was fabulous to see skyscrapers in Seoul from the traditional village, such as a combination of modern and traditional one.I used the map I got from the entrance well since without the map, it is probably easy to get lost or miss some spots to see.There are some shops to buy gifts or beverages at the beginning of the village, so it was quite enjoyable!Also left side of the village, there are restaurants and cafes, so we could have a nice meal at there!One thing I was uncomfortable was that there wasn’t any trash bin on the street"
Travel in time,"Seoul is one of the most modern megacities in Asia I have come across, also with the least amount of old buildings left. Bukchon is a travel in time. Unfortunately also for the residents it has become a tourist attraction. I spent as much time taking pictures of Chinese tourists posing as viewing old houses."
Very authentic! Full of locals (and tourists too),Go on weekend. It's very croud but very authentic! A lot o locals go there and there are places to rent traditional costumes for you to take pictures. I have amazing pictures of locals with there costumes. Some nice places to eat to.
Beautiful but nothing special,"Beautiful streets, but walking here is quite annoying because it's either uphill or downhill. They have stores here as well as food stalls."
Preserved traditional houses in the city,"This neighborhood is close to Insadong, and approximately 15min walk from Gyeongbokgung palace.It was well-signed, so feel free to wander and appreciate this cute little neighbourhood. The contrast of old and new, busy and peaceful, modern and traditional of Seoul It is an active residential area so there were signs to keep noise to a minimum.Cafes and little souvenir shops were aplenty. There were several public toilets too. The stroll can range from normal straight level to several hill slopes depending on which route is taken."
Remainders of old-time Seoul,"Mixed old and new residential buildings, including some of few left traditional Hanoi houses. Many restaurants. Several workshops and one hanok house converted into a museum. Easy to access by metro, a nice one hour walk giving an idea how Seoul looked in old times. "
Silence is golden,"The village is located nearer to one of Seoul's major palaces, Changdeokgung. You can get off at the Anguk, and start looking for groups of giggling hanbok-wearing girls (locals + tourists) making their way somewhere. Chances are they're heading to this village for their cutesy photos. This is a residential area where traditional houses are preserved for modern day use. You'll find average looking houses interspersed with grand structures with formidable gates. However, do remember that there are real people living inside these houses, so a little consideration for their peace will be much appreciate. Silence is golden."
Lovely to stroll,"Located near the major palaces in north Seoul, this village is free to walk. The streets consist mainly of residences so don't expect much in terms of shopping. Yido pottery and KwangJuYo Pottery are nearby if you want the best in Korean ceramics, however."
Great village especially with a walking tour,"Had a great time by taking a Seoul City Walking Tour of Bukchon Hanok Village - in total the duration was around 2-3 hours and the guide spoke extremely good English. We enjoyed it a lot, and definitely think we enjoyed it more than we would have if we just walked around on our own"
Beautiful place to stroll,I really enjoyed taking a walk just to look at the streets and buildings. Great place to take photos if you're renting a traditional Hanbok. 
"Nice stroll, good for a few pictures ","If you happen to be around, it’s worth it to stop by for a few pictures, but there’s nothing that special to do.Somehow I feel that the people around prefer not to be disturbed by tourists."
Nothing much to see,"We took a trip down specially to this village. To be honest there wasn’t much to see except a few streets with some older looking architecture. There’s shops renting hanbok, which adds on slightly to the experience. Wouldn’t recommend a special trip to this place unless architecture and history are your thing. "
Interesting,"I visited Bukchon Hanok Village, with a friend and it was really interesting to see a traditional style village, which is actually still a residential area. Lots of people walking around in Hanbok. Nice observation point where you can have a glimpse of the city. "
Early Morning Visit,"We were staying in a hanok (Irang Guesthouse - highly recommended) in Bukchon Hanok Village. Hence we could explore the area and the famous 8 sights early in the morning, before tour buses arrive.The other advantage of staying in the village was that we can start from the top (near 3rd view), and walk down. (So many friends who started from Anguk Station complained that there were many slopes to climb.)It was a lovely morning walk, and we found it interesting to meander around hanoks which are lived-in (and not museum pieces). There was some construction near 6th view, which was a pity as this was one of my favourite views.Enjoy..."
Feels like you're in the past,"Lovely street to stroll around and admire the architecture of the houses. It's also a residential area so it's recommended to not make too much noise. However, there are a lot of tourists taking the opportunity to take photos in every building which can be annoying. Also, it's very near to Changdeokgung Palace and Samcheong-Dong."
Soul of Seoul,Samcheong dong is a quaint neighbourhood just east of Gyeongbokgung palace. It's filled with small cafes and restaurants; art galleries and museums as well as boutiques. Here you may also find some colourful murals and interesting art installations. You can walk through Samcheong dong en route to the Bukchon traditonal Hanok village which is very close by and a great way to experience some Korean culture and history.
Good afternoon walk,Great place for an afternoon walk. Lots of cafes and what not to stop for break. Very enjoyable with good views
Very cool place to visit,We have visited this village through a free walking tour and it was great. Tour guide showed us few unique architectural characteristics of the Korean buildings.
Historical buildings and streer,"For me it’s nothing special. Just some small street with old fashioned house. Anyway, it’s quite historical as new building are everywhere in the city. Not a must-go in Seoul. "
Touristy but good,"One will have a more pleasant experience if one goes early and beats the crowds. There are a few quirky shops and photographers will have a good chance for some memorable shots.Go early, though. "
Interesting traditional village in the city,Walked around this traditional village for about 2 hours. Checked out traditional houses which partly have been converted to restaurants and shops.
"Neat, but not necessary","The are is neat. If you're looking for a nice walk, then this place is worth going to. The pictures basically capture what you'd see so you won't miss much not going. It's a little hard to find the right alleys so make sure you get your hands on a map that shows you the route that you need to walk. You can find one at the cultural centre or with one of the tourist helpers that stand around some intersections."
Authentic Korea,"Excellent in every way; especially if, like my girlfriend, you have a lifelong interest in wearing a Hambock dress which you can hire for around 20,000 KRW for 2 hours. The buildings are mostly private so enjoy the authenticity in a respectful manner."
Great place to visit! We loved it! ,"My wife an I spent several hours wandering around here. A brief flurry of snow at the start of the day added to the occasion. We went to the museum first and the helpful gentleman there furnished us with a map, which was useful. We followed the suggested route. There are lots of nice old buildings, and plenty of photo opportunities.There are also several places where traditional Korean clothing can be hired, if you are that way inclined.Overall a wonderful experience! We loved it. "
Very unique place,"Always we seen from TV drama, should drop by to see. Subway can reach. But need a walking distance, about 20 mins. If happen you lost, there is a tourist person. Who dress in red t-shirt & black pant & with a hat. They can guide you to the area.Once you reach ""Bukchon hanok village:, must be quiet . That location still is a resident area. Of course, you can enjoy the place and houses."
Traditional districts with nice walks,"More authentic than Insa-dong, BHV offers a few quiet walks along narrow lanes, mostly car-free. A nice rest from the busy capital, and an interesting way to discover a more authentic side of Korea. A bit hilly, wear good shoes. Be sure to grab a map at the visitor centre.The closest station in Anguk."
Evening was better time ,"We went to there on Evening time(around 1800~1900). This time, The Village haven’t many people to take pictures with Korea traditional cloth so we could see and took picture with only us Also we could see Soul tower from top of the village."
fast walking course for me,"This place is some neighborhood that full of Korean traditional house. It's full of cafe's and some craft studios. The architectural and structure is amazing, but for you who visit this place just for taking nice photo's you better visit this place in the morning, because it will full with tourist that you will hard to find nice spot to take photo's. And because this place is a neighborhood which is people still live in the house, so you can not walk loudly, and you need to mind the person who live in the house if you want to take photo's in front of their house door."
Traditional Housing,Such a cool thing to see while in the city that there are still old fashioned looking homes. They’re out of the way and somewhat easy to locate. They’re real homes that people still live in so make sure you’re quiet while visiting the Bukchon Hanok Village. 
Gorgeous-Must,Caught the sunset from up above! So beautiful! Walking around the old town was peaceful and scenic. Check it out for sure!
Quick walk through,"It’s a small community with some traditional and modern architectural low rise buildings. It is a real community with shops, restaurants, convenience stores, restaurants ,schools , church,etc. The major added bonus in this community is that there are many hanbok shops and few tea houses. There were few restaurants where several Korean TV programs filmed and commented. It is a good place to take pictures and enjoy a meal. "
Quick tour on a Saturday,We really enjoyed touring this village as it had old world charm and showcased the traditional homes and the korean style charming village. It’s a wonderful place for the foreign tourist to get a quick intro to old Korea. We had much fun people watching and enjoyed some traditional hot tea at the tea house. We highly recommend this place as a destination in Seoul. 
Not impressed,"It's too commercialised, shops everywhere. Shops are more attractive than culture. I'm not very impressed."
Nice Cultural Village To Wander Around,"Has quite a bit to see and do. It is a real village with current residents living beside attractions and museums for tourists. They offer workshops for several traditional arts like calligraphy, knot tying, arts and crafts for a reasonable price. I regret not planning in advance. But if you have time, go explore and make reservations for later. Classes are run every day. They take as little as 30 mins to half a day."
Ancient views,"From Gyeongbokgung Palace we walked to Bukchon Hanok Village. We got lost and good thing we found information center where they give you a map but they don't speak a lick of english. There are 2 areas of the village and we chose the left side entrance of the road. We rented hanbok for only 1 hour. Rental for an hour is 10,000 won while 5,000 won for the hair arrangement, 1,000 won for the peticot and another 1,000 won for the locker where you keep your belongings while you roam around the village. Many tourists flock the area in the afternoon so better be early if you want to have a moment on your own with no photobombers. The village is very quiet and the houses are picturesque. If only one owner of the house would allow tourists to enter his house then that would be great. We can see the actual beauty of the house inside out. It's also possible to see the inside beauty because there are houses that turned into a guesthouse but very pricey compared to other hotels. All in all its good."
Authentic ,Not so crowded and many hip independent shops among Korean traditional houses. Good place for walk! I highly recommend here. My favorite place in Seoul 
Hanok. Come early in the morning to avoid the crowd,"Came here early before I went to Gyeongbokgung Palace. The area is so photogenic, everywhere is a photo spot. As it is a residential area, there are signs urging tourists to keep the noise level down. It is a refreshing experience seeing how old Korean houses look like and comparing it to the high rises that they have now."
Nice ancient area,"It is a complex of old villages in the centre of Seoul. It took us a while to figure out the most popular place where there are full of tourists. Again, when you come to popular places, try to beat the crowds by starting the trip early. The villages are beautiful but guests are expected to make less noise as people are still living there. Many of the houses become guest houses so you can come there and stay. It is on the hill so it might be difficult for old people. "
Quaint village in the city,The Bukchon Hanok village is a lovely area just next to one of the big palaces. The traditional architecture is interesting.
it's a unique residential,"this place is private quarters for many locals so behave, be quiet and respectful. similar to walking through a french village, you could take photos of the unique architecture. bring good cameras. one of the road has namsan tower in the background "
"Bukchon Hanok Village, Seoul",This fascinating area of Seoul is on the tourist route and demonstrates some of the earlier Korean way of living and architecture. Well worth a visit.
Bukchon Hanok Village,This area is gorgeous and very historic. People still live here. It tends to get very busy so plan to go in off-peak times. It’s great to be able to see such a preserved piece of Korean history.
Korean for a day,We visit bukchon hanok village and dress up in hanbook to feel “koreans for a day” and took loads of photos. Be mindful of noise as this is an actual neighborhood where people live. Great little nooks and alleys for photo opp.
Small Narrow Maze-like Street but Full of Beautiful Korean Traditional Houses,"Enjoyed maze like street full of Korean traditional old houses. Amazingly people still lives in those houses. Watching roof tops at higher place was spectacular. If you are not sure about navigating street, join the short tour. But lost in the maze would be a fun too (if you have time)"
Nice stroll:),You will see traditional style houses preserved like in the old days situated not too far from the urbanized Seoul:) I felt like I time travelled in an instant:) There are people walking around on their hanbok dresses so it’s so fun and educational at the same time!
Can be skipped,"When one reads the blogs and travel books, this place is written up as more exciting than it is. Yes there are Korean houses on this cliffside community. But thats it. If I had known, considering our very limited time, I would just check it out on line. The time could have been used for other activities where being present would have made a difference to our experience."
Must Visit!,It was truly an amazing experience!The rental of the costumes were seamless and the lady was really helpful. The were information staff stationed at different parts of the village and they speak English and were extremely helpful.It was a beautiful village and worth the visit for anyone visiting Seoul the first time. 
Traditional architecture for a quiet walk,"This neighbourhood is where the traditional Korean houses (hanok) are located. Some houses are centuries years old and while most of these houses are still occupied by actual living people, some have turned them into shops selling teas, souvenirs, food, perfumes, etc. Good place to have leisurely strolls or people-watching while taking a sip of tea or a bite of pastry."
Heritage Visit,This is our first time exploring this place. We love their house building & their culture. They also have nice cosy cafes & restaurants. It's a must go if going to Seoul as we don't always get to see traditional house building & structure.
Amazing,"Surrounded by Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace and Jongmyo Shrine, Bukchon Hanok Village is home to hundreds of traditional houses, called hanok, that date back to the Joseon Dynasty. The name Bukchon, which literally translates to ""northern village,"" came about as the neighborhood lies north of two significant Seoul landmarks, Cheonggyecheon Stream and Jongno. Today, many of these hanoks operate as cultural centers, guesthouses, restaurants and tea houses, providing visitors with an opportunity to experience, learn and immerse themselves in traditional Korean culture,.... a must see in Seoul."
Traditional Korea,"Bukchon Hanok Village was amazing! Filled with quirky shops, delicious food and traditional architecture. It's surrounded by palaces, galleries and museums so if you plan your day you can walk through Bukchon whilst visiting palaces and galleries. "
"Not a typical village as you would expect, however full of character and arty shops","This was a very pleasant area to walk around, lots of craft type shops and many smaller clothes shops. There a number of small museums in the village area including a typical Korean house.There were many local tourist guides around offering free advice and maps. Each time you came to a fork on the map a guide seemed to magically appear with directions, so efficient.Plant places to eat and drink in the area.Well worth a visit."
Quiet Stroll in the morning with Traditional teashops,Viewing old traditional houses gives you some nostalgic feel to the the culture. Traditional architecture of the Hanok house acquaints the visitor on the wisdom of how the hanoks were built with surrounding materials available with a view of the family as a basic social unit and the how the community lived. And it is a good contrast with nearby vibrant Samcheong-dong area and Seoul’s cafe culture.
Love this village!!,Love this village!! Visited in the month of October and the weather is just right that makes this place feel so comfortable. They do have much cafe choices in this area. Will definitely come n visit again next time
A must to see when in Seoul,"We used the a Lonely Planet walking tour plan which was quite successful as we are both good walkers and not afraid of hills. The village is well preserved with many old houses with original roofs. It's sort of upmarket touristy, with not too many tacky souvenir shops, although several tourists were wandering around in traditional clothes they had hired taking selfies."
Traditional Korean houses,"The Bukchon Hanok Village is a charming village with lots of traditional Korean houses called “hanok”. Some of these houses go back to the times of the Joseon Dynasty. Bukchon lies north of the Cheonggyecheon Stream. At the time of my visit, various tourists hired local costumes and dressed up in the traditional way. There were a few shops selling souvenir items and snacks. The village has guesthouses and tea rooms. In essence the hanoks are like small culture centres where you can learn and gain experience of traditional Korean culture. It would be best to take the metro to Anguk station and walk from there. Admission is free.You should aim to spend between sixty to ninety minutes here."
What’s all the hype ?? ,Small houses have been ‘preserved’ according to korean tradition. Beautiful handicrafts and aesthetic architecture but apart from that horde of tourists clogging up narrow alleys does actually take away the charm. Understably local residents would like tourists to be quiet as possible but the cacophony of increasing decibels can be unbearable. Definitely not for a second visit. 
"Residential Area, good for a wander around!",We cheated and took a taxi to the highest point in the village and then walked down ! It is a lovely little village with houses still faithful to the original buildings. We spent a few hours looking around and checking out the little museums and coffee shops. 
Different for non-asian people,I had couple of hours before I leave for my flight. I went there. Nice place to see. You can see how the historical houses are and they are still residential and some of tgem renovated. Worth to see if you are close. 
A Walk in History,This place is literally a neighborhood for residents. They just kept their houses looking like the old houses. It is advised to keep quite here. There is a bit of walk for you here but literally almost everything looks the same.I recommend you spend 30mins to 1 hour in this place.
"Know what to expect, look for and do as part of a day of attractions","The Hanok Village is neat to see, but if you come just as an attraction itself it might be a bit disappointing. Since it is so close to Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace, Jongmyo Shrine and Insadong you should try to visit all of these things as well as the Hanok Village as they are all within walking distance.It was neat to see the buildings and there are shops where you can dress up in traditional dress and take pictures along the way as well.Things to Note:1) Keep your voices down as it is still a neighborhood where people live2) There are wonderful tea houses, I recommend you stop at one for the experience and the view. An example would be Cha Masinuen Tteul, located along Bukchon-ro 5 na gil3) There are several must see views while in the Bukchon Hanok Village. ""Bukchon 8 Views"" is where people can fully enjoy the beauty of hanoks and the alleys in the area. Seoul has nominated eight different views and has set up ""Photo Spots,"" from which you can easily find delight in the surroundings inside of Bukchon in order to develop the area as a Seoul’s most representative cultural tourist attraction. Reserach them before you go so you don't miss one :)I would probably allocate an hour or two at the most to the village if you include the tea stop."
"Expected a bit more, but still worth a visit","Having missed this on my previous visit to Seoul, I decided to make it a point to visit the village on my next visit. It's quite a hit and miss for me.Hits- The architecture in the area is a great study into how the traditional houses, called hanok, were made.- Some of the houses actually allow you experience, learn and immerse themselves in traditional Korean culture.Misses- So much reconstruction has been done to the area, it made me feel like being in a exhibition, rather than being part of history of the city.- Too many Hanbok-dorned tourists, who don't adhere to the rules (keeping your voices down as it is, after all, still a neighbourhood where people actually live), and that creates quite an unpleasant experience.I can only blame myself for not having included it as part of my list when visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace, Jongmyo Shrine and Insadong, as they are all within walking distance of one another! if you're going to plan a visit, I'd set aside an hour for this place."
Pretty area,A pretty area to walk around but it might be best to go with a tour as that would be more meaningful.
Explore Jeju Island,"We were welcomed by a very sweet and professional volunteer . She explained about the History of the village with so much fun. Then were brought to a room where she promoted their products. Wow, very expensive! Even the bottle of honey costs more than RM100. "
Loved visiting this village,"We loved visiting this street. The little shops are cute, and it is a great place to get a tea. Would go here again. "
Always fun to roam the alleyways,"On a sunny beautiful day, the views are spectacular. Fun to roam around taking pictures and photos of all the ladies dressed up in Hanbok taking selfies. Cute art galleries and cafes in the surrounding neighborhood between here and the gyeongbongdong palace."
Nice walk to see Korean traditional houses,"Couldn't find the place last year and would have failed too this year although we have the ""Korean version of its location"" to the taxi driver. Luckily came across the Seoul Hanok center where the nice lady there gave us a detailed map of the area including a suggested walking route to see all there was to see. The major areas were a bit busy with everyone wanting to take photos and selfies but the majority of the path was quiet and very peaceful to explore.Came across the ""observatory"" which is actually someone's rooftop home where he charges for access to take photos. This can be skipped though. Also found a nice Korean tea house along the way that serves excellent tea in a tranquil and beautiful Korean traditional house setting."
Worth a Stop,"This beautiful traditional Korean neighborhood is worth a walk through. It won’t take but maybe two hours or so out of your day, but is a quaint little place to see"
Traditional Architecture.,"It is very sad that there are tour guide services. But it is worth to visit if you love traditional Korean style or Traditional Architecture.But please read and prepare the related information before going there. Since there are famous 8 views.If you didn’t read the information, you may miss the view. Please quite during visiting. It is because still a lot of residents living there.It is very sad that there are tour guide services.

good but. .,"A few places where you can see traditional Korean houses in Seoul. Very good place. The residents are still living, but the Chinese tourists are lousy."
Traditional houses & many cafes ,Nice area gives nice scent of traditional Korean-style. Many cafes and nice places to have a cup of tea or snacks.
Nice walk ,"After the visit of the palace we went to the village walking around the shops and houses. It offer variety of cosmetics, hand made shops which offer classes, coffee shops with nice atmosphere. Worth going for sure."
Filled with traditional craftspeople and great old homes,This is a great hilly area to walk around. You get sweeping views over the tiled roof tops and also many traditional craft workshops and stores are to be found here. Take the walk and also the area just south and east of it is worth the stroll as well.
Traditional Korea Neighborhood ,"Its a sight seeing area where you can see traditional Korea housing. Just a short distance, with 10 minutes walk you can see everything in this neighborhood. Don't forget to take lots of pictures. "
Wandering around in Joseon kind alleys,"There are lot of shop offers cheap hanbok rental as u wish to wander around the alleys and take cute picture. Its advisable to not make noise as this alleys now become residential area. Take time to walk around as enjoy the fine architerature arts. And there also convenient store, cafe and galleries around. "
"Houses where rich government officials stay, climbing up the slope is not easy","The view was great and very ancient. Feels like Kyoto. If you have issues with legs, suggest to get a cab up there. The stairs will drain your energy."
Very cosy place you really feel to be in a village and not in Seoul,"You can get lost in the Street of this very cosy place, really feeling to be in a village and not in Seoul"
Tour guide would be helpful,We were lost looking for this place as it is spread out and not very well signed. I would have enjoyed hearing about the place through a guide. Go when you aren't tired. The teriyaki chicken stick and beer saved the afternoon for me!
Downhill walking,"An interesting sreet full of people during the Chuseok. Restaurants, cafes shops, life on the street. This time also beautiful Korean national dresses."
It is a collection of old traditional Korean houses,"This is an area where ordinary people live. Many houses are in traditional Korean form, but not sure whether they are newly built or historical. They are all similar so after a while you feel so so."
Beautiful and traditional,"Loved how everyone were wearing hanbok. Village is full of cute shops, where you can spend all your money on beautiful Korean made clothes. Prices are little bit cheaper than Myeongdong shopping street. From village you can walk to the Palace. "
Fantastic,"Loved this place. Real authentic and lots a photo ops. Many small shops and restaurants, traditional houses. Excellent tea houses here and there. Bukchon was the highlight of my Seoul trip."
One of my favorite places as Seoulite!,"As a girl who lives in Seoul, here is one of my favorite places in the city. When my foreign friends come to visit, I never skip to bring them here. 1. Bukchon Hanok Village is traditional residence areas in a peaceful and calm atmosphere. 2. This area is connected to Samchung-dong main street where you can visit pretty cafes, cosmetics shops, art galleries, and fine restaurants! 3. There are plenty of shops to rent Korean traditional clothes called Hanbok in this area. With wearing Hanbok and walking around the village, you can enjoy the old town 100%."
Place of history,It is good to see how living conditions were many years ago. Our tour guide was able to explain for better understanding to tourist. Many locals in the area due to holiday season. It a nice small village reach in history.
Authentic Korean life - must see,"Bukchon Hanok Village, I was told, is the only Hanok area in Seoul that actually has people living in them as homes today, whereas other Hanok villages are made for tourism show purposes and are not lived in. We didn't get to see inside of an Hanok but just to walk around the area was pleasant enough. There were several quaint cafes and boutiques that made the place feel like a cool hangout area. The area is pretty large. Be prepared to walk a lot to cover them all,"
Love this place!,"Love walking this area because it really feels like you are walking inside a real life Korean drama scene in the olden times. Do wear comfortable shoes though as there is alot of walking to do. You can also rent a hanbok for an hour or two to walk around the area. It's definitely worth a photo shoot. Also, you can visit the high school that was used for filming in Winter Sonata (yes, it's a long time drama, but still worth a visit. We all love Korean dramas don't we? :))."
A walk through culture and history,"I suggest you include this in your itinerary if you are interested to see traditional houses in Seoul. Get a map from the tourist information center. Not sure if seeing students in their hanbok is common but it was truly a nice scene when they are around the area. Wear comfortable shoes and I think it is nicer if it will be done in the morning or during sunset. It has 2 different areas and you can easily get lost in the small alleys and small stairways but never fear because there are a lot of tourist around. You must schedule this on a day where you won't feel pressured walking around. The more you pay attention to the details of the houses the more it will be interesting.Before you go, check what else you can do because I noticed that there are cooking classes or some sort of art classes around there too. Also, if the news shows that there are a lot of people on streets on rally/picketing around the King Sejong statue then avoid this area as no cabs will take you there or pick you up if it is late at night.I also recommend that you stay around this area, its quite a good place to experience traditional houses and it is also close to the tourist hot spots. There was one area with a lot of good food and office workers are actually dine there."
Very interesting,It is an interesting experience walking on the streets of this village surrounded by traditional korean houses. There are even visitors dressed in hanbok. I feel like being transported to joseon dynasty.
Great place to view traditional architecture.,Recent history of Korea has been very tragic and many things have been destroyed by nearby nations throughout history. As such being able to view Bukchon through the eyes that this village allows us a glimpse into something that has been destroyed is enlightening. Going on a day in fall where the weather is nice and it is not busy is awesome. You are able to take many pictures with the scenic spots and there are quite a few cafes and shops to drop by as well. Overall I thoroughly recommend going here and keep in mind the tragic history of this area as well.For more on Bukchon check out my website in my profile.
Really beautiful ,We have spent entire day with our 3 small children walking small beautiful streets of this village. Enjoyed it a lot! Highly recommend.
Feel like local,"Today (5/10/17) our next stop is Bukchon Hanok Village. We came here by subway from our Hotel (Nine Tree Premier) stop at Anguk Station. Take Exit 3 at Anguk Station and just go straight, the village located around 600m from Exit 3. There are few shop provide rental for Hanbok on your right sight heading to Bukchon. You can rent your Hanbok before proceed to village.Few restaurant also available at this area. We have our lunch Korean Restaurant just outside Exit 3.From this Bukchon Hanok Village you can walk to Geongbukyong Palace or just go back to Anguk station & take subway to Geongbukyong Station which is on the next stop.However we did not go to the palace, instead we took subway to Yeouinaru station for Hangang ARA Cruise. "
Interesting Section of Seoul,"OK residential area to walk around in and grab pictures. There will be some small exhibits, cafes, and vendors around. Avoid during humid or hot summer days, there's a serious lack of shade and a ton of uphill areas."
Beautiful street to look around,You can find beautiful traditional house and street in this place. Plus you can find a cozy cafe :tea story which has really good ambience! Great place to take a time for Korean tea
Traditional village ,This is a fun place to see where people lived and continue to live in order to preserve their heritage I really enjoyed this spot though it wasn’t as exciting as I had thought check it out if you have some extra time but don’t be afraid to skip it either. 
Nice glimpse,"Nice glimpse of a traditional korean village. Unfortunately, there are a lot of ongoing construction/restoration during our visit. You can enter some houses and have a feel of korean tradition. Be on the lookout for quaint coffe shops, art studios and activities in the houses that are open.Tip: you can rent a Hanbok/traditional Korean dress and roam around in traditional attire for a ""full"" experience :)"
Historic village ,"Our favorite neighborhood in Seoul. Old meets new in this friendly and inviting neighborhood. Easy to get to by metro. Spend the morning exploring, then go find a great spot for lunch!"
Traditional Korean houses,"A popular tourist spot where we can see a lot of traditional Korean houses. Good for taking photos but some tourists are quite noisy and might disturb the residents there. It will be great if one or two houses can be open to the public.,"
Wonderful place ,Area itself where the village located are great you can just set after the visit and get drink nice clean street and village itself it's magical some few houses converted to cafe shop where you can set and enjoy the atmospheres don't forget to RENT the hanbok wear while you going around and don't miss the walking distance palace 
Nice place in seoul ,"A very iconic old neighborhood in seoul. Lovely small alleys and hanok houses. Lots of young people wearing Korean costumes, and it makes the place more picturesque "
Village,"One of the ancient village in korea which a lot of tourist come ,see ,explore how the old Koreans lived before.This village are open all year round for free admission You can also wear a traditional dress if you want,there's a store before you can enter the village It cost 20$ I think for the rent and free photo ,"
Beautiful place. ,This place has its ancient Korean look which will give all photographers chances to have their best shot. Visitors will have a chance to experience how a korean person live back to half of century. 
Lovely place!,"We had a really lovely walk around this village! I love all the traditional houses so much. We did have a talk with owners of E-oot hanok, they are super nice and friendly! A good option for those who want to experience ""night in a traditional hanok"" when in Seoul - they even offer cooking class by the owner herself! "
Overrated,"Nothing interesting, it just a few houses with korean traditional architecture. Prepare for lotsa walking."
nothing,not really ancient thou. It's good for photos. That's it. You can rent hanbok there but I suggest you should do so at some palace. 
No what I expected!,"I heard so many good comments about this place. Once I got there, I got very dissapointed. Its a little town in the middle of Seoul but nothing to do around. There is a few restaurants and shops but nothing interested. Definitely I wouldn't go back to this place. It was boring!!!"
Great to walk around,It's a quaint set of alleyways where you can get to experience Korean lifestyle and architecture. There are quite a few street performances which is well worth a pause. A lot of shopping too from the general souvenirs to the more niche hat shops. A good place to while away an hour just to experience South Korea.
Historical culture visit.,"A place worth visiting as it consists history of village residential, truly fascinating when walking and climbing the steepness hill along the residential. They're people living in that village, though its name as a village, rather, more on very much developed small town as compared to my hometown. There are a lot of steep climb along the residential area, I was just lucky because I've carry manfrotto along as had it setup steadily to avoid and beat the uneven road surface, gradient and etc. Spotted one of the houses' walls stacked up by raw bricks inside the village, taking advantage to make use of this wall to do our couple shooting. Many tourists doing their own smartphones shooting too, they were laughing why the hassle where smartphone already sufficed for the photography. I don't blame them, indeed smartphones' quality could be very good for photography, just that maybe I am still old school fella who still doing photography in an old fashion way. "
DO NOT RENT HANBOK HERE,"This place is a 15 min walk from Gyeongbokgung palace and another 15 minute walk to Changdeokgung and Cheonggyecheon palace as it is in between the palaces. It is cheaper to rent Hanbok in Gyeongbukgong as they only charge 15-18k KRW for for hours, but in bukchon hanok village it costs 10 KRW per hour so places offer rentals from 30 - 40 k KRW. ALSO DO NOT RENT HANBOK in the rental shop inside the Bukchon-ro 11 na gil street (after Etude house and can be seen as soon as you enter the street left side). THE LADY THERE ALMOST SCAMMED US! first she said that the rental for four hours was 30 KRW, as we didn't have any choice left as we didn't want to walk 15 mins back, we just agreed. And then when we already had the hanboks on they were offering hair clips, bags etc. They just put it on our head and gave it to us. Good thing we resesrched that these things have additional charges so when we asked she said yes we needed to pay extra. So we returned it and said no, we just wanted to pay for the Hanbok rental. So after putting it on and paying for it, she sat us down and pointed at the headband. She said ""already included"" and then braided our hair and gave us bags. We said, no no we just want the hanbok rental. And then she said ""sorry I made a mistake, already included."" Ok then we let her do her thing. And then after braiding our hair she was asking for 41 k KRW! because she said that she made a mistake as 30k KRW was onky for 2.5 hours and not 4, plus the braiding services bag etc. We said no we only wanted the clothes and we were refusing the add -ons since the beginning. We stood our ground and almost got very angry until she said ok. But we should've just removed the Hanbok and embarass ourselves in the store because WE SHOULDN'T have continued to rent that hanbok there! My friend sprained her ankle just minjtes after rentinf the hanbok and we adked if we cpuld just return it since we were going home and we will pay for 1 hour worth of rental fee. SHE DID NOT agree despite the situation being an emergency. Given everything she put us through she wouldn't budge even in this situation. She honestly ruined the experience for me. Bukchon Hanok Village is not worth the effort and hassle we have been put through. I feel really disappointed because the people were very accommodating, kind and agreeable until we reached Bukchon Hanok Village. So no, not worth it at all. Just go to the palaces if you would like to see and take pictures of historical architecture."
"Traditional Korean architecture, natural stair master!",Lovely traditional Korean architecture. You get a view of the city and it's a lovely way to walk off the lunch. A natural stair master! The houses are situated on hills and some parts are quite steep. So be prepared for the climb. Also there are many tourists dressed in traditional Korean outfits so it may be sometimes hard to take a photo without others inside. 
"Not worth it at all, just traditional hanok houses","Located far from subway station, walk 15 minutes go uphill, and nothing than houses.. not my type of tour, "
A fine walk,The area was fine... seemed to be a popular area for white collar lunch break. We just walked around and took in the hustle of resident life. 
"Smell history of Seoul and enjoy walking, fantastic place, don;t miss visiting please.","My friend Dimitri insist that we must visit Bukchon Hanok Village, many thanks for him for that, this is a wonderful and amazing place, it's a must visited place in Seoul, the beauty of this place is that showing Old city of Seoul, the streets are so clean, tourist guide informing you where to go, shops, resturants and coffee shops are there for you with reasonable prices, houses are for rich people (may be second house for them) or big families have houses there, you can see very luxury cars inside the houses, you can meet as well Korean with there heritage and tradition dress, they are so friendly, you need to walk for 30 minutes between the houses, I was there with my friends, Dimitri from Greece, Faten and Rana from Lebanon."
Somewhat Overrated,"Korean travelers seemed to enjoy this the most. It was interesting to see the architecture, but it is a small area and is flooded with people. I feel sorry for the residents!If you only have a couple of days in Seoul, this should not be one of your stops. The tea house where you turn right off the main street is a gem of a find though."
A residential area of traditional hanok houses,"We walked here during our walkabout in the area. It is quite near Changdeokgung Palace. We arrived in the evening before it got dark. Even then, there were lots of tourists. As this was a residential area and people were still living here, there were signs asking people to keep their voices down when visiting. There were several alleys you could wander about. It was quite interesting to look at hanok houses in the city and compare them with the many skyscrapers and modern buildings nearby. We left when it go dark."
Unique experience,Wanted to rent a hanbok to take photos with the beautiful houses but the summer weather doesn't allow :( awesome place for ig worthy photos!
Highly recommend a visit,"It is worth spending a few hours here meandering the small streets, and you get great views of Seoul in some spots. There are a few houses that are open to visitors, and there are interesting small shops running through the main commercial street."
Interesting. Well Kept. Quite crowded.,"This place is known for its traditional housing images of Korea. It is interesting to see and walk around because cars hardly go through there. The downside is all the tourists are also there like tour groups, families, friends, and couples all walking throughout. So that means getting a shot of an entire empty street is not easy especially if you want the best views. It's a quiet area and there are no shopping stores within so its not like modern areas taken over by all the lighting and music."
Pleasant but overrated IMHO,"Strolled around here, and yes the houses are beautiful, the narrow streets are cute and the craftsmen are nice, bit all in all my opinion was that it was overrated. Of course, this is not 'how people used to live in the old days' (fortunately): this is an idealized one-dimensional (and yes, very cute) view of the past, in ultra clean, perfectly restored Hanok houses loaded with gift shops (which says enough... :-))."
Traditional and vintage,"the best moment to visit this place with hanbok experience. you can rent it out for 2 hours or more for around 15,000 won. There are alot rental shop surrounding this area"
Adorable,Such an adorable neighborhood - charming with no commercial chain stores and love the local independent boutique business mixed with neighborhood charm. Actually shopped much more in this neighborhood than others too. 
Checking the place,This place is the traditional village for locals. So many shops and restaurants along the way. It was very hot when we went there but we enjoyed it taking a picture and trying the little shops. Here you can feel how to become locals like the one you see in Korean drama. Just be careful because cars and motorbikes passes here and they drive crazy.
Early walk ,Started an early walk to Bukchon. Don't expect to see anything much as most places are close before 9am. Nevertheless a good walk without the normal crowd when you are early . Some cafes are already open at 9am
Old Korean Houses,Take your time and watch these beautiful houses very carefully.Most of them are really very beautiful.
Old houses not that impressive,It is not strictly a village. more like few Streets off a main road. Probably will need to ask someone to locate it.We visited this on a rainy day. Got down at anguk station took exit 2. The village is supposed to be on the left about 500 meters away. However we could not find it so ask for a Korean couple who pointed across the road. We still could not see it and we were lost. A middle aged Korean lady was walking towards the opposite direction from us heard our conversation with the couple. She accompanied us and showed us the nicest part of the village. For this she had to walk in opposite direction for more than 1 km as well as had to get wet in the drizzle.I suggest if you are going there get a map of the village from one of the information centers around there.
cultural,"bukchon hanok village is the place to take photos and soak in the cultural atmosphere of South Korea. its unlike the hustle and bustle of the city or myeongdong but very quaint and peaceful. be careful not to disturb the residents who are still living there, but do say hi to them if you meet them. an absolute visit for cultural and architectural buffs :) "
Traditional Korean Village,"Feel the place, live like local. after going to Gyeongbokgung Palace, I plan to go to this place, walking around 20 mins then you can taking a deep breath and see the surrounding area, just imagine you live in Bukchon, feel so happy to get here :)"
Wearing Hanbok and Enjoy the ancient atmosphere,One of the must have places when traveling in Seoul. Make sure you have hired Hanbok to take great pictures
Not worth the time,"As a tourist looking for interesting places to visit, this area seems to be just old houses and narrow streets. "
A walk around Hanok village,A nice place to visit & do try the pumpkin toffee if you can from the old man selling it from a bicycle. The toffee is really delicious. You can only get it here!
Nice stroll,"The scenery is nice, and it's definitely quite hilly so be sure to put on some good shoes to prepare for the walk!You can rent Hanboks from many places around (I didn't do it; but it seems to be a touristy thing to do so that you can catch nice photos)"
More fun to explore without a map,"Bukchon is a fun area to walk around in. There's a lot of cute stores and restaurants along the main streets, but it's also fun to explore some of the more residential streets further north/uphill. There are some great views and lots of picturesque traditional homes. I recommend ditching the maps (resistance is futile) and not worry about getting a little lost."
a respite right smack in the middle of a metropolitan,"go early. very very early. things may not be open yet, but you can get your drinks/meals/souvenir somewhere else. it's a lovely place to walk around wherever your feet takes you, take in the atmosphere. by 9.30 the area will be buzzing with loud tourists taking selfies although there are many signs to warn people to be quiet because real people still live in the area. be considerate. it will be great of you can stay at one of the hanok so you can be there before/after the horde. "
Visit in early evening,"I was visiting Seoul on business and wanted to experience some traditional culture- not easy when you are working all day. My colleague and I took a taxi to visit Bukchon village around 6:30 pm. At this time of day it was quiet and calm. We encountered very few other visitors. We could leisurely explore the beautiful homes and quaint walking streets. The air was cool and breezy- so refreshing after a hot day of trains and taxis. The only downside was that most stores were already closed. At this time, you need just 1/2 hour to 45 mins to explore this area which makes it possible to do at the end of the work day. Then you can easily walk 15 mins. to Insedong for dinner. "
Love it!,"If you are interested in seeing a traditional Korean house, so this is the right place to come. Bukchon Hanok Village is the neighborhood area with traditional house. There are also have coffee shop, boutiques and many more shops inside this area. Worth it. I suggest you go to every 8 spots to take a amazing pictures."
Nice village,"It's a quaint little area with streets lined with houses from the olden days. We saw many people in Hanbok and decided to try. Inexpensive, starting from 10,000 Krw an hour plus optional add ons. As the streets were lined with Hanoks (traditional houses), the walk in Hanbok was made even more memorable. "
Fantastic,If you are interested in historical architecture this is the place to go to.A large area of traditional Korean housing and buildings. Most are occupied so there are only a few that you can enter and they are either retail outlets or in one case a small museum. If you can go inside do so as it gives you a much better feel of the layout of these unique buildings.Gave us a great feel of Korea
Disappointing ,"I was quite disappointed with this place ... it's nothing more than just visiting rows of homes built centuries & decades ago. I was expecting the place to offer greater authenticity, culture & history ... but instead there are modern shops, cafes and private homes with 'Silence please' notices on their closed doors (obviously constant flow of tourists is not quite welcome here). I didn't even get chance to see the inside of a home in this so-called village. Be prepared for the uphill (literally... some of the roads are almost like 45 degrees!) and downhill climb ... so you'll need strong leg muscles and good walking shoes ... no heels! And certainly not for the elderly. Personally I'll advise my friends to give this place a miss ... it's really nothing to shout about. "
Traditional Homes and Great Views,"If you're interested in seeing some traditional homes, this is your spot. Lots of tourists line the streets, so getting an early start definitely works to your advantage. Since it's in one of the hilly areas of the city, you can walk up to the top and see all the traditional roofs surrounded by more modern buildings surrounded by mountains. It's quiet and beautiful and harbors lots of cute boutiques, mini museums/galleries, and food spots along the way."
walking along traditional Korean houses while looking over the modern city of Seoul,"Gyeongbok palace & SamCheongDong & Bukchon Han-ok village are close enough to walk around. Looking around Gyeongbok palace, having lunch or dinner in SamCheongDong and then walking along Bukchon han-ok, it is more like a timeslip, experience tradition and modernity at the same time."
A Feast for your Eyes,"A shop owner where we had just bought some Korean tea highly recommended we come check out this area. Not sure why, we began our hike, I mean exactly that, a hike, because of the steep grade the streets are on. It didn't take long for us to see why it was essential we come see this place. Right next to busy, loud, modern downtown Seoul, you can find this magnificent old town where things appear to not have changed much for centuries. What beautiful homes, this is truly an architectural jewel in the middle of Seoul. Ladies, don't wear high heels! Wear comfortable shoes and take a jacket. Even it it's a warm day, it can get very windy and chilly once you reach the top. This is not appropriate for parents pushing strollers! We loved all the narrow alleys, the old homes that still look today as they did hundreds of years ago. It's wonderful to see how the locals take such excellent care of this old neighborhood. Just lovely! Take lots of photos, if the crowds let you. That was the only negative part of the time we spent here. It's so crowded at times, sometimes you have to wait long periods of time to find an alley or a façade with no crowds to take a decent photo. Enjoy your time here. It really is a must see! Pay attention to details in the craftsmanship of the structures, the wood carvings, the designs, everything! Absolutely stunning!"
Dress UP!,Our two kids dressed in traditional korean clothes and walked through this beautiful village. Certainly a highlight of our holiday.
Old city,"This is amazing place to discover while walking along the small streets, it is in the area of Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changdeokgung Palace, if you like to spend a night there you need to stay in guest house."
A must go in Seoul,"If you have 2 or more days in Seoul, you should include this place in your list. There you would find a village of beautiful houses with unique korean style structure. These houses are well kept and maintained. You would also find a number of locations for taking good photos and so be prepared to allow about 3 hours there. As the place is still resided by local residence, visitors are advised to keep quiet when touring around the area. "
Historical charm,"It is well worth a wander through this historical residential neighbourhood containing over 900 traditional Korean houses or hanoks. The narrow streets meander through the relatively confined area and contain many small artist and artisan studios, the odd traditional tea houses and a range of curio shops. There is very little traffic so it is easy to lose yourself in the exploration."
Nice to stroll around away from the busy center,We stayed in a Hanok for 2 nights in the Bukchon village. When you visit Seoul I would really advice to stroll around in the Bukchon village. It's great to leave all the high buildings and the busy live behind and walk between the traditional houses and visit some shops. And when you stay some nights I would also recommend to sleep in a Hanok and experience the traditional live over there including the great Korean breakfast (like we had in the excellent Cheong Yeon Jae Hanok Hotel).
brought old memories,"It took me back -- way way back to my childhood. I was very happy to see that the city tried to save the neighborhood. Maybe because the weather was too hot, i didn't enjoy it as much as i would have. There were some charming tea cafes which would have been good stops if i had more time. "
Peaceful and Beautiful Hanok Village,We walked here with our son who lives in Seoul. We enjoyed a very quiet and peaceful view of traditional Seoul culture. The streets are steep so be careful if you have problems walking.
A piece of the past,Bukchon Hanok Village is a great place to visit to see when\\at Korean looked like in the past. The homes are beautiful and well kept. It's important to be mindful of the fact that people actually live in these homes. Wear comfortable shoes because it mostly narrow walkways that go up and downhill. Expect to see lots of people taking photos is tradition korean outfits. 
"Commercialised, quite boring","It's still a housing estate so you shouldn't be making a lot.of noise there. The houses are quite pretty coz of their roofs. If you wanna see prettier and much more bukchon houses, go to jeonju, outside of seoul , 3 hr bus ride.If you wanna see even older houses, travel back.in time, visit the Korean folk village at suwon. traditional Performances included. About 2.5 hrs away from seoul by metro. However, it's just a remake of a village not an actual one"
Outstanding architecture and the traditional beauty,"I had chance to stay the night at Bukchon Hanok village and was a bit worried about how to find the place. However, I used the Airvan Service which brings me to the destination from ICN and that just shorten my travel time. The neighborhood is really cute and beautiful with traditional architectures, Hanoks. As it is known for it's traditional houses, there were so many people walking around even in Hanbok. I loved how the traditional and modern buildings coexist together in this busy city. The Hanoks made me calm and everything looked so peaceful."
Wear good shoes!!,"Hilly walk with sweeping views and small workshop places where you could take a class or just watch others crafting away. Cool to see so many dressed up in hanbok (traditional clothing). Find the library and take a break there, too. "
Must visit,"There are not many culturally unique place in Seoul to visit, beside the palace, this hilly Korean tradition houses are unique and great to roam around in Korean traditional costumes (recommend to rent one, the price is reasonable). It's not very close to the station,need to walk for a while, do take exit 2, if you come by metro Angu station. Recommend to stop by tourist office to get a map."
Beautiful traditional houses,This village provided a wonderful insight of traditional Korean life. They were very clean and the local people were friendly. It was really nice to see beautiful traditional clothes being worn.
Step back in time ,While the houses here are the historic ones they are actually real houses that people live in so be wary not to make too much noise. Worth a visit if you are visiting the nearby palaces (can walk by foot). Check out the information centre to hear about the free house museum that's worth going to. 
A quaint old town with traditional korean homes,Good place for a 3hr tour. Most residents are already used to the invading eyes of tourists peeking into their homes. Uphill/downhill narrow streets . Outside of the hanok village are many good restaurants including touristy ones. A great place is the steak house just at the road junction at the entrance to the billage. You can't miss it.
bukchon hanok village,one of the old quarters of seoul where the traditional houses have been renovated. it gives a good view on the living conditions of wealthy Korean families in oldersn times.
back in time,"There is no bad time to come here. Day, evening, fall, spring, it has little treats around every corner and everyone seems to enjoy being there or discovering it."
Avoid in the hottest month,Nice place to explore but August is the hottest month so this not an ideal attraction. Will be better for other months and Seasons.
Back into old Seoul,"This is a must see if you want to see the traditional Korean house. Beautiful area where you can enjoy shopping, unique shops and food. A nice way to spend half a day enjoying the views and food."
Back in Time,"Bukchon Hanok Village take you back in time to olden Korean houses and structure. Very picturesque and quaint to walk along the area to see the houses, street lamps and roofs. What is incredible is that people actually live here. Make an effort to visit as you will not be disappointed."
Pretty place for photo-taking,"It's quite a hike to get to Bukchon Hanok Village but the view is worth it! Look out for the guides in red shirts to guide you to the village.The traditional houses are stunning and the neighbourhood is peaceful. If you have some time, pop by into some of the stores there.Good to grab a banana milk and some snacks while on the way:)"
Beautiful traditional area,I love this area very much. It is very traditional. Just walk around and you can imagine yourself dressing in Hanbok! This area is also a walkable distance to Samchongdong which is full of shops and cafes. It is also very nice to walk in fall. 
South Korea's Best Kept Secret,"Seoul's largest concentration of Hanok, traditional Korean homes that dates back to the Josean Dynasty. It's a busy tourist area, but it's still a pleasure to get lost in the streets here admiring the patterned walls and tiles roofs contrasting with the modern city in the distance. Many operate as cultural centers, guesthouses, restaurants and tea houses providing visitors an opportunity to experience, learn and immerse in traditional Korean culture. Anguk Station Subway Line 3 Exit 1/2. "
Bad experience in on of restaurant ,"Just ordinary view. I suggest you to find a restaurant with a fixed price that show in front of it, or you should pay the expensive price like we did."
Must do,We stumbled upon this street while walking around the palace - it's a must-do. It's super cute and just wander around the streets and stop for a bite or a fun drink. 
Nice to walk through but admittedly quite boring,"This area is often described as a 'living-museum' but that oversells it. The walls in the area are plastered with posters advising where you cannot take pictures and constantly telling you to stay quiet. I understand this is due to the fact that people live and work here but then there are stalls exploiting the tourists who are playing music out loud to attract people. A strange place which, though not exceptionally busy, still a tourist spot through and through. Not that much to do or experience."
Nice Korean traditional village,"We walked throughout the village. There are many shops selling different items, from clothes, shoes, art items, etc... loads of restaurants and cafes too. Different from city shopping. "
"A bit of ""old"" Seoul still in place.","I like this old style village in Seoul. It is nice to have a look there, get a drink in one of the cafés and take some photographs."
Traditional and Modern Korean architecture side by side,"Here one can see the traditional and modern korean structures side by side, Narrow allies, well maintained traditional building structures.it's an amazing view."
A pearl in the middle of the city,Beautiful old and small houses. Just take a slow stroll between the houses. Many tourists though. Since there are locals living there you have to be quiet to show respect for them. Unfortunately some people dont seem to understand that.
Korean village,I love this place. I visited Bukchon Hanok Village right after GyeongBokGong in my rented hanbok. I felt a different vibe walking around in my hanbok. Should give it a try ( you wont be the only person walking in a hanbok).
Traditional korean houses,"We originally planned to visit this village around 2pm after our gyeongbokgong palace visit and ginseng chicken lunch.However, the scotching hot sun is really unbearable for us and we decided to visit here around 5pm. Houses are beautiful and built on inclined pavement. There are lots of signs to remind visitors to lower their volume. Quite a unique experience despite the hot sun."
A piece of Korean village in Seoul,We had a nice and peaceful walk through the streets of Bukchon. There are some nice views of the city from the hill.
Very interesting ancient neighbourhood,"You can take the subway line 3 (orange) and get out from Anguk station at exit 2 or 6. Go north towards Buchon-ro. There at interesting quaint shops along the way, and some Sundubu restaurants the local visits. Walk about 100 M or so to the intersection and Bukchon village is a little further up to the north. Turn right 100M to Changdeokgung Palace or turn left a 120 M to Gyeongbokgung Palace. You will find plenty of Hanbok rental stores and I recommend 3355 Hanbok rental for their cleanliness and service. Do be very quiet in consideration of residents still living in the ancient houses. The structures, doors, roofs, walls are very interesting and make good photo back drops. It is not necessary to go where all the bus loads of tourists are led to. There are some more further up and opposite the road. "
Nice,Nice to see but still missing to renovate some of the houses there and it will be perfect. Nice places to see and drink and eat. Very charming anyway. Nice pictures to do but recommend it on the night mainly. Thanks 
Beautiful Korean Traditional Homes,"Loved my visit to the Bukchon Hanok Village! This is the only place in Seoul which still has traditional korean hanoks around. It's amazing to see traditional houses right in the middle of the otherwise cosmopolitan city, almost like taking a time machine back to Joseon era!"
Traditional Korean houses,"If you never been to a traditional Korean ""village"" this is a place for you! The village is not far, and when you walk in you feel this is very different from the city - you can see the old architecture, building, culture. If you love those old style building, don't miss this place."
Better visited when the Bukchon Visitor Info Center is open,"Strolling through the neighborhood on a Sunday, when lots of Koreans are in traditional dress, is fun. But having informaiton about what to see, provided by the Visitor Center, would make the visit even better. So don't plan to go on Sunday!"
Good for a meander,Good for a quick visit and to see genuine hanok houses that people still live in. Close to palaces so can wander through the village on the way to or from them.
Didn't find the exact place,We use Google maps to find this place.We walk along the road of some of Hanok village but some of it has been modernise.Definitely will go again to find the right place.
Beautiful area,The tourist infomation centres can provide maps to the more photogenic parts of the village. We also noticed map stands placed at various locations within the village.The tourists were out in force on the most photogenic street. Nearly every door and every wall had a sign reminding people to be quiet as these beautiful old homes are lived in by normal people. I don't think the signs were working.It was quite obvious that the hanbok rental places were doing very well in this area as we were vastly outnumbered by the hanbok wearers.Be prepared for some hill climbing.
Nice for a little walk,This area is a great contrast to the modern city. Lovely old characteristic houses. Good for a nice walk around.
Travel in time!,"A place where you can find Korean traditional houses. Felt I was transported to a different time. Considering how ultramodern Seoul can be,really nice to find a place like this! A must visit for tourist. An Iconic village! Wearing our rented hanboks, me and my daughter enjoyed roaming around this beautiful village. We felt like a local!"
Nice Hanok Village Right In Seoul,"If you don't get the chance to get outside of Seoul during your trip and want to see a Hanok village, this is a good option. Our Korean friend was super excited that we were finally visiting Korea and wanted to show us around, Bukchon was one of the places he brought us one afternoon. It's a very pretty, quiet place to walk around for a couple hours, and there are some nice little shops there, especially if you are interested in Hanbok clothing or crafts. If you have the opportunity to see other Hanok villages on your visit to Korea, you probably don't ""need"" to visit this one, but if you have an interest in them, this is a very nice place to walk around and take some photos."
Traditional buildings,"Probably worth visiting once but not as good as the traditional streets in Kyoto, Japan. Many resturants. "
Okay,It's ok. A bit overrated I think. Wear the tradition clothing will make the experience a lot nicer! It's a bit hard to find if no maps or wifi... but sure u can experience the local atmosphere herex 
One of the quietest places in Seoul,"We stayed in a Hanok in this ""traditional"" neighborhood. It is also a bit touristy but in a relaxed way. It is a sort of open air museum. A lot of houses are restaurants, shops or hotels now but it is one of the best places to relax and escape the frenetic pace of the city."
Beautiful little village,Need to climb small hidden stairs. Beautiful quite little traditional village. Must try their tea houses. 
Our walking tour in Bukchon Hanok Village,We went to this village on 29 June. It was awesome. Lots of cosmatic shops. We also had a local lunch at a Hanok Resturaunt. the food was delicious. Within Seoul it gives a flavour of village life. lot of school children were running here and there.Full of vibrant life!!
Nice place to visit,"Bukchon Hanok Village is a Korean traditional village in Seoul with a long history located between Gyeongbok Palace, Changdeok Palace and Jongmyo Royal Shrine. Just go to Anguk Station and. Just drop at Anguk Station exit 2 and walk straight. However, if you like you can visit first Gyeongbok Palace and after walk to Bukchon, at Bukchon you can also find the best Korean Ginseng Chicken Soup going to Insadong area. There are so many traditional Korean houses here and if you are a Kdrama fanatic, you can see the house of Lee minho in Personal Taste drama , House #3. Enjoy your visit at Bukchon hanok village."
"Americans visiting Seoul, and staying in a hanok","We are from California and are in a hanok right now! It's so beautiful inside. If you get a chance to rent one, do it! We have had lots of people knock on our door, asking to look inside. I don't mind though."
Overrated but good,I found this overrated but good nonetheless as it gives you a glimpse of actual Korean residence without the trappings of highrise living. When visiting this place be mindful though that it still a residential area so keep your voices down. Just take good photos. 
An over-valued scenic spot in Seoul!!,"Be smart to avoid becoming one of the non-sensible tourists who just follow what most others did....unless you are a westerner who has never visited the east and seen nothing about Chinese/Asian-styled temples or architecture online.There you could only see the walls mainly, and some roof, that was all. Not a big area, just two to three small streets. It was rather ridiculous (for me at least) that so many tourists went there and caused disturbances to the living residence, thus there were many notices reminding tourists to keep quiet now. While there was not much to see or not easy to get any surprise, one worthwhile thing you can do is perhaps renting a set of ""Hanbok"" (Korean traditional clothing) at a cheap price of W10,000 and then take photos. But better do this in the early morning, or more and more tourists will be there."
nothing much,"tough way to walk uphill in the hot summer weather.most of the houses are closed, cannot view the interior.only can take photos from outside. after a while, all of them look the same."
lovely traditional houses,"To find this easily, go to the number 8 must visit spots in Bukchon which is available in all maps. The place is hilly but worth it. There are many tourist here but you can still capture the hanoks. If you are into kdrama (personal taste) this is not where the filming was shot. It is on the other street."
Korean traditional houses,"This community is on the slope of a foothill. We followed the google map and got off the bus at wrong stop and walk back to the village. The sign was hard to understand the best way to visit the village. Confused us a lot! The authority should improve the sign to make it easier to understand and please...in English! Almost everything here cost you money, take a look at the signs carefully..."
"Beautiful part of the city, a pleasure to walk through","I loved strolling through the narrow and quiet streets of this village. Traditional Korean houses, beautiful gates, a lot of green! Here and there you'd stumble across small artsy shops selling anything from souvenirs to leather shoes and ceramic works of art. You feel quite removed from the city in this area and you feel compelled to check out every single store that you encounter as they are all so different and creative. There are also small old style restaurants and modern cafes so one could lose a couple of hours walking around.This part of Seoul was my absolute favourite."
"Amazing historical place, beautiful and quite","I went there after lunch and had a pleasant walking for the whole afternoon. There is a lot to see. Better get the village map in advance, becuase the village have two parts that are separated by a main road, and one side is much larger. Don't miss any part of it !"
Traditional Korea,"First of all - it's residential area, so don't talk loud and behave nicely :)Second of all - try going there in the early morning if you want to avoid crowds and take pictures of empty streets. Otherwise wait and queue.Third - if you come early, be prepared that most of cafes and shops open there around 10 to 11 am.Overall definitely worth a visit if you want to see traditional culture and buildings."
Very cute area,Beautiful traditional houses and quaint little streets with nice views. Shops and restaurants too. Had great Korean BBQ lunch!!
Please observe good manners!,"If you want to see traditional Korean houses in Seoul, the best place may be Bukchon Hanok Village. But, someone live here. You need to watch your manners in public places. "
Old Seoul city,"Most of the houses in this village had been renovated but they maintain the outside facade, so it is very interesting to walk around the narrow alleys in this village. Each house has different main gate design."
A walk through time ,This would a must visit destination for those Korean drama lovers. To avoid crowds go in the morning as the tour groups tend to arrive by 11am. Please avoid making too much noises as these houses are still resided by residents. The top of the hill has a great view of the city. Also enjoyed traditional Woojeon tea at a traditional tea house. A street vendor also sold amazing fresh fried dumplings between Anguk station and Bukchon Hanok Village. 
Such a nice neighbourhood in Seoul centre,So nice to walk in this neighbourhood with those old traditional houses. Many people do hire the traditional korean outfit to visit this area. A pleasure for the eyes to see those coloured Hanbok in the streets.
Quaint and beautiful,"These are essentially people's homes. Such beautiful traditional buildings and quaint narrow streets...but imagine having your neighborhood so overrun by noisy tourists that you need to stick up ""Silence Please"" signs on your doors. Sad...."
Combine this visit with Gyeungbokgoong Palace and rent a hanbok for A$20,"Tip #1: Download maps.me app as you will need this to walk around BukchonTip #2: Download Seoul subway and bus app so you can see which transportation can get you thereTip #3: I took taxi from Seoul City Hall for 10 000Won (A$11)Tip #4: The little streets have no semblance of logic. Road 1 is cut off and suddenly appears somewhere else. Maps.me could help but you just have to mosey around a bitTip #5: Great cafes and places to sit and watch the world go by hereIf you go to Hanbok-Nam, for A$20 you can rent a hanbok and walk to the palace and take some cheesy fotos. This is good fun. Or wear it and have some selfies taken in this quaint ballina which hides cafes, restaurants. Its is about 10 min walk to the palace. Go early so you don't get the smattering of tourists, say 11?"
"Heritage, Cultural and more","Love the little allies here surrounded by Hanok - traditional Korean houses, one can find a few DIY jewellery shops as well as little cafes and Korean eateries. Try to be there around noon time as most shops open after 11. If your schedule allows, book for a Hanok Stay, well worth it!"
Traditional small village,Very cute place with many old traditional small houses and narrow streets. Has many cute small cafes and souvenirs shops. And have many hanbok rentals
Pretty village nice coffee,Went here after a visit to Namsan tower. A lot of hype from people about taking selfies in a hanbok. The site offers a glimpse of the past with a lot of alleways to get lost in. Enjoyed the walk then found some pretty good shops with a some good deals. There are a few boutique places to visit but the coffee shop with its cold brew equipment was great. Try their homemade cookies for snack whike walking around. Then going further down a few good souvenir shops. When tired there are a lot of taxis to hail and taxus in korea is cheap although they can be a bit of a maniac.
good walk through,We walked through here with a tour guide so it wasn't so confusing which might have made the trip nicer than it could've have been if we were on our own but we had a great time in the Hanok Village. The homes were beautiful and we got many beautiful photos. We even made a stop where we went inside one of the homes that was on exhibit to show tourists the size of the inside of the houses l (which are tiny by the way-I don't know how people live like that). It was a very lovely walk through and lasted about an hour. However it was a bit of a walk to get to the village so if you are not up to a 20 minute walk or so with an incline I would not recommend the Village to you. 
Nice area to take a walk and pictures. ,Bukchon has really old traditional houses that people live in actually. On the hill you can see Seoul N tower. A bit hilly but nice to take a walk 
Lovely visit,A lovely place to visit in the city. Nice area and walking routes through a residential area featuring the old style of houses. Great photo opportunities and views across the city. The quaint shops lining the streets toward the station were interesting and nice to pop in. Nice away from the real hustle and bustle of the city.The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I currently live in Jeonju and we have the infamous hanok village. 
Interesting,"We walked through the village after having visited the palace - a 10-15 minute walk.The village was very interesting although we weren't fortunate enough to get into one of the houses.Lots of souvenir and finger food opportunity as you stroll the streets.Some great views at the top of the hill, the village houses with the city views in the background.Worth a visit."
A Must!,"Such an adorable little village and a must to visit during your trip to Korea. If you can, book an Air BnB and stay in a hanok for an amazing experience."
Nice and peacefull place,"This was very nice rest for me in this place. A lot of interesting architecture buildings, beautifull park with a lot of flowers and green leaves. Nice introduction of Korean history for me and nice rest in this rush city. I recomand this place for visit and spent nice time."
Cultural houses with modern shops ,"The best thing about it was the traditional Korean houses which the people actually lived in. Very instagram-able and photogenic place. The modern shops were nice to know, but not so much different with others in the city. "
A few old houses on the hill - reminder of days gone by,"Small ""village"" which is basically a few old houses (representative of traditional Korean houses) on the hill overlooking the city that has not yet been demolised to make way for tall towers. If you really don't have much time in Seoul, can skip this. "
Cute area to walk around,"Seoul is obviously a very metropolitan city, so it was nice to walk around an area with very traditional Korean houses for a little bit. We should have looked up beforehand because we ended up joining the ""trail"" halfway through. But you get the gist of it pretty quickly. The village is now dotted with cafes and artisan shops that are worth stopping by if you're in the market for some souvenirs. If you want a nice break with a view, go to the cafes at the top of the hill."
Interesting place! ,"This place is near by Palace (around 20' walking). The area is totally different from the Myongdong. You can discover the houses in traditional styles stand beside the ones in modern but the general is so harmonies. At the end of the Main Street, you can see an university which is built with the style of Europe. "
Tourist spot,"Bukchon hanok village very near to Gyeongbokgung palace.From main gate of Gyeongbokgung palace we just follow the street and then turn left after that just go straight untill you find the street name at right side.( you need to cross the street).Btw,its better you if you get a map from tourist information office.so many people wearing hanbok around this place.Great experience.In small street got many mini shops which sell cloth and light food."
Modern clean and lacking character ,It was awkward wandering living neighbourhood which was clean and well kept. The building design are interesting to look at. There are none to go in and I spotted to drink stops on the outskirts.Worth a look if you have time but Seoul has so much more to offer.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful 
Beautiful traditional houses,"Road abit steep at some point, would required to walk up slope.Do wear comfortable shoes.Beautiful place for photo taking."
Remember you are in peoples backyards!,"A nice enough place but nothing too impressive about this area. You see some nice architecture and some nice houses a lot of which have been modernized but have been kept in the same Hanok style. This is an original area. Just remember before you go mooching around that these are peoples homes and some have very big dogs so beware! About 20 min leisurely walk from the metro, shops and restaurants along the way. If you want to hire traditional Hanbok dress for male and female there are plenty of shops around the area to help you walk around like you were back in the day. You will see lots of people walking around in the traditional dress with the vibrant colours."
Touristy but still worth a visit,"My family took subway (Dark Blue line1) from Seoul station for 3 stops to Jongno 3(sam)-ga and transfer to Orange line 3 for 1 stop to Anguk station. Exit 3 and walk towards Constitution Court of Korea, and carry on walking for another 5 mins up slope and you should be able to see the entrance to the conservatory Bukchon Village. For those who has plans to try out their traditional hanbok costumes, one can try renting them in Anguk station or shops around the station. One advise is to go early so one would have the widest choices of prettiest and best hanbok available to choose from. Cost wise is normally 10,000won for 2 hrs, 20,000 for 4hrs. "
A village frozen in time...,"It's amazing that this traditional Korean village even existed in the middle of the modern metropolitan city of Seoul. Start at the Bukchon tourist information centre, get hold of a walking map and follow the recommended walking paths, which will lead you through numerous residential alleys - uphill, downhill and through stone stairways. You will be feted with picturesque views all round, from prettily preserved traditional houses to scenic views of the surrounding hills and palace rooftops. Oh, since this is an actual residential area, be respectful to the residents living there."
Very pretty,"We didn't find it at first, but when we did the picturesque village was worth a look. Be awarw that there are quite a lot of tourists (like yourself) that are in the way of that perfect picture. "
Korea traditional villages ,Very unique place. This is the traditional place to take picture. You can find many place to rent a traditional hanbok
Beautiful Village,"Enjoyed the walk up the hill and taking photos of the beautiful houses along the way. When you get to the top of the hill, you can see a great view of the city all the way across the N Tower. Great place to just take a walk and enjoy the neighborhood."
Picturesque historic neighborhood,"We enjoyed taking the walking tour through Bukchon. The walk goes up into the hills a bit and can be steep in some places (kind of uncomfortable in hot weather!) but you will wander along some beautiful and photogenic streets and see gorgeous hanoks. The lower level areas are more commercial with restaurants, coffee houses, ice cream places and nice shops."
explore Korean culture in the center of the city,"Warning: Bad English! Bukchon is the perfect area to explore real Korean culture in the city center. Though this area is very touristy but still a quick way to observe the real Korean while enjoying shopping and eating.Go to the tourist information center and grab a map to guide your way through. Without the map it is pretty easy to get lost as all houses seem to look the same! There are 8 photo spots where you can get the best photos of Bukchon, especially number 5 and 6 on Gahoe-dong alley are the most popular spots (and of course most crowded). Actually number 5 and 6 are the same spot but one is from the upward view and the others is downward. Bukchon is surrounded by souvenir shops, cloth shops, restaurants, tea houses and hanbok (traditional Korean dress) rental shops. In every minute I saw women in hanbok walking around and take selfies, that's cute. Be quiet and respect the locals since this is a residential area. There are signs telling you not to disturb the locals. Just a few hundred meters north of Bukchon, it's Samcheongdong-gil road where there are heaps of nice restaurants. And if you walk further, you can find Gyeongbokgung palace, Changdeokgung palace and Jongmyo shrine. So come in the early morning to complete this walking route. It's an easy and joyful whole day trip. I visited Bukchon in mid April and I saw some cherry blossoms. I think if you wish to see them in full bloom, you need to come in early April."
Climb and walk and climb and walk,"Road very steep at some point, gorgeous architecture. Lots of tourist, beautiful scenery at the higher point. A must visit when in Korea. "
Traditional village!,It's an old traditional Korean village. Some/most parts are private. It's a long stretch and will take an hour walk to finish. A lot of stores you can see along the way too. Wear comfy shoes and clothes! 
Stepping into a quieter time,"This area of traditional hanok houses - and new ones being built - is full of arty crafty workshops and tourists dressed in hanbok having their photos taken. It's a pleasure to wander round the lanes imagining a less frantic way of life, if you manage to go at a quieter time. You can get a map at the visitor centre showing where a lot of the workshops are. We visited a gold leaf workshop where a lovely man took great pleasure in explaining his work and showing examples to us with no expectation of selling anything. There are also quite a few residential buildings with notices outside telling you to be quiet - not much chance of that!"
A Trip to Old Seoul,"Picturesque, charming, hilly, rustic, stone and earth dwellings. A look backward to the traditional homes of the elite. Also, museums, galleries, cafes, traditional Hanok houses. If you make it to the top, I have been told, the view is spectacular. My bum knee kept me from making it that far. Sigh."
Must See Korean Traditional Houses!,"Hanok is a term used to describe Korean traditional houses. Beautiful place to stroll around. Authentic Korean houses with a lot of nice souvenir shops, coffee shops and also restaurants. You can rent hanbok here and you can also enter some of the houses for free."
Good place to be if you have some time,"I got time to visit this place. It is a culture hub and intend to share it with those that visit the place. While all the houses are privately owned, some owners opens the place and share the unique Korean culture, art and crafts. There are also several homestays for tourist that wanted more in-depth look at Korean culture."
Free walking tour of Bukchon village,I went on a free walking trip to Bukchon village on June 18 . It was luckily a small group of 6 and we had 2 guides Ms Jua and Ms Diam. The tour started on time at second exit of Anguk Station and lasted about 2 hours. It was informative and interesting and very enjoyable if it was on very sunny hot Seoul day. 
"Must see, but does not require much time","Really cool, small, historic houses in the middle of modern Seoul. Definitely worth stopping by for some great pics."
Better to visit in cold weather,"I'm a big fan of Korean dramas, so this place is gold for me. My friends and I found joy in just walking around in very cold weather (less than 10 degree Celsius), we stopped for photos every 5 minutes because every corner of this village look great in photos."
Neat place to see,Neat little village to see and experience. Very nice and clean place. Quietly located on the East coast of South Korea. 
History!,This area is beautiful. Seoul is one of the most interesting cities because of its ability to mix new and old architecture. The village is very fun to have a walk in.
Old school Korea,"We had a fairly difficult time finding the actual village proper, because after getting off at the right subway, you need to walk a long, long way to see any tourists. We definitely had different expectations upon arriving. What we assumed was a museum-like town turned out to be an actual residential district! People actually live in this part of town, and what makes it a ""hanok"" village is that all of their homes resemble the old ""hanok"" of Korea's past dynasties. Unless you get a walking tour with a group, you won't have any commentary at all. But if you go here yourself, you can find a hanbok rental store and wear their traditional costume around the village for 1-2 hours! I think it's a great deal and is worth the Won because the experience of wearing their costume freely around an old-school style village is priceless. It's like you're living the life of a traditional Korean princess! Besides that, there isn't much to see or do. "
Bukchon Hanok Village,"This lovely, traditional district is sandwiched between the two main palaces in north Seoul and so makes an excellent place for any visitor to stay. The district is full of good restaurants, interesting workshops, some specialising in silver and ceramics. The old Hanoks.are central to the charm with lots of interesting architectural detail. It is a quiet area and delightful for an evening wander and a delicious meal of Jeju black pork. "
"Interesting enough to see, but not much else.","This is a neighborhood with traditional Korean houses, many of which have been converted to shops and museums when the residents were bothered by the tourists. Strict laws require that the traditional architecture be maintained. Due to the destruction of the Korean war, this area provides an uncommon view into the old style homes of Koreans, and is therefore worth the visit. In our case we included it in a private tour we arranged with Sweetrips, an excellent tour company which is the subject of another review."
pleasant walk,"nice walk around traditional homes - you need to keep quiet because it is a residential area. for an added flavour, rent some traditional clothes to wear on your walk. great photo opportunity if there weren't so many tourists."
Elusive,"We walked the main street as per the map, & although not sure what we were looking for, we didn't find it!! With some help in translating, we asked some police officers, they couldn't tell us where the village was either!It's an older area, & well maintained, although we didn't find anything ""traditional""."
Traditional Korean culture,"You are surrounded by houses built in the traditional Korean style. There are places where you can rent Hanbok, traditional dress, and it's lovely to see people walking around wearing them, taking photos! We found a nice tea house where you can enjoy some authentic Korean tea and snacks!! A place you must visit!!"
"Walk among Hanoks, look around galleries","One of my American friend wanted to visit Bukchon, so we took a trip here on sunny sunday. It was a good choice. If you visit Bukchon, walk along ""북촌팔경(8 views of Bukchon) and see the city's skyline from the top of hill. There are signs pointing it everywhere, so it's easy to find the way. Also, there are plenty of free galleries around this village. Their sizes are humble but pieces in them are quite good and modern. Most of the exhibitions are held in Hanok houses, so you can actually get into the houses to see them. For rooftop view, there's a good spot at Old Bath House building. Now it is changed into eyeglasses shop(""Gentle Monster"") and its rooftop on 3rd floor is opened to public."
Old Korea,"Near by historical museums can be found, lots of shopping, food and you can see also tourist wearing Hanbok; old architecture of their houses can be seen here."
Must See In Seoul,"A great area to visit. Wonderful traditional Korean homes with very interesting architecture. A nice walk from the city if you leave somewhere around City Hall, Soedemum or Myeongdong areas. A nice choice of restaurants and specialty stores in the Bukchon area."
Quaint village next to large palace,This village makes for an easy duo with the large palace beside it. But please be quiet and courteous to the residents!
Traditional old street,"Nice area for a walk. Hanging around the traditional style house and street is making it really nice.Enjoy the architecture style, the wall, the door. Every step is a bit different.Just get yourself lost in there and don't follow the crowd.There is as well an observatory which is just a 5th floor flat that gives a view over some roof top. "
So many tourists,"Bukchon is a small village which full of ancient architectures. It's not only a tourist spot, local people are truly live inside! So we have to keep our voice down when walking through the village. It was nice visit here. "
Nice to see,"It took a while for me to find this place, because it isn't easy to find. We ended up following a tour group to find it. We walked from the palace to this place, probably 15 minutes walk, but we got lost several times, so it actually took 1 hr. The surrounding area between the palace and this village is very hip, so lots of shopping and eating. The village itself is small, aside from photo-op, not really much to do."
Only a few parts are traditionally a Hanok village,"if you don't have the time , then this place is worth a short visit of about 2 hours . The place is big and you might not see the real Bukchon Hanok village. here is a tip -Get a map from the tourist office at Insadong . They are really helpful and will point out which streets to go to. only a few streets are worth seeing. The rest are just too modern. but if you really have time and want to see a real Hanok village then take a day trip to Yongin , ( south of Seoul) or go to Andong Folk village. They are really two Hanok of differing eras. Yongin is reflective of earlier Joseon whilst Andong Folk village is more a later Joseon. Whilst Bukchon is more like a 20th century version of a Hanok village. Korean drams use Yongin and Andong as film locations for Saguek dramas.Here is a tip, go to the visitkorea website and join a free walking tour with a guide you will learn so much more of the Bukchon area. Lin Lin"
Awesome!,This village preserves traditional houses and buildings. The design is amazingly beautiful. Wanna come back again someday!
Classic Korean village,Super nice and pretty village. There are still people living here so tourists are told to be quiet at all time. It is better to follow the suggested path to walk so you won't get lost. Worth visiting!
Narrow Streets and Traditional Houses,We took the walk ourselves and in the evening. It was lovely to see the narrow streets and traditional houses with traditional roofs. There were many cultural experience places but were closed because we went in the evening. It's a walk up hill and at one spot we could see all the way to Namsan Tower.
beautiful,"walk around this neighborhood is so great.surrounded by mountain and the house in this neighborhood actually very traditional.and yes people do live here, its not just an attraction of empty traditional house.just take ur time and get lost in this area.wonderful"
A blend of modernity and tradition,"Beautiful neighborhood in the northern part of the city.Surrounded by beautiful mountains, it is peaceful and traditional, but you can still find shoppibg and nice cafe"
Great visit,"Great visit to Bukchon Hanok Village. There two places you can go around. from the National museum, you can cross the road and go straight along the streets. you can wander around the but you need to careful because there are people living there. There are signage that tells you to ""shhhhhhhh"". You can take a pictures here and there and also you can see the view of Seoul from here too.Aside from the architecture, nothing much you can do here. To go there : you need a courage to climb up the stairs. Prepare some water along your way."
Scenic view walk of the old versus new,Take your time to admire the architecture and some home allow you to walk into it to see it. Wear comfortable shoes as it really take time to admire us sering the city skyline. There are foodies and souvenirs. Do not discard waste after eating & drinking it plus no loud voice so as not to disrupt the home owners. Enjoy it with patience. 
Old style neighbourhood still lived in today,"This area of the old style houses is very interesting.It's still lived in so there are the ""Shhhhhh...."" signs which is a nice touch.The small streets & architecture of the old style Hanok Houses is very interesting.Recommended viewing if in Seoul. "
Not Exciting,"I visited other traditional villages in South Korea that were much more interesting. I believe a couple craft shops were open, but aside from architecture, there really wasn't much that interested me."
Bukchon hanok village,One of best... area we visited. We love to go back and stay more time. Great place to see the old house... Great place to take photos. 
Old Seoul,Another place you have to experience -its a total contrast to the modern skyscraper Seoul and thankfully it have not been bulldozed down....
A very interesting place,We visited this village in the morning. It is nestled behind commercial shops and restaurants so we had a hard time looking for it. We saw ancient and traditional houses which were given to the nobility during the past. Hanbok rental are available for authentic feel during those times. I got to wear one. Amazing! 
Traditional housing area,Is good for picture taking. Otherwise nothing special at there.Nearby Gyeongbukgong palace. Beside that there is few souvenir shop around. 
Nice area,"Visit if you like architecture and also buying/looking at handicraft items. A lot of the traditional houses (with proper signage) are actually open for visits (free) and you can pick up a map from these locations that have a route planned out for you. At the end of the route, you will end up along Yulgok-ro 3 gil which is a very trendy and lively street with shops and nice modern/traditional blended houses. This street is connected to Insadong"
Beautiful ,Another great spot in Seoul. Im jealous of the people who get to live here. The architecture is beautiful and there are an infinite amount of spots to take great pictures. There are also plenty of stops to eat and have a beer. Definitely worth a few hours of your time. 
Just some houses ,"Title says it all, this is just a collection of 'traditional' houses. Nothing really special as the houses have a very modern feel about them. Lots of toerists in traditional Korean dress which about sums up the authenticity of this place. Skip."
A urban village with ancient walls,This place is very good is you would like to see how the houses look like in the ancient times. It has the unique looks of the past and closet to Gyeongbokgung Palace. You may want to plan your itinerary to visit this two places together if you are keen on both attractions.
I walked along the past,A place where you can see the distinction of old to modern houses. They preserved the legacy of the past. Enjoy walking and you can feel the tranquility of the village especially If most of the visitors know how to show respect by not too noisy. Most of the houses are privately owned and they need privacy. Visitors should take that into consideration. We should be thankful because they open their village and they allow peoiple to step along their historical place.
Nice to see but no must see,"Currently there are some constructions going on and the whole place feels very touristy. Expensive shops around and a lot of Asian tourists in hanboks trying to take ""traditional"" pictures. Everybody is just pretty much hunting that one picture.I feel sorry for the residents as there are various signs to keep quiet."
Worth to visit this beautiful place when you are in Seoul,"Really amazed of the beautiful Old Korean House and the beautiful cherry blossoms that surrounds the village. It`s very near Myeongdong, and just get off at Chungmuro Station exit 3 then just 2 minutes walking and you will see this beautiful Korean Village. There`s a lot of activities you can try to. I was amazed of the cherry blossoms there."
A Walk To Remember,"This quaint and charming neighborhood situated in the center of Seoul is truly a sight to behold. With 600 years of history, and architecture and culture not found elsewhere in the capital, this is indeed a ""must-see"" on your Korean Itinerary."
Just beautiful ,Please remember these homes are all occupied and it is a residential neighborhood. The homes are just spectacular and the area is wonderful. It's located in between the two palaces so I highly suggest you make a day out of it and visit all three sites. If you're up for some fun rent traditional Korean dress and go to the village and palaces. The outfits are beautiful and the rental places do your head to toe look. There are great local coffee places and we both enjoyed sipping on coffee while admiring the traditional architecture. 
"Nice to say we did it, but....","We went there, but only because every SK guide book we owned told us too! It was beautiful and if you like the historic scene then give it a whirl; I personally found it boring and intrusive to the people that lived in the area. There's not a lot to see or do there; however good shopping, coffee shops etc in the lower levels and Parallel to the Hanoks! Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have made an effort to find it!!"
Heritage walk,this is a must visit place while you are in Seoul.. stacks of korean style home and few shops along the way.. has a view of the neighborhood... rent an hanbok and take a picture of yourself in one of the studios. there were many boutiques where you can pretty stuffs .. 
Great Neighborhood,This is definitely one of the places to visit in Seoul. The traditional Korean houses are a sight to behold. 
A gen,Walking thru the village took us into the past...quite a contrast with the modern buildings in the background. 
Village Charm,"Lovely historic buildings and houses make this an interesting place to visit. I was not able to locate the tourist information office that was marked on my map so I was really unsure of where to start. There are some maps up that show the premier spots. I was a bit concerned for the people who live here as floods of people are loudly trekking through their neighborhood, taking pictures of their property and sometimes even entering their homes as their were many signs up identifying private property. "
Traditional district with old style houses,Lovely place to explore. Old and traditional architecture and a few cool shops located there. Not a place for shopping but gives you an idea on how housing districts were like 50 years ago. 
Worth a visit,You will see how Seoul looked befaore the civil war and can sea the dramatical changes from traditional to modern western city
Always love this place,Always love the houses here. Only setback is there are also many people taking photos of this place. So quite difficult to get a good shot.
Traditional Korean houses which are still in use today..,"This place gives you a good insight into how Korean people lived in the past. Luckily, people still live there today and you will come across a open house for you to explore.You have to remember to be quiet when you are waling around, people still live here and go about their daily lives.Great for photography. So many alleys and streets to explore with some little hidden gems to discover. I think a review is useful to highlight what this place is all about, but I really do not want to spoil it for you. Put this on your list of must see places in Seoul. You will not be disappointed."
Walking around in hanbok!,"I rented a hanbok from a shop in the village and walked around. The hanbok rental shop opens at 10am and it costs 15,000 KRW for a 2 hour rental! It was a very fun experience and I took many photos at the hanok village. There is a museum there where you can actually walk in and see the interior of a hanok. There are also many shops there where you can engage in some craft works, like embroidery or knot tying. However, these workshops can be a little pricey. "
A well preserved old section of the city,"There are only a few sections of the village that are worthwhile. Otherwise, it is too modernized (people actually live in those houses). I guess I expected a isolated neighbourhood frozen in time. Bring a map with an itinerary so that you dont wander needlessly."
You can't miss it.,"This is a very pleasant neighborhood to visit, with lots of little shops, restaurants and tea houses. It gives you the opportunity to feel like you have left Seoul to enter a small village. Lots of tourists in the main streets, so you might want to go through the side streets. That is what we did and we were often alone."
Some very nice parts - and some less exciting,"Not far from the Gyeongbokgung Palace you'll find this interesting neighborhood. I couldn't stop comparing it to the absolutely lovely ""Sannenzaka Ninenzaka"" in Kyoto. And that was probably a mistake....because Kyoto wins big-time.But on its own it is actually a nice part of town. Unlike Kyoto, where the area is filled with lots of shops, restaurants and tearooms, this area here is filled with actual houses where people live in.There are the occasional shops and a few tearooms, but for the most part is consists of residental buildings. And these are very pretty, authentic, traditional Korean houses....the Hanoks, hence the name of this area.At times it is quite a maze of narrow streets, some quite amazing, some a bit less interesting. If possible, pick up a road map from the tourist guides. They wander around this area.Some parts have really stunning views, check some of my pics for that. It is also nice to see people wander around in traditional clothes (Hanbok)....even though mostly rented (free access to all palaces if dressed like that). The combination of the Hanoks and the old-school dressed pedestrians give this area a lovely charm.Since people do live here, be a bit respectful. There are signs everywhere with a few ground rules. Even though many tourists completely ignore these, especially when it comes to the noise. Too bad.So, it's not as great as Sannenzaka Ninenzaka in Kyoto. But a lovely part of Seoul nonetheless. And in walking distance from the palace. Be sure to visit both.Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
Beautiful and peaceful,Me and some friends rented Korean outfit and walked the streets for about 2 hours. I highly recommend doing this. We had a lot of fun.
Nice Walk! But be Quiet Inside!,I enjoyed walking around here. the walk has an inclined pathway and it was difficult for me since I went here at the end of my DIY trip for the day! Best to go here in themorning when you ahve full of energy. But everything is worth it. Very Korean at all aspect. These are actual private residences so always keep quiet while touring around.
A village near the palaces ,"A part of Seoul with old houses. As these houses are private, you can't enter them.Beware of the art shop in the beginning of this village - they try to rip-off you.And also beware of a private observatory on the top of the hill. You can see signs to this private observatory which leads you the wrong way. Better to go up to a long street where many free lookouts are available."
Cool Village,"One of the places that is a must go if you are in Seoul. Coming from a place where there are no more villages, this is very interesting to see how the houses are uphill and stacked next to each other. Recommended"
Great place,"You can really have the feeling of old Korean here. I love the atmosphere. But, it will be great shall there are more information about the area. No tourist information there. "
Be prepared for uphill walking,"15 mins walk from Anguk station Exit 2. It's actually a residential area so you can't go inside the houses to see. It was hot when we went so the fruit flavoured soft ice cream was a wonderful treat. Love the grape flavour best, tastes just like grape bubble gum! It's uphill walking so wear comfortable walking shoes. We dropped in to a traditional Korean tea house for a drink and to rest. The cold drinks served were really refreshing. Quite pricey though. "
Old streets in modern city,If you want to see old houses in modern city yoy have to visit this kind of skanzen we call it. But houses here are living ones.
Great FREE thing to do,"I just loved walking around this place, its a little slice of old world Korea stuck inside a concrete jungle, LOVED IT EVEN THOUGH IT RAINED ALL DAY - just a good excuse to stop and sit in a cafe for an hour"
Beautiful and unique ,Step back into time when you visit Bukchon hanok village. Very nice place to see easy to get to. It's about a 10 minute walk from the subway. 
Well worth a visit.,Took me back to bygone days.Do visit the information centre first.Volunteers give free tour.Pick up a very useful map to help walking round the area.
Historic Traditional KoreanAlley,"Very pretty little alley. They said it has been there for 600 years. Don't forget to dress up before you get into the alley. The shop just around the corner, and they are renting Hanbok. You will get the best experience walking in the Alley"
Must see ,"I had one free day during my business trip in Seoul and decided that I wanted to see the traditional Hanok village and I was happy I decided to go there after the visit at the Palace. It was a lovely neighborhood to take a leisure walk, cute little coffee shops and local noodle shop there. "
Just OK,"We enjoyed seeing the old neighborhood, but not sure it was worth the walk up the hill to do it. Lots of posting about ""Private Residences"". Combination of residential and small shops."
Lost in the city,I love the fact that seoul still preserve the traditional houses quite well. Tourists still able to stroll sround the neighborhood and enjoy the scenery while being lost in the trace of Jeoseon. Sometimes I feel like I'm time travelling.Be reminded that real people live in the area as it's a real neighborhood. So please be mind of your voice while strolling around.
Hanok Village,Visited Hanok Village. It's a nice 1 hour stop over to visit traditional Korean houses and take some great photos. Theres one house towards the beginning of the street where you can walk around inside. Make sure to grab some photos at the top overlooking the village with the city back drop. 
Great historic place to visit during spring cherry blossoms or fall foliage,"This is a cool place to see some historic Korean residences, tea houses, and shops. It is an especially photogenic place during the spring cherry blossoms bloom time and during the fall to see autumn colors. I would recommend bringing a camera and simply enjoying a stroll around the many streets of the village. You could also rent Korean Hanbok costumes to wear at one of many shops in the village, if you want to have a fun and experience part of the culture."
Take the map and you wont get lost,It has much photogenic spot inside so i suggest you to take the mapAnd it has some store that sell clothes with cheap price..What a surprise
Guided walking tour,"Good thing that we booked for the free local guided walk otherwise we might not appreciate as much the history and culture of this place other than seeing the type of traditional Korean house. Started at Unhyeongung understanding the history of this palace, the differences in the gender affecting the housing and decor before walking to see the high school where Winter Sonata was filmed. Followed by the hanok village itself where the guide also brought us to see the Kokdu museum and sharing with us which houses were used by which k drama with which popular Korean actors/actresses. Recommend to go for this guided tour rather than walking by yourself plus it is Free!! "
Love this Quaint Village,"Quaint place to go..Anguk Subway Line. Be prepared for a long walk and absorbed in the atmosphere. Here one can see many of the young & tourists will dressed up in Hanbok (National custume) and walk around here. A very lively pleasant scene...and they do look very good in them. Took us half a day here, Absorbed in their culture, there are people still living in the Hanok Village, thus one need to be aware and try not to disturb the neighborhood peace & serenity.There are also some nice shops here too...quaint local restaurants too..Seeing the Hanboks I get the feel of being drifted into their period dramas...One get free entry into the Gyeongbokung Palace. This is the original Palace , the other Changdeokung Palace is the UNESCO site. Both palaces situated around Bukchon Hanok Village...but rather far away from one another...Once you are around here, one can get to Insadong as well.Thus one need a full day of energy to do the whole area outside Anguk Subway!"
Close to Insadong,It's nice to see where locals live although there are so many tourists that many locals are moving out. There are lots of signs asking people to speak quietly. Walls are thin in Korea. The old architecture is a great photo op. 
"Traditional houses, and that's it","Nothing much in the area except to see the traditional houses. There is a famous lookout spot for you to overlook Korea, but the view is not great. Headed to the palaces shortly after."
More than the main street,The stroll their is definitely a great one. You ahloud definitely go in the high streets that are in the north part for more original buildings. 
Good way to experience old korean architecture,"I've been there on a transit tour by Incheon airport.It's a nice area with an old houses. Most of them are residences, so you need to be quite"
This place has to be seen,This Village was nearly wiped off the map during the occupation period in Korea's history but the residents set about rebuilding the Village in the same manner as was previously on the site and they did a great job a unique wander around 'a historic village' albeit reconstructed some 50 years ago. A great job done
Beautiful ,I was in Insadong and just followed a crowd to see where they were going and ended up here in the beautiful village area. The houses are well kept and mixes in with new coffe shops along the streets. I was amazed by all the cozy coffee shops and would love to have more time to just sit here and relax and people watch. The streets have something old and something new and ha a very artistic expression. I will spend more time here on my next trip to Seoul for sure. There were also a lot of people walking around in traditional costumes that you can rent on an hourly basis. 
A pleasant stroll,This is definitely a highlight if you are in the area and seeing the palaces either side of it. You won't spend long here since there is only a couple of streets that actually contain the old houses but they are very photogenic. 
여유롭게 둘러 봤다면 더 좋았을...,"관광객이 너무 많아 천천히 돌아보지 못 한 것이 너무 아깝습니다만, 너무 큰 기대를 하지 않고 아기자기하게 펼쳐진 골목길을 둘러 보고 현대식 건물들 사이에 남아 있는 옛 모습들을 즐긴다면 더 좋았을 것 같습니다. 단, 음식점들이 너무 고가인 관계로 잘 조사한 후에 적절한 식당을 미리 알아 가는 것이 좋겠습니다.It was a big island surrounded by modern buildings. It is good to walk slowly through back alleys. I would like to recommend to wear Han-Bok (Korean traditional costume. there are many rental shops) and take some pictures in front of traditional houses."
hanok village,"quiet and beautiful village, remind you and give you a picture of an old Korean people's villages, beautiful experience within this village,there are places to buy souvenirs"
Well preserved traditional houses,"Bukchon originally was just a small residential village and due to the exposure of the K-dramas and became a tourist spot. The village preserved the traditional house structure and design of Korea. It's actually nice to walk around the area. There're nice cafe and restaurant around that offers traditional teas and dishes.And you can see staff walking area with a ""quiet"" sign, cause Bukchon is still a resident place."
Nice area to walk around,"The Bukchon area spreads around Anguk Station. The area is quite large, so it may be a good idea to plan in advance based on what you would like to see. I chose the area where you can see the palace and traditional houses, since I had a limited time in the afternoon. If you have more time, you could walk more and see more. I found a free map/area guide along the way from Anguk station, and it was quite informative as well. People live in those traditional houses, you'd better not to disturb them."
Beautiful traditional houses ,I visited Bukchon hanok village with my friend. I like those beautiful traditional houses. Eventhough they were old but those owner maintained them very well. Unfortunately we cannot enter those because they are private residence. 
a place to wander,"Next to the Gyeongbokgung palace, this village has great cafes, restaurants, art galleries and shopping. As a tourist destination it is promoted as streets of older style Korean houses, so all the delightful shops and art work was a bonus. Loved the Interesting murals on the walls of the village. I would enjoy going back there again for a longer time."
Hanok houses worth seeing,It's worth seeing the Hanok village but (honestly) it's a pleasant hours walk nothing more - you'd struggle spending a whole day there...
Beautiful palace !,Cant be here for long coz this is a private house for some peoples. And please be quite here if you dont want to makes the 'ajumma' with a board angry ;))Better you take a pic here with using hanbok !!
Authentic traditional Korean houses which are not made for tourists,"This is a real residential area which are not specially made for tourists.The owners of the houses are still staying in the house. Therefore, tourists are always being reminded to be silent.A must go in Seoul to experience the old seoul culture. Quite a bit of up hill and down hill walk but definitely worth the visit."
Just waste my time,"The village was not far from Anguk subway station, around 20 minutes on foot up to a small hill, but to be honest, there was nothing much to see or to enjoy. The old houses in traditional and typical Korean style were there but they were modern with luxury cars and so on. Tourists flooded it with hanbok and camera to take their selfie pictures just to show off on social networks. We don't recommend this to those who look for a real culture of local Korean without being frustrated by the tourist flood."
Not impress,basically im not impress with bukchon hanok village. it waste my time for 1hour. it walking distance to gyeongbokgung palace & national folk museum. 
Rows of Old Korean Houses,This is a private area wherein you can see old Korean houses. A bit steep for walking and lots of tourist. Good to go to see the traditional houses in Seoul. 
Touring Cyclists ,"It was great to see the five different houses in one place. English interpretation is proved, both on the signs and in the pamphlet. You can view all the rooms and there contents, unobstructed , but not access then."
Wandering old Seoul,"Make sure to spend time wandering the streets of Bukchon while in Seoul. There are guides and a route, that takes you up some lively streets with cute little shops and artist galleries, and also quieter neighborhood streets. We very much recommend trying to do the whole loop, as it is a great way to see the beautiful old Hanoks and neighborhoods. Make sure to leave time to pop in and out of places that intrigue you, and if you have an extra hour to try your hand at learning some traditional Korean arts from the many workshops tucked into the streets."
Picturesque glimpse into the past,See the traditional style of houses which are still lived in today. Many have been converted into shops & studios but plenty are still lived in. There are some nice views over the city from the top of the hill. 
Me and my boyfriend trip,We went there and walk around the village. There have many couple weared the traditional korean dress and took a photos and The best thing is Bulmakgol hahaha that is a delicious big cow ribs I ever had.
just an area of old buildings,Did not really sure what to do here. Too crowded to take a decent pic. Lots of cafe and art gallery. A maze of old buildings.
A nice walk in the park...,"This is a great activity to pass a couple of hours in Seoul. It's a beautiful little walk, and interesting to see the replica houses on the grounds. An excellent choice for families with younger kids! "
Serene,Beautiful gardens and a lovely place to spend an hour or two just strolling through the gardens and the traditional buildings. 
Nice picturesque area,"Nice area on a hill, and very touristy, with small shops, some restaurants. Surprisingly many new buildings inbetween old ones (or old looking ones)."
Ok at best,Not sure if i missed this hype completely but the area is a blast from the past and a proliferation of independent stalls. Certainly can use an hour or two here. 
Excellent Way to Spend Half a Day,Old town Seoul. Lots of shops and restaurants. Many pedestrian walking streets. This is where the palaces are. Good way to get a sense of Seouls history and pleasant area to spend half or a full day. Make sure to visit one of the palaces.
"Walk, Walk & Walk !!!",Can see the original house of how they stay way back till now maintaining the same structure.Be sure you are quite cos they are actually stay inside the houses
Ancient Korean Village ,Decided to visit this part of Seoul as it appeared in some Korean drama before . These traditional Korean houses are actually with residents inside so the tourists have to keep their voices down as not to disturb them . Great for photo shooting especially with Hanbok ( Korean traditional attire)which you can rent from a few shops around. Can see some couples have their wedding photos taken here. Leisure strolls along the narrow alleys while admiring this historical architectures is fun & relaxing.Worth a visit if you want to learn about the ancient culture of Korea!
a little bit tricky to find this exact area,"nice place to take photos, especially if you already renting the hanbok and wearing them before going to this place. the perfect itinerary was going to rent hanbok around the palace, going to palace and strolling around and after that you can go to this village with that hanbok (because usually the renting time was just 2hrs or 4hrs). "
What A Nice Village,"You get to see how the traditional/ older houses were and you can enter some. It would be interesting to live here. These houses are actually lived in, so be conscious of where you step and keeping the noise levels down."
Lovely architecture,"We decided to rent a 'Hanbok' (traditional Korean attire) to take photos. The photos are cute, be warned the outfit is quite layered and there are a lot of steep walking. We were pretty hot and sweaty, but the time we were done but it was a perfect opportunity to sit in one of the many cafes or homes that offered drinks."
Pretty Vilage,"You have to hike to explore Bukchon Hanok village , The house is pretty some house have beautiful garden inside. There are craft shop and hanbok rental shop around Bukchon Hanok Village."
Ancient Korean Residences ,"This is actually not a tourist area but private residences! People stay in these homes. Try to stay quiet and respectful while exploring the area. The village has many old Korean houses. Little shops and eateries line along the streets of the exits, and you can rent a hanbok to walk in all day at a rental shop nearby. "
Crowded but still worth visiting,I do feel sorry for the residents in the area. The crowd were just ignorant to the fact that they are really noisy even though there are signs everywhere asking them to keep the noise down.I still think it is still worth visiting the village. The hanoks are pretty and the area is safe and pleasant place for easy stroll. Try to avoid the crowd and come early in the morning.
Walk down the nice and traditional neighbourhood,Beautiful place to take a walk along the traditional Korean houses which there is people staying there. Will see alot of silence sign on the door. Still a good place to walk and take picture. 
Time stops in Bukchon Hanok Village,"The alleys brings you back to the past. The beautiful architecture of the structures there are affidavits of the history. Bukchon Hanok Village preserves South Korea's traditional art by offering activities with trainers to everyone. In the small room, one could feel the passion of the trainers with the intricacy of the handicrafts made. It was a wonderful experience for a first timer with clumsy limbs. "
Soothing Cultural Walk,"It was raining but still fun to be walking along the ancient alley.By passed some shaggy old gift-shops & fragrant house that leads to a hilly pebble route to the hilltop. The view is fogged by pollution from China so the post-card view is not there, still there are old architecture and natural landscape that's worth the walk.TO enhance on photography & free entry, rent traditional Hanbok from Insadong  for 4hrs 10,000Krw which will definitely bring memory and joy looking at them years later. ALSO, Hanbok-wearer has free admission to UNESCO sites: Gyeongbukkong, Museum, Village... etc"
Lovely place for a visit in spring,We were lucky to enjoy the beauty of the cherry blossoms while we were strolling the area which has many little shops offering interesting finds.Nice place to spend your day in a relaxed atmosphere.
Travel,"There are a lot of things to visit, you will see the traditional korean's house and very friendly people at that village."
Cultural,"There really was nothing much to do here but take pictures and some stroll around it, so overall it was simply okay."
time slip,I walked on old street. There are many old korean style houses around the area. Tourists are wearing traditional clothes and enjoying like TV drama stars who act as girls in old palace. There are many rental costume shop. I wanna try someday.
Picture perfect houses and streets,"A nice area to walk for a couple of hours. Lots of places to have coffee, tea and food. Interesting little stores scattered among winding narrow streets. Lots of other tourist but lots of locals too!"
Prettiest little district in town,Must visit! And take lots and lots of pictures.Every spots are picture spots. Don't ever miss coming here.Period.
45 degree angle,"If you're a fan of treadmills and you've been doing the climb and these streets are all yours. The scenery is beautiful and the cultural heritage is surely there. This is not a museum nor a public place, these are people homes and they live inside there. There's a lot of warning not to be noisy and appreciate the neighborhood but seems like the local teens are the one that so noisy, all the tourists from abroad. At least when we were there, are all paying respect and keep their voices down. Many girls wearing gorgeous hanbok took pictures here and there's a delicious delicacies like octopus, taebokki. And i love the perfumery there too. A must visit for sure. on the top of the road there's like a temple, but walking there is a bit tough, do use walking shoes. "
Bukchon Hanok Village Day Tour,"On 10th April, I, Chiu Yong Yong and my friend Low Soh Lar had the chance to meet tour guide Mr Lee Nam Su on this trip. The trip was very interesting. And the guide was very illuminating. The guide was not pushy and was very attentive and helpful. "
A walk along traditional village,"We came to this place by subway, stop in anguk station (orange line) and walk by 700 meter.This village is beautiful, there are some traditional houses, shops, small but cozy cafe, alleys with unforgettable memories.In some shops you can borrow hanbok, traditional dress with many color. Local people and tourist like to spend their time here.One fine day, we stroll along the village, this village also residential area, so we have to keep silent.If hungry, there're a lot of snack seller. I tried toppoki (traditional snack), strawberry mochi and enjoy them so much."
Great traditional experience ,"Loved the vibe of this place. Great picture opportunity and a few places to rent Hanbok. This area has lots of small cafes with nice earthy feel to them. We spent about two hours clicking some memorable pics in this beautiful part of the city. Please keep about 20 USD for renting a hanbok , locker and other accessories. Do visit early as it can get crowded with visitors who are here mostly for pictures in the traditional outfits."
Nice view,At least half day tour. Must try Hanbok at only 5000 won rental. Many shop. Wonderful scenery. Also have a lot of restaurants. Free enter.
Bukchon Hanok Village,This is a beautiful and interesting part of Seoul with the old-style architecture faithfully preserved and renovated. Many great photo opportunities as you walk around. There are a number of nice shops in restaurants as well. Arrive early to avoid the hordes of tourists in period costume.
a taste of old Seoul,"An awesome place to walk around and feel the old Seoul, with gorgeous traditional houses.Great place for photography. the streets are narrow, downhill and uphill. Wear good walking shoes."
A small village worth visiting ,Came here after reading reviews. Managed to find after following the instructions on the street map. Walked around for nearly an hour 
Beautiful Cultural place,This is an awesome cultural place with beautiful architecture. Very nice walk with many old traditional houses. You will run to many visitors in Korean traditional hanbok. Such a wonderful place to visit in Seoul.Surrounding this village is a number of small and cute boutiques.
Quaint old houses and nice cafes,"Strolling along the quaint old houses of Bukchon village was relaxing. It is a residential area so one needs to take note not to be too rowdy. The residents seem to be used to living in a tourist attraction and a few of them even sold drinks like barley tea.There is also a row of cafes along a main road beside the village. I had a green tea latte at Osulloc and I'm still missing it. The cafes are beautifully renovated and nice to walk along them. If you are in a group, you could also try cafe hopping."
Traditional yet designger,The traditional houses in the hanok is very well an inspiration for building designer bunglows in today's era!! I liked it very much.
A great afternoon! ☀️,"After visiting the main large palace, we found ourselves discovering Bukchon Hanok village. It was that far away. Great neighbour full of beautiful shops. Lots of people walking around. A wonderful atmosphere. Stop at a traditional Korean tea house! Shoes off. Sit on the floor. Beautiful tea! "
Cultural and architectural,I love the look of the buildings. The architectural and colors are very captivating. A good place for photography and you can also rent the hanbok (culture wear) and take photos around there. A lot of nice buildings. Good for half day tour. 
Cultural..awesome architecture!,"Hign on a hill, many steps to climb but well worth the visit. From the highest point you can see the roofs of these homes and also their open courtyards in the middle of most homes, a unique architectural point. One word of advice: please enjoy it in silence or talk softly since it is the residence of many people. Please do not litter. The residents are nice enough to allow us to traverse in front of their homes to take a peak into their historical culture so please do be respectful. "
Great Place for Photo worthy pictures.,"The first time we set foot at Bukcheon Hanok Village, we fl in love with the old traditional houses with a modern twist. Fast forward today, we went back to the same place to have our wedding photos taken. Highly recommend anyone to visit this place of interest and to take time for a slow stroll to absorb the beauty in it."
Interesting korean Village,Walking along the street with nice architecture seen @village. Lovely place with a typical touch of Korean culture.
Where the present meets tradition!,"Lived here for 6 months! WOW! Quintessential traditional Korean! Beautiful traditional buildings and you can rent out Hanbok costumes (traditional Korean attire) to complete the feeling. A part of all tourist stops when visiting Seoul, and just to the right of the Royal Palace and the Blue House. Some superb gastronomic cubby holes .... eating is Seoul is overall cheap and an unforgettable experience - after a total of 18 months ... a complete convert!"
Beautiful ,"Walking through the streets is so nice, seeing the old style hanok homes, also before going into the hanok streets there's a lot of cool shop for souvenirs or for food too."
Wonderful old houses,Beautiful old houses here really nice to walk around almost car free. Lots of people wear traditional dress while hoing around
Intersting Site,Historic Japanese homes from the early 1900s preserved and restored to look as they did originally. People still live here so there are signs all over asking for quiet as loads of people wander the narrow streets and paths up and down. Interesting to see but not a whole lot you can really do here..
Very lovely place. Typical part of Korean history,"This small village really takes you back to the Emperial era in Seoul, with its traditional homes and the nearby residential areas."
Very cool area in Seoul,This was a neat little area of town with some great houses. Cool old neighborhood. Great restaurants near there also. Hiked to the top and checked out a lot of the houses. Definitely recommend seeing this area.
Average,Alight at Anguk stn exit 1/2. Pretty much a distance(to me) from the station. There are maps nearby to facilitate the search. U can take pictures but be silent pls. There are a few convenience stores on the way.
Tradition meets modern,"Loved walking around here. The main street is all modern, shops and restaurants. Up the side streets you find traditional homes and residential areas. Some hills are steep. Really great to see the contrast. Many Chinese tourists hire hanboks and pose for photos here! Funny to watch. I think this is a must visit place. "
Very historical,Loved walking through this historical area. Many young people were walking around in Native Korean attire who were glad to be photographed with us. 
We LOVED our time here,"Bukchon Hanok Village was #1 on my list of things I was excited to see in South Korea. We stayed at a wonderful Hanok Guesthouse (check out Raon Guesthouse) and were able to explore the area with our host as a guide. Honestly wish we had spent the majority of our time in this area of South Korea, and less time in the more city areas in the city-proper. Take your time exploring the quaint shops and restaurants here and being part of the village's authentic lifestyle."
A blast from the past,Stroll through this area to see the traditional hanok homes/buildings. Some have been restored and are much more modern looking. I enjoyed chatting with a local shopkeeper that invited me to stay and enjoy a baked sweet potato with her. This was another favorite area of Seoul
charming neighbour!,"pros:- charming neighbour with traditional korean house (please low down your voice theres residence within the house)- you should come here early morning to get a good picture. during day there are so many tourist walking around.- good place for photography and sight seeing- its free to walk aroundcons:- very small areas. you can finish less than 1 hour- not many store, cafe and restaurant within the areas. mostly just residence house- you need to walk around hilly areas.- not a good place to visit during rainy day- i dont see any public toilet around the areas"
Pretty Neighborhood,"I just love walking around Bukchon Village, its so pretty, so many cheap boutique, hidden instragamable cafe. Just pretty.."
Boring,Unless you're into olden days architecture there is nothing much for you to do or see here. It is like walking around outside of people's houses and taking pictures as if we (or they) are aliens. I don't understand the hype about wandering in a housing area. 
Be prepared to walk uphill,Nice little cultural village with traditional houses. Have good walking shoes if you're going there. There are a few good souvenirs stores as well as nice small restaurants and snack stalls. We were there on a beautiful sunny Saturday so it was quite packed.
The Modern World Is Creeping into The Past,"You can get a sense of days gone by when you stroll around Bukchon Hanok Village - A Hanok is the name for a traditional Korean house and there are some 800 of them in and around Bukchon. You have to hunt for scenes where there are no electricity lines, tourists or other modern paraphernalia for your perfect photo. You do get a sense that many of the properties have be restored with modern materials and the area seems gentrified with trendy art and food outlets in and around the village to cater for the tourists."
Nice area.,"Nice area to walk. Old Korean houses, smaller streets, souvenir shops. Nice place to escape from cosmopolitan Seoul."
Charming!,"A dream come through to visit this village. It was a lovely walk around the many streets of the village and taking pics at the famous spots no.5 and 6. I even located the hanok used in the kdrama ""Personal Taste"". Best to go early to avoid big tour groups. I got there before 9:30am on a Sunday and it was not crowded yet. It would be great to stay in a hanok style accommodation for my next visit to Seoul!"
Hanok Village,"There are a lot of Hanok Style homestay around this area. Besides sightseeing , there are some food stall and local made craft around this area as well. Generally it is a residential area ."
Great traditional quarter,"Similar to the better known Insa-dong, Bukchon consists of many small winding alleys with the typical Korean buidlings. Although it is very crowded it is great walking through the streets and enjoying the atmosphere"
Love this village!!,"If it's your first time visiting Seoul, this village is the perfect area to go right after Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's just right next to the palace, you just need to walk a bit.In the village there are a couple of guides walking around in uniforms. You can ask them where to start, where to walk, they'll guide you happily and give you a map. There are a few cute cafes to hangout, they look cozy. We did a good one round of the village in around 45 minutes included stopping for ice cream. "
Chic - nice,"Must visit!Located very close to the palaces and Insadong, i recommend to spend one day in these environment, plus the contemporary museum.End your day in this particular area to experience the nice upscale street stalls..dining was great."
An interesting area to walk around,"This place is filled with young men and women in traditional Hanbok costumes walking around the small streets which gives it an even more magical feel.I spent several hours browsing and observing, taking photos, having coffee and lunch here. It is a good place to rail on a lovely day. "
Family with young children.,Very traditional & unique..its gd tat such a heritage still exist. Explore around with my family till the top..Amazing scenaries with those many mountains.took pics with those whos wearing traditional hanok costumes. Lots of tourists n definately will come again..
Visit if you have time,It was ok but not really great. If you have extra time or have exited angkuk station; why not. The walk from the Angkuk station was quite long so you're legs will be a little sore when you actually get there. The alleys were ok but not thay great for me because they didn't look that old and there were signs of modern living like plumbing and electricity
Unique pretty village in the cetre of Seoul,"Stay between 2 biggest palaces in Seoul, Bukchon Hanok village is so awesome pretty with all traditional architect designs. You should borrow Hanbok and walk around to visit Bukchon and take many many colorful phótos. The air's so cool and fresh to enjoy your day here. Tips: 1. Borrowing Hanbok in Insadong street ( oposite the way to come in Bukchon) with 15.000 won/ 4 hours. I checked some other places, the price is more expensive than in Insadong.2. You can also visit 2 palaces beside at the same time when wearing Hanbok and you will got a FREE TICKET "
A taste of old Seoul,"We visited on a sunny afternoon in late-March, after going to Changdeokgung palace in the morning. It's a nice walk through narrow streets lined with old-style houses, some of which are coffee shops. There were lots of tourists but everyone respected the privacy of the local people and kept their voices quiet. The views from the top of the hill were great and we enjoyed wandering around for a few hours. "
A walk in the past,"In a top 10 ""must see"" list, I know to visit Bukchon in the palace district. It was a pleasant surprise to be in a cultural preservation section in the middle of downtown Seoul. My only mistake was not to plan to eat there. There're many little restaurants along the alleys, which I vow I will go back next time I visit. Although not many people speak English, the vendors graciously point seemingly lost tourist like myself in the right direction. Definitely bring a good camera, if you love taking photo. I wish I have mine, but I have to content with my camera phone. Enjoy the exhibit at the visiting center; and read the history of the village at the front. Seeing modern shops w/in the well-preserved traditional structures was simply incredible. The pride of the community is hard to miss. You won't be disappointed."
Too many tourists,"I visited the area with the free walking tour provided. Our guide, Miss Kim, was a funny and charming old lady. Unfortunately the area was crowded with tourists. So it was impossible to get a good picture. Moreover they were very noisy so there was no serenity there. I felt pity to the residents who live there. I enjoyed the visit to Dr. Baek In Je's beautiful historical house, which is located in the area. It was less touristy too."
"Traditional, charming and quaint village in Seoul!!!!","Sandwiched between the 2 main palace complexes in Seoul, this village is quintessential example of a traditional Korean village. It has numerous streets (uphill/downhill sometimes) and they run through traditional houses and quaint estates. It has great photo opportunity and best time is to visit during dusk. Please keep in mind that is primarily a residential area.Must visit in Seoul!!!!"
Traditional Korean Houses,"A good place to go to visit an actual residential area of Traditional Korean Houses. You just need to keep quiet though as posted on the signs within Bukchon Hanok Village. Not an easy place to pinpoint though, I wandered around a bit before I was able to find the place."
Bukchon Wanderings,"We took the subway Line 3 to Anguk Station. At first we wandered around aimlessly until we walked into the Seoul Hanok Center where the helpful staff not only showed us around the whole place but also gave us a map titled ""Bukchon Wanderings"".She told us that we can continue our walk following the yellow line on the map which is a big loop around Bukchon covering all the attractions, view points etc. We're pleased to say that we covered the whole route in 2+ hours of leisurely strolling, stopping at the various view points to take pictures or o get a better knowledge of the attraction. We even stopped for a cup of coffee at a private observatory that not only gave us a place to rest our feet but also a good view of the surrounding area. One can go into the many museums, galleries, workshops as one fancy. Of course there are shops, restaurants & cafes along the way. Enjoyed our morning walk thoroughly."
The wonderful village at Seoul,"The wonderful village at Seoul, many houses with the original style and traditional things.We can wearing hanok and walking around for taking the pictures here."
Lovely traditional houses and village,The area is very picturesque and unique with lots of character. There are interesting shops and museums to visit in the village but the sharp inclines and windy lanes can make it tiring for some.
Village frozen in time,"Great to spend an afternoon walking around. It'll take about two hours to go round the neighborhood where you can see the old houses, do some shopping or sit and watch couples/girls in their traditional costumes ""Hanbok"" walking around. They have maintained this residential area making it a very pleasant place to hangout. "
Beautiful walk between the traditional house,"If I come here again, might try to stay in one of the guest house here. Like many old town in the world, it fill with modern shop, coffee house, sunny and relax.Like some local student, I rent the traditional dress and took some photos, loving it."
HOuses!,"This place just like another dimension, the architecture and design was astonishing! i mean people still living there! who doesn't want to live in a beautiful place like that? the environment was really great! also this place was really close to gweongbokgung palace. By wearing the hanbok you can get a very great picture with this place! but yeah most this place you need to have stamina! climb uphill and downhill.."
Beautiful village,We went there at night so it was very quiet and very few people. You can see the N-tower from one area. We really enjoyed the HanOk style homes! Nice place to visit and take photos.
Traditional Houses,Felt like it was in the past walking through the traditional houses. There is also one house which was open to view for free.
Place for Tourist,"Bukchon Hanok Village is not really touching about traditional that much some of hanoks are renovated, new building designed to be the original but i did not disappoint it"
The other side of Korea,The place is sandwiched by 2 palaces and clearly shows how traditional houses were and there people still residing in those places. Only miss was we were unable to go in and visit the houses. 
Authentic Korea,Must place to visit. Just be aware that this is residential area and must observe silence everywhere. 
Nice,"A little flashback to how Seoul used to be before the sky scraper jungle.Nice houses there and nice walk. Shame that some tourists were very loud although many signs ""please be quite"" are scatterd in the area. After all it's still a residential area."
Overated,came here as it is recommended by a few friends but i dont think its worth visiting unless you really interested to snap a few photo like me..
Traditional Korean housing,"This district is packed with over 900 hanoks, traditional Korean houses. It retains the city's old appearance. It has bceom a popular filming location for movies and TV dramas. As it is still a residential area, so please respect the residents there. They do hanbok rental, traditional Korean clothing. So you can wear the hanbok and take pictures in front of these traditional Korean housing. Many retail shops selling survivors. A little bit pricey since it is tourist attraction place."
perfect for tourist,really very nice place.. although a very long walk..it features real houses in the middle of the city that reflects the early culture of korea.. alot of young people even rent Hanok and walk up the hill to take pictures.. scenery was scenic but it was really a long walk and because we went in winter.. the walk doesn't end up in sweats.. :D
A must visit place,It was so memorable to take picture there. This place is located near Gyeongbukgong so I can go there by walking.
Photogenic Spot in Seoul,"Bring your camera as there is a lot of photogenic spot here. Yes, it's a very touristy place so you might want to go early in the morning to avoid the crowd. This place located 10 minutes walk from Anguk station."
Fantastic!,Its amazing that this traditional village is still kept the way it was for more than a hundred years. Walking through this place is a really cool and refreshing way to feel..but be prepared to walk - up pretty steep hills. You'll find cool cafes and design stores in the area if you need a moment of relax. Cool area.
Put your walking shoes on!,"After you put on your walking shoes, go visit the Bukchon Traditional Cultural Centre near Anguk subway station first for an overview and don't forget to get a Bukchon Village Folding Map.Follow the routes suggested or wander leisurely on your own, there are plenty of coffee shops, tea houses, restaurants, shops around, more on the Samcheong-dong side. This could very well be made into a full-day event, especially if you throw in a visit to the art museum or art gallery in the area. Don't expect this to be a mini ancient city area where everything looks like it was from the Joseon Dynasty but along the routes suggested, the buildings and walls have been well preserved and taken care of. It's quite an amazing experience and it could be one of the best days you spent in Seoul!"
Cultural Visit and Worth It to Go,"If you want a cultural experience into the olden days of Korea, definitely check out the Bukchon village area out! There are a lot of cute side streets to go into, as well as areas where you can attend and take part in workshops. We went to an area where we were able to learn a lot about the actual etching on Korean traditional clothing and it was awesome to just get a better understanding of everything. Really cute homes designed with how it was back in the older days in Korea!"
ordinary tourist area,nothing much to see here except hiking up this small residential arealots of tourists sometimesthere are also info guides in the area
Many traditional korean house,Very crowded and many traditional korean house. You can enter old house for tea ceremony but not free.
Traditional village,"A good place to explore the traditional Korean architect, peaceful and tidy. My suggestion is to visit during summer - autumn, maybe too cold to walk around during winter time."
A short walk away from the palace,Its good to see the architecture of the traditional homes. You can even take pics of yourself in a hanok traditional wear) in some stores. I wish i could've spent a night in a traditional home but they are quite expensive! Would love to go back to see it during the winter covered partially in snow
Taste of traditional Korea,"Bukchon is a place that you must visit while in Seoul. It's a neighborhood where you can see several traditional Korean houses. It is a residential area, so be respectful and try not make too much noise. I went early in the morning, around 9 and there were very few people there. It was great to take admire and take amazing pictures. From there you can see N Seoul Tower and it is amazing to see the contrast of the city around it.To reach the neighborhood stop at Anguk station, exit 6. Stop at the visitor center where you can get more information and map to explore the area and go to the top of the hill to see the cluster of houses. There are some houses that offer stay and tea ceremonies I did not participate."
Transit to the past,"I love this place. I love culture and traditional houses in Korea. Walking around, there's a combination of modern and traditional buildings. It really reminds me how important for us, not to forget our roots. "
Wonderful buildings,Mind blowing buildings. Very old and interesting layout. Free access. You need to pay money to enter old house for tea ceremony. Had higher expectations some sort of old market and stall. People still live in the houses. Perhaps thats why nothing much to do there. 
Korean traditional house,"Come there must be silence, its beauty and amazing view there... you may try to rent at homestay there to try experience living korea traditional houses"
Rather interesting with many shops and eateries. Abit difficult on a cold day. ,"It was quite a cold winter day when we explored this area. It's all outdoors so it can be difficult in the cold. But there's some shops or eateries to pop into if you must. We walked around many of the old houses and also went into some which were open for viewing, such as the tourism heritage house. Got a good feel of how the people lived in olden days. Quite a nice experience. Most of the eateries were closed from 2:30 to 5pm, so we didn't manage to get a tea time snack and hide from the cold even though we wanted to. It's just a nice place to wonder about and admire architecture and some old crafts too. The slopes can be quite steep, so people with weak knees may find it tough. Also, many houses here are still inhabited, so tourists must keep quiet and respect their privacy and take care of the environment. "
Takes you back in time...,"If you have a prolific imagination , you can imagine yourself back in time as you walk through the road ... the old houses... well kept...timeless"
Stroll at your own pace and explore traditional Korean housing,"Seeing the Bukchon village is a good thing to do on a nice afternoon. Be prepared to walk for about an hour through pedestrian-friendly streets, but keep in mind there are some hills. If you're visiting when it's really hot, you won't want to do it during the heat of the day. Because people live in these houses there are many signs asking for quiet and respect of private property. In the busier and more contemporary area, you'll find lots of restaurants, shops and treats. Another highlight is seeing all the tourists dressed in traditional Hanboks - great for photos.Enjoy the walk and the nice architecture."
Local culture preserved,"Quite uphill so be ready to walk, plenty of souvenier shops around and coffee shops for breaks and rest."
A chance to see a different side of Seoul,These are residential streets made up of the original types of houses. It's on a hillside so there are also a number of good viewpoints of the city and you get old/new contrasts. Some of the streets are steep.
Old traditional neighborhood between 2 palaces,"Bukchon Hanok village is an old neighborhood in Seoul located between the two royal palaces. This is a great walking area of town, with narrow, winding streets and traditional architecture. Mind the people holding the ""Shhhh"" signs :-) You really are walking through a residential neighborhood. At the top of the hill, on the east side of the walking tour part of the neighborhood, is wonderful, small ""souvenir"" shop, barely large enough for the proprietor and two patrons. The Korean shop keeper was so nice, able to communicate in English enough to help me buy a couple of gifts for my family. Within the village are some great traditional Korean restaurants too!"
"""Up & down"" wanderings :)","The experience was one of ""uniquely fun"" walking along these narrow streets flanked on both sides by traditional-styled houses or lovely compound walls (with roofs above as is the style unique to Japan & Korea) while pretty frequently having to negotiate the upward & downward slopes along the way (""steeper slopes"" on the left side than on the right side of the main street Bukchon-ro that divides the Village into two parts). And while some might just do a simple walk-around, I suggest checking out some 'workshops' which are on the right side of the Village (got to my first workshop after walking up for about 10 minutes to the right from the main street, followed by three more workshops including one for embroidery called The Han Sang Soo Embroidery Workshop and one for calligraphy or designs), and do keep in mind that they're not museums but places where people are actually doing stuff and where tourists can ""partake in"" their activities (not sure if you need like a prior booking for such though); and on the left side of the Village, be sure to go all the way to the far end where there's like a terrace with a railing from which there are great views of the mountains (not too far) and the city's skyline (somewhat distant).Coming by subway, Anguk Station (on Line 3) is where to get off, and the best exit is Exit 2 with just about a 5-minute walk straight ahead on the main street Bukchon-ro after coming out of the exit and you'll be right at the area where a right turn or a left turn will lead you up to the corresponding part of the Village (so yes, the right side for the 'workshops' and the left side for the lookout terrace at the far end as mentioned above; and my suggestion is to do the right side of the Village first, then cross the main street to the left side, then come back down from the far end on that side where you'll get to like a ""shopping street"" below that kind of intersects the main street after a few minutes' walk bringing you conveniently back to near Anguk Station for leaving the Village)."
just after the Palace Gyeongbokgung,perfect to do on the same day: the Palace Gyeongbokgung; Hanok Bukchon and the Buddhist temple. I really enjoy because it's like an outdoor architecture museum but actually people still leaving there.
Good place for take a walk,I used to take a walk from Myeongdong through Insa-dong and Samcheong Dong to reach here.Actually not very far but you can find the Korean’s life along this walk.
Worth the visit,"We went to the Bukchon Hanok Village. Be prepared to walk. The roads are very narrow and steep but it's worth the visit. However, it can get a bit crowded. It was very nice to walk along the houses. There were Street food along the way."
lovely village with boutique stores and shops ,"we walked around the area, lots of boutique stores along with the traditional housing architech. Nice area to spend about 3-4 hours wondering around but keep in mind its a tourist spot! "
traditional houses in a wonderful village that offers a lot,"Bukchon Hanok Village is home to many traditional houses, called hanok, that date back to the Joseon Dynasty. The name Bukchon translates to ""northern village"" Today many of these hanoks operate as cultural centers, guesthouses, restaurants and tea houses, etc. that give you an opportunity to immerse yourself into the traditional Korean culture. It's lovely to wander around here and take lots of photos. The doors and entrances are very photogenic.Let a cab take you up here and then walk mostly downhill."
It's a small traditional village,"A steep walk up to the nice view point of Bukchon Hanok Village. As it was winter, it's rather cold and energy do get depleted quickly. We rested and had traditional rice drink and ginseng tea in one of tea houses there. We got ourselves warmed and enjoyed the quiet feel about the village. Unfortunately we had a short disturbance by a bunch of rather loud tourists who came by looking to use the toilet. Be forewarned, this is pretty much a residential area with only a few tea houses in it. So it will be difficult to find rest rooms around here. It's good to be prepared or you will end up like the rowdy tourists group we met. In the end, they were refused and turned away as they have no intention to buy any drinks from the tea house. "
Historic buildings and great cafes and eateries,Great to walk round the old buildings. Interesting shops cool cafes and eateries. Sometimes a bit up hill but great to visit. 
Dainty 😍,"As cute as it sounds, this place does not have a main entrance that says 'Bukchon Hanok Village'. You just get to Samcheongdong and get up at any small hills that you see. The area around this place is somewhat magical and hard to believe. It was cold when I was there, leaving slippery icy roads to conquer. Lots of people with large cameras and hanbok. You will find coffee shops and perfume houses along the way. It was only a 15 walk up and down depending on how long you spend your time in the hills."
Samcheong dong,"Bukchon Hanok village - the place with the remained of traditional Hanok houses in the alleyway, where there are different upward & downward landscape scenery to see. Also, around Samcheong area, not to miss the art galleries & museums. Nearby is Gyeongbokgung."
Traditional buldings,Nothing much to mention about the area but one thing is worth mentioning was the samgyetang chicken we had before exploring bukchon village. food was great at affordable price
Picturesque but beware the hills!,"This is such a beautiful area where people actually still reside in. The area is hilly so be sure to wear comfortable shoes. On a day where I walked a lot, scaling the hills was a bit of a challenge. The architecture and the doors are so very beautiful."
Bukchon,"Nice traditional houses, interesting to look at. Some spots are great for photo taking. To view the inside of a house, you can get into one that has ongoing activities to have quick look and a few pictures - leave shamelessly if you are not keen to pay for joining, which we did. :P Does not need very long to finish the whole area, they look quite the same after 30mins."
Interesting,"Here there are some beautiful traditional houses, with many people walk around in the traditional clothes. Be aware it can get a little crowded! "
Nice place to go,There aren't that many cultural sights in Seoul. You find a lot of shopping culture but if you want something old school. This is a pleasant neighborhood to stroll around. 
Nice area,Dont forget to try hanbokI believe there is a lot hanbok rental hereI endedup going to place that I cant used it to far from the rental area
lots of streets to wonder round,"This is not a place to rush. Plan to be around for an hour or even more. Eat from the street stalls or from a local restaurant, then explore the streets and alleys with your camera at the ready. The tour buses mainly unload here in the afternoon, so try get here in the mornings."
Walk of immersion in old Korean culture,The Bukchon Hanok Village is a testament to the old Korean culture and history as hanok or traditional Korean houses were preserved. We joined a free walking tour offered by the Seoul Tourism Organization wherein we learned more of the history of Bukchon Hanok Village through their volunteer tour guides. This is a valuable and enriching experience for tourists.
Unique place for photo shooting,There are 8 tourist spots to take beautiful photos in this area. Just make sure u ask the cute guys in red who are from the tourist information centre where are the spots and you will get to take spectacular photos in the alleys between the houses. There are also shops offering hanbook experience where u can rent the Korean traditional clothes and walk around taking photos. These will be a good destination for bridal photo shooting. 
"Great walk around to see ""Old"" Korea","This is a great culturally-preserved area. It's nice to walk around and explore the different houses built and preserved. Gives you a feel what the ""Old"" Korea looked like in the days of past."
Traditional looking village that once inhabited only by the nobles.,I visited this charming little village with the Korea airport free tour. The village that once only inhabited by the nobles are all about narrow alleys and traditional houses with typical roofing.
A Must Visit,"It was packed full of tourists, but understandably so. Some of the most charming streets I've ever walked. Beautiful, intricate architecture on every corner of these homes (private residences actually) make for lovely stroll and great photo ops. What I found particularly striking was as you walk down these streets that sort of take you back in time, you look up and see the modern skyline as a backdrop. The Samcheongdong area is also a must visit. It is small, but very historic and the mountains in the background are so beautiful."
love the architecture seen in Bukchon,"This is a walking trip. You just wander around the streets of Bukchon appreciating the traditional korean style architecture of the houses here. People actually live in these houses so there are a whole lot of signs asking you to keep quiet, which ruins the look in my opinion but I can see how the locals might get annoyed with all the tourists walking around everyday here. It's a great photo spot to say you are in korea. There are lots of side streets and we took random turns and headed towards samcheondong to eat lunch. "
Beautiful and traditional Korean houses,"I highly recommend a stroll through Bukchon. It is very quaint peaceful, at least when we went (late afternoon after it stopped raining). Thee traditional Korean houses are very beautiful. If possible, go with a local who can point out interesting tidbits about the area (if you watch K-dramas some of them were filmed here, and certain celebrities also live here). Make sure you respect the residents there by remaining quiet and do not trespass onto their property by going off the streets."
Walk and meander around,"A great place to walk around and discover different activities and shops. It's an actual area where people live so be mindful of the residents. Come before 5 to experience the handiworks and the hands-on activities. We came too late for it, but it is still a picturesque area to meander. "
Native and traditional Korean atmosphere right at the center of the city,Very ancient mixed with modern ambiance which is very fascinating as you walk along the streets and corridor the village. Perfect to reminisce what does korea looks like way back those old times. Very impressive how they keep this attraction in a clean and modernized environment.
Bukchon Hanok Village Overrated,Bit of a letdown this traditional village. Place looks deserted except if you admire traditional korean architecture. Its a bit like a hilly walk behind back alleys. Nothing much to see.
The old and the new in harmony,"The Bukchon Hanok Village is a great place to stroll around to see the Hanoks of Seoul - I wish I had stayed in a Hanok Guest House, maybe next time - but unfortunately it is visible the process of less old houses and more of the new ones. "
Beautiful but Tiring place to visit,"This place is filled with lanes and lanes of traditional Korean houses. Like my friends said, this place is totally Instagram worthy and we took at least 3 hours walking around the neighborhood taking tons and tons of photo. You can easily rent traditional Korean Hanboks at only 10,000 Won for 2 hours just outside the neighborhood.1 thing to note is that, the neighborhood is filled with steep slopes, so it might get abit tiring after awhile as you have to constantly climb the slopes."
Essential part of a visit to Seoul,"Traditional houses, well maintained, and a lovely place to walk around in good weather. Good photo opportunities as well."
Not many old houses left ,"The old houses all seem to have ugly store fronts. There are a couple of old residences, but there are more houses with new construction using the old style - lovely wood but new. "
Beautiful traditional house!,Traditional house area to walk around. Surrounded by busy traffic and modern buildings yet the premise is quaint and picturesque. Modern meets traditional architecture is amazing too.This is residential area so quiet is a must in order not to disturb the people living here. Some slopes very steep and it’s all about walking up and down. Worth a visit!
My favorite place in Korea,It's a great place to see traditional style of Korean houses. Local people live in the house so it's not too touristy place. It's quite close to Samcheong dong with cool shops and restaurants and many Korean people hang out there.
Nice place for visit,Ancient village in the city. There are many nice shop near this village. Don't miss to visit here. This place is far from subway.
Traditional houses ! ,"The street is lined up with traditional Korean architecture. Good for photo taking. There is hanbok rental shop nearby $18000w per person for a couple of hours. Lots of tourists, can't take a photo without people in it. "
A hilly hike to see old houses,"We nearly got lost finding this area if it wasn't for the help of those 3 policemen. Located between Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces, this street lined with old houses is a great place to visit for those interested in old korean architectures. Please note that visiting this place involves a bit of an uphill climb."
"Cute village for walking around, pretty views",We spent an hour or so walking around and taking pictures before we got too cold to continue and had to go inside for mulled wine. You can go to the bukchon culture center and get a map that suggests a walking route and where to take the best pictures. There are also museums with art activities like making bracelets or kites or weaving but it seemed like you needed to have booked them in advance
chillin with your date,i've been there to discover more of korean traditional architecture but i actually think it's a nice place to walk and have a coffee with your boyfriend/girlfriend. Atmosphere is really calm.
Gross commercialisation now,"In its heyday, I'm sure Bukchon Hanok (Village) must be quaint and nice. Since it's becoming one of the main attractions of Seoul, and that tour companies have made this into one of their compulsory stops, you can imagine the hordes of tourists that are been thrown into the neighbourhood. Roads here are built hotch potch and they zig zag all over the place. I'm sure that occupants of houses along the main route would be annoyed with lots and lots of people overstepping their boundaries and taking selfie pictures of themselves in front of houses with any kinds of architectural merits. Most of the signs that I witnessed are more or less around the same theme: keep it quiet, don't step on our stairs, keep away. What does that tell you - not welcoming indeed. There are also user friendly signs all along the path to ensure that you are not swayed from your original path. In other words, some occupants are affected more than others. The vista of Seoul has changed over the years and so does Bukchon. Trendy boutique shops such as Gentle Monster (glass frame that's opted by K-Pop stars) and other designer shops have also set up their stores here. Therefore, historical village feel is gradually been interspersed with clean line edgy shops that you get to see at Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. Whatever it is, this is Bukchon now, and no longer the endearing Hanok. It's worth your while to visit but don't keep your hope high. Come out from Gate 3 of Angguk Metro Station."
A not so old village.,"Bukchon village is sold to tourist as the typical Korean Style Housing area. However, it is actually not really a old korean bulding style. "
Preserved Heritage ,"Traditional houses in the center of capital city. Need to be a little bit fit to climb the road, but worth it."
Traditional houses,Well preserved traditional houses. Good for photo taking. There's a lot of walking so be prepared. Very nice ambiance as the places are pretty quiet (other than a lot of students walking up and down as there are universities around that area)
Heritage neighborhood with traditional Korean houses,Nice locality for one who loves photography and taking pictures of heritage residences and shops. Interesting neighborhood with specialty shops selling Uniquely Korean souvenirs and food stuff. A little walking required to explore this serene neighborhood and it is well worth that little effort. :)
Traditional Korean Village with Fantastic Scenic Views,So the concept of the Buckhon Traditional Village is to showcase the Korean tradition and architecture and preserve it by means of creating a residential place around that concept. There are people actually staying in the houses and there are tours organised for visiting the place and looking at how the homes used to be constructed. However we had less time in hand and did not go for detailed exploration. Still even the outside view and walk around this place itself is enough to give you an idea of what a beauty it is!!! The culture is reflected through this place. Best Views and Scenic Place for photography. . . get your cameras out!!!
Should be in your itinerary,"This area is really near the Gyeongbokgung Palace area and it should definitely be in your itinerary for visit as the houses really are traditional and worth visiting. There are plenty of cafes and small houses operating as restaurants serving traditional Korean dishes, cafes serving coffee and cakes, and there were also an area for shopping. I particularly liked a shop which sold traditional Korean clothes though it would be weird for me to be wearing them out of Korea so i decided not to buy them."
Nice for pictures,"The whole area is basically a residential area with an traditional kind of architecture. It's nice to spend some time and have a slow walk around these houses. There're some stores selling things too. Things that are sold here are usually a bit pricy than outside. However, we should lower our voice while walking around as its a residential area. It's worth going to take some pictures and to know more about Korea. :)"
Interesting Architecture,"Very interesting architecture, brings you back to the old Korea. Do be prepared for steep climbs as the terrain is hilly. Also, the area is a housing area, as in people literally are staying at the houses you see, so do keep the volumes down. "
good walk,"still largely a residential neighborhood, not particularly interesting to walk around on your own. not very large, perhaps 15 minutes was all I needed see most. but could always add samcheongdong which is close enough."
Bit Sold Out,"The expectation of Bukchon was that it was literally a village that has remained in traditional Korean lifestyle despite its proximity to the city. Realistically though it is old buildings and a bunch of touristy sideshows. Expected to be here for a long time, stayed for probably ten minutes. Venture out of Seoul if you're looking for traditional. Bukchon Observatory is worth a look if you decide to visit (and if you can find it)!"
must visit,"This is a great place to see the real Korean village. it is a steep climb as some of the streets the branch off the main street are usaually up hill. There are traditional houses, shops, cafes... f you go high enough up you will have nice views looking over Seoulthere is also a small Korean temple that I ran across. it is pretty small and you have to go upstairs. This is a great place to walk around and get lost. sometimes the people that live there will have their doors open and you can see in. don't go up to the door but just look as you are passing by. great architecture"
A must in Seoul!,"My favourite area in Seoul! Down the hill is a lot of cozy streets filled with trendy shops and cafeterias! While coming up the hill you'll find yourself within streets among old traditional houses! Don't forget to look back while walking up, some streets boost amazing views over the city center! "
Nice to walk around,Cute replica of old Seoul. Some houses are inhabitat by locals or foreigners.Reminds of Disneyland but everything in Korea looks like that nowdays
Quaint village,"Not much to see when we were there, just the houses. But it gives you a glimpse of old Korean culture. "
A beautiful corner of Seoul,"On the advice of local friends I visited very early in the morning and walked up from Anguk Station. Although not too busy with visitors, there were already other people arriving so I can only imagine how crowded it gets. The houses are beautifully preserved and give a good insight into how Seoul may have looked during the Joseon Dynasty. I loved just wandering along the alleys noticing the roof details, intricate doorways and courtyards.Although Bukchon is a preserved village rather than a reproduction tourist attraction it is, not surprisingly, commercial, with many of the houses converted into galleries, guest houses and tea rooms but you can look beyond it and just appreciate the history.I visited very early in the morning and was able to wander around at my own pace and not feel too intrusive. Be prepared for a lot of walking up sloping streets!"
Bukchon Hanok Village,"These are the traditional type houses and contrast to the more modern dwellings in other parts of the city. There are hills and steps so it is a physical activity. Local shops are also a high;light with some nice craft stores along with the usual cheaper socks, etc shops"
Lovely,"I considered Bukchon as one of Seoul's historical sight seeing place to go. You can still enjoy the old Korean Village vibe through the houses architecture and narrow streets. I took the train and stop at Anguk Station, it's a walkable distance.If you happened to visit during fall -winter, I recommend getting there in the morning where the streets is still empty (some stores might as well). But it's the perfect time for you to actually look and enjoy the environment. The area is loaded with food, crafts, coffee & tea shops (Ossuloc Tea!). It's a huge area, so bear with the walk. If you're tired, take a stop at the nearest shops if you wish. There's a great Coldnoodle & dumpling restaurant near the road entrance (closest to Anguk St). It's in the narrow street. If you have problems with wanting a clean bathroom there's one in the Museum (near the bicycle parking area. A bit of a walk if you're around the north area. Might as well spend the whole day walking around if you love a good walk as much as I do.  "
Traditional house,"In this street you can see the traditional house of South Korea, be quiet in this street because of private area"
Korea Traditional,"It is said that Mandarines in pre-modern days dwelled here. Surprised to know that traditional dwelling were still kept in the area that is very close to the center of Seoul.Location is convenient,only taking subway for 5-10 minutes from the City Hall or Seoul Station, even though transtion of subway is required.Area in itself is not so big. had little steep ways.There had Constitutional Tribunal besides the area.Some shops held splashy signs before the facade, which broke atomosphere.When I went, other visitors are not so many, so I was able to walk around with keeping my pace.One house that seemed to have got renovation for exhibiting for visitors,where I entered and walked around inside, saw many traditional Korean daily items, which I did not know how to say, as pots for Kimchi cooking and traditional Korean style heater."
A Nice time to try Hanbok,Fully immerse yourself with the preserved houses by dressing up with a hanbok. Just be sure to be quiet and to not knock on the houses as they are privately owned as well
Walk Through History,"Walking the narrow winding streets flowing up and down the hills is like being in a time machine. It's not a museum, people do still like in there. You can visit some of the homes or check out local shops and restaurants. Great vistas from the streets in both daylight and night time. While in Seoul, If you can visit the Bukchon area!"
Really pretty but nothing exceptional,"The Bukchon village is really pretty. However I wouldn't get carried away. It's a small area, it's a very organized tourist experience and everything there is expensive."
A must visit!,"It is a village with traditional Korean homes, or known as HANOK. There are 8 photo spots to look for. However you can still take photos anywhere and everywhere. To go here take a subway to Anguk Station (Line 3) and go out from Exit No 2."
K-drama feels,"If you're a fan of K-dramas, you will definitely feel like one of the characters here. It's one of those scene where they climb up the hill going home or something like that (Haha!) You'll be able to go into one of the houses and see what it looks like on the inside. You'll also see people wearing the traditional Hanbok."
Just a few streets to look at,"Unlike some entire cities that you visit (think Rome or maybe Krakow) that are filled from pavement to the sky with historical sights, you'll get at best a few streets to visit. So not really immersive nor impressive. And because there's not much to see, you'll be sharing it with hundreds of selfies sticks, like medieval standards, waving through the air. It's primarily a residential with a few shops and you'll see some nice house frontage and cobbled roofs - a couple of streets are nice photo ops. "
Cultural Experience,"Great place to observe the palace from behind the walls. Its a long walk/trail about 60 minutes to complete the different observable areas or landmarks. A few up slopes and down slopes. The place also houses museums, hands-on workshops. On top of that, quaint souvenir shops and cafes and eating outlets. You can get the map from the tourist information centre in the area. The observant point is quite breathtaking.Be sure to be quiet as you walk with your friends or families as it is a residential area. You won't want to disturb the residences there. "
Lovely houses to view.,"This area was amazing to me in America we don't have whole neighborhoods that are 500 years old. I didn't feel bad because there are many signs telling you to be quite people love here, so don't take your LOUD friends. ;) "
Quaint and traditional,Worth the time exploring this quaint and serene village. The houses were unique and the scenics were picturesque. Plenty of tourists as you would expect but there are enough spaces to take the perfect photo. A must-go if you are in Seoul!
Nice morning walk in a traditional village,"We spent about 2 hours exploring the Bukchon village. As there are residents staying inside, we have to keep our noise level to a minimum. There are quite a few streets that are more traditional than the rest. I just hope that the new building are not invading the old style buiding structure further, else this village is not going to retain its tradtional images."
My favorite place from our trip,"I love the architecture, and what's more fascinating is that there are people still living there! There are a couple houses that are set up for tourists and you can pay to go in for some special activities. I also saw a house that is available for homestay."
Explore the Hanok,Exploring the Korean traditional houses up the hill. It's an easy walk with interesting views at all angle.Try the fried tteokbokki too.
Good experience ,An hour walk in this area is sufficient. You can enjoy the beautiful architecture of houses. Will definitely stay in one of the guest houses here in my next visit to Seoul. 
Quaint!,"Love the old traditional houses and tiny alley ways. And with little quaint shops peppered all over with good cafes and eateries, it is indeed time well spent on a cold afternoon. "
Worth to visit ,There are quite a few of traditional Hanok spread across the streets. All are very unique and quite well maintained.Quite a pleasant walk along these streets even in cold weather.
Bukchon village,If you are going to this place just to take photos. I will advise you to find the actual locations of the spot that you planned to have your photos taken. I went to this place twice in my trip and I spent hours running up nad down to find the 'right' spot.Please be prepare to trek the uphills
Tranquil and classy,"We stayed on one of these traditional houses that was converted into a hotel/homestay. Really lovely experience to be in such a cosy home. The owner was very helpful and upgraded us to a room that had an adjoining toilet. My family of five slept comfortably in the two rooms even though they were kind of small. The village or area itself is quiet and is a great place with quaint little shops selling souvenirs, clothes, Jewellery. They aren't tacky shops but are shops that sell affordable local brands. Most of the shops are located along two main roads but you won't find it as busy or crowded as Myeongdong which is another experience of its own. So while most tourists spend an afternoon walking and looking and the old houses, this was actually a nice refuge and charming place to spend a a couple of days at. We really enjoyed the cafes and interesting shops that we could take our time with and not be hassled by crowds. From here we could venture to Insadong which was nearby."
Not really,Actually this village wasn't what I expected. I didn't see anything really exciting about this place. I do not recommend 
"Well preserved historic neighbourhood, great place for a stroll",A rare example of historic Hanok house architecture in Seoul. It's a great area to stroll around. What's great about the area as well is that it's not completely overrun by tourists - there is still a real neighbourhood feel to the place.
Houses with lots of characteristics,"We strolled Bukchon and saw many houses with characters. Some are shops and some are residences. We went inside a few shops partly for souvenir and partly to just look at those houses.Due to the high volume of tourists, there were often local people held up signs to ask tourists to be quiet. "
Traditional Korean village,"Really worthwhile to visit and to combine with other visits to local palaces and the Insadong shopping area. You can start with this village and continue to the palaces on walking distance, then end at Insadong."
A residential area with a taste of old Korea,"Bukchon is just a residential area with a taste of old Korea and most of the houses were locked and closed when we visited there. Need to walk for 20-30 mins along the wall of Gyeongbukgung palace before reaching Buckhon. Do take bus or other transport to reach Bukchon. Honestly, nothing much in Buckhon and should be able to complete the area by 1 hour."
Old neighborhood,"There is a good amount of exercise involved- narrow alleyways, very steep slope and stairs. A good time to go would be in the afternoon. At the bottom there are a few shops and boutique stores. Dolls wearing traditional Korean dresses also found here."
Beautiful old Korea,"This district is very nice if you know where you're going, or if you have time to explore. It's not huge, but you might be disappointed. There is a famous street there, though, so make sure you see that one at least. The street goes uphill/downhill depending on where you are. Sometimes there are so many tourists there, so it might get a bit annoying. Bukchon is a walking distance from Gyeongbokgung palace (did I spell that right?). Also, sometimes people offer to let you inside one of their old houses there and give you a tour for a price. In my opinion, Bukchon is a must-see in Seoul. Not overwhelmingly fun, but just beautiful."
A little overrated but worth the visit.,"The road below the Bukchon Hanok Village had clusters of private galleries, cafes and shops which makes it fun to explore and just have a cuppa in. To get to the village - follow the brown signs and be prepared to climb up a steep flight of stairs. Once there - just walk freely and you will eventually come across the popular slope where people like to take photos in. There are free maps along the roads so just grab one and explore on. "
Terrific Small cottages full of history,I absolutely loved wandering the winding ways around this neighborhood. Quaint and delightful. Fun to walk about exploring. Caution to be quiet and respectful--this is someone' home!
Beautiful area to walk around,"This area has rows and rows of houses that are in traditional Korean style. There are signs that post recommended paths to walk through. It is residential area with people who still live in the houses, so being quiet is a must. Very nice views from the higher streets. Many of the streets are fairly steep, but it's not extremely strenuous once you get to the top area and walk back down. There are a few smaller boutique style stores near the bottom area, some small eateries, and some small souvenir shops. There are also some cultural buildings that are open to walk around in and some paid activities to do, such as wearing era appropriate costumes or making little trinkets to take home. Nice way to spend some time walking around. Beautiful views from the top and great architecture you won't find anywhere else."
Worth seeing and walking around,"These houses are being built in the middle ages and they are still in use. Beautiful. Nice boutiques and restaurants, little corner shops."
Nice walking area,"This is a nice area with some old style korean houses, with lots of caffes, small resturants, souvenirs and art. On the start in the tourist center take a map with the route to follow, helps not to get lost. It is quite a walk and you go high up with some stipe areas, to make the full round. Ideal for nice sunny weather. You can combine it with a visit to one of the two main palaces as you start / end close to them.Overall cc 1-2 hour is enough for attraction."
Beautifuel quaint village inside a modern metropolis,Loved the houses and how simply they are constructed. Felt like a trip back in time. Quiet in inhabited and so respect the neighborhood
Local house,Good place for photoshoot... but sometimes theres alot of visitor and its hard to take a good photo...
Great walk!,Nice walking around a traditional village with fantastic views over the city. Found many places you can rent the traditional clothing if you was with your wife so I would recommend this. Just respect locals by keeping the noise down as it is a residential area :)
A place for those interested in the past,A very beautiful place that presents the old architecture. Don't miss the artist-name difficult to remember- who has wonderful collection of his paintings-the swans and horses ; a few to remember.The people who live there even now get the credit of maintaining the past so meticulously. A wonderful place.
Be prepared to walk ,"Lots of walking here. It is actually a residential area and do keep silence around the houses. If you have the time, you can stop by the cafes or stay a night in the guest houses, which is pretty expensive as told by our guide. But it would be nice to experience living in hanbok. "
Old school Seoul - but too crowded with tourists,Love this place and its old school houses and the quaint of the surrounding. Good for a late afternoon walk which I did - but suggest for you to go early in the morning if you prefer quieter moment with less of a crowd and people appearing in your pictures from time to time. If you don't mind people appearing in your pictures then you can go anytime. But just 1-2 hours in this place should suffice. It's quite a small area I feel. :)
2nd best place to visit in Seoul!,"Bukchon is the ""old town"" of Seoul. It has preserved much of olden day Korea. From the nameless streets, to the grand doors and the old school Korean houses this neighborhood is legit. "
Traditional Korean houses,A charming place to visit and experience walking through traditional Korean houses in the neighbourhood but also very touristy. Do take note that this is a residential area so keep your volume down!
An area of old houses,"I would probably put this area near the middle or bottom of your list for places in Seoul. Yes, there are some nice old houses in a residential area lined with very narrow streets. The houses are on a hill so there are some nice views available, but it may require that you have a prerequisite good health to walk the hills. And because it is a residential area, there are numerous signs and people (dressed in traditional Korean garb) standing with signs asking tourists to keep their voices down.There are also some restaurants and shops on the outskirts which provide some shopping opportunities.However, the area really doesn't warrant a must-see status..."
A walk through time.,"The Bukchon neighborhood is a preservation of an old traditional Korean village. Bukchon is located in the north side between Cheonggyecheon and Jongmyo, hence the name Bukchon, which means the north village. You walk through alleyways that have these beautiful homes. I stopped at each house and looked at the beautiful architecture of the roof tops and the intricate carvings on the doors and walls. While we were walking we came across a home where a lovely young lady was waiting outside, eager to show us the house from the inside. The owners were away and allowed for their house to be shown. We gladly took the opportunity and paid her the 15,000 Korean Won ($12) per person for the tour. This was our chance to look at a traditional home from the inside. The huge door opened into a serene garden with bonsai trees and a little pond. Inside the house there was very little furniture but tranquility filled each room. I was thinking that clutter is what causes us so much stress but here there was none in this beautiful, serene, home. Note to self, get rid of clutter! At the end of the tour we were offered some homemade plum tea which we sipped while we gazed at the garden outside. Rejuvenated, we wandered about through the lanes and admired more houses from the outside. The Bukchon area is a ""must see"" and the bonus is that it it is within walking distance of the Gyeongbokgung Palace and the most famous shopping area of Insadong. The trick is to go to the tourist information center and get a good walking map because it is a bit tricky to find Bukchon. The area is also home to many small restaurants and coffee shops.  "
nice place nice people,"i went to this place with my friends at summer holiday, we waste some times to find this place because it is not very easy to find, so i suggest people should find some information from internet. I think the view is good and those building is special. There are so many stores which can rent some korea traditional clothing for people to take photo, but you should decide it carefuly, because some of it is expensive. We can feel the korea culture and the history at this place. We chage our clothes to korea traditional clothing and take a lot of photos at this place, the korea traditional clothing are very match with that environment. we feel like we are back in the korea old time, the feeling is interesting."
Little streets of heritage houses,"Bukchon Village is still a residential area and despite signs asking people to be quiet, many inconsiderate tourists still natter on at the top of their voices. Otherwise a quaint area with many houses still boasting the wooden beams and eaves that mark the architecture of a past era. A little bit of a hike through the hilly streets. Good to start with this before heading to Insadong"
หมู่บ้านวัฒนธรรม The cultural village,เป็นหมู่บ้านวัฒนธรรม ที่ยังคงรักษาสภาพอาคาร บ้านเรือน ในแบบดั้งเดิมไว้ได้อย่างดี สวยงาม มีจุดถ่ายภาพมากมาย เดินไกลนิด เหนื่อยหน่อย แต่ก็คุ้มThis is the cultural village that remain old style and beautiful. Although it's a long way for walking but valuable for photographer and most visitor.
Get a good pair of shoes!,"Yes, I found the place after walking around trying to find a road that went all the way up to the top of a hill. If you embark on this trail, you've better get a good pair of shoes, since this area is sort of hilly. The rooftops are as seen in many postcards. You can have a glance of the rooftops by visiting one of the houses that offer ""a good view"" for a drink, as I did since it was a drizzly day. The decorated doors are gorgeous. Many locals wearing traditional costumes also visit this area. "
Really Charming Korean Traditional Village,"Absolutely love it! A must place to go. As an architect, I really appreciate the traditional style of buildings which were built to perfection."
Good stroll to see the historic homes and neighborhood layout,Definitely pick up a map before you start that identifies the walking route. It's worth it. My highlight was when I stepped into the doll maker's house and was worth it to see her craft. I even bought three of her dolls since they were very reasonably priced. Every piece was unique. 
a unique enclave of Korean tradition 북촌한옥마을,"A top-10 must visit in Seoul, we visited it just after exploring nearby Insadong. Not quite a “Village” per sey, more a neighbhood area which houses 900 plus Hanoks or traditionally houses. Bukchon means 'northern village"", and some of these residence blocks are actually centuries-old of the Joseon Dynasty!Surrounded by a few very busy traffic streets the premise is quaint and picturesque, and surprisingly well integrated with its neighnourhood. It is modern meets traditional houses-architecture! Some of the Hanoks are still resident occupied while others were converted into chic galleries, restaurants, cafés and accessory shops. There are signs that remind all that being a residential area, one should not make excessive din. This area is visited by many tourists and you can see plenty of people donning the traditional costumes walking around taking photos (you can rent them ..). We stopped by the Bukchon Tourist Centre to check out more details of the area. There is also the Traditional Craft Experience Centre where host aa variety of cultural programs and activities. A rare opportunity for one to experience and immerse in Korean traditional culture indeed.We read from a blogger that there are actually “8 photo spots” where you can take the best pictures with the most picturesque background. We tried and found 3!! You should also. We thoroughly enjoy the meandering walk through Bukchon Hanok many small alleys and streets. Just note that it is on a slight hill so could be taxing for some. Remember to also walk to the top of the hill and take a stunning view of Seoul too.Throw away your maps and get literally “lost” in the charms of traditional hanok. Thoroughly enjoyable and experiential trip for me & wifey. We spent close to 3 hours before leaving via Line 3 Anguk Station."
Only place in Seoul to see traditional Korean housing,"This is a must see area to get a feel for how beautiful the Korean housing was in the era before then concrete and steel apartment building. It is easy to get to, is very walkable (although hilly) and has nice local shops with crafts and food. It has become popular with Chinese tour groups so best to go during the week vs, weekends."
"Charming Bukchon, old city neighborhood in Seoul, South Korea","The visit to this neighborhood was suggested by the visitor center. It has several small streets, old houses, and shops. It quite touristy and well kept. There are many food and souvenirs shopping options.There are a few employees of the visitor center who are in one of the streets and speak a little English. They will be able to give you information and directions. We needed to go to the shrine and they helped suggesting the quickest route to it."
Korean cultural village,Requires lots of walking up hills and downhills. Not suitable for elderly or children. The view is not bad. Visitors should wear proper shoes for this attraction. Sports shoes is highly recommended.
Short walks around Buchon,Walks here from my Hotel (Ibis Ambassador Insadong) only 15minutes. Went to information and asked about the location n maps around. Really like the old houses and salutes for korean that they still keep it and do the good maintenances to every houses. Wish to stay in one of the guest houses or hanok stay. Met some cute cafes along the alley and good pasta restaurant too can't took a good pic around the hanok since i went there in day time and so many people around. Recommended to come early in the morning to get a good pic
Quick Stop for photo-ops,"This is Just an alley to take good photos of the traditional Hanok village in Korea. Hanbok rental are also available for 10,000 krw. This is a beautiful place to Visit, You just have to be quiet because this is a residential area. Bukchon is 5-10 minutes walk to anguk station. Visit this place at Around 8-9AM because Group/bus of tourists usually arrives after this hour which makes it a little bit crowded."
Tasty fried pork and shrimp mundu,"A small restaurant located on a narrow side street of Insadong and one of our favorite place for lunch. Seemed like the dumplings, especially the shrimp dumpling, shrunk in size since our last 2 visits but they were still crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Beside the dumplings, the next best tasting dish was their kimchee. It was fresh tasting, not extremely spicy, and the saltiness of the cabbage was perfect to the taste. There were others eating cold and hot noodles which I would like to try on our next visit."
So nice,"We went there by accident and found out that it's one of attractions once we've been there.Amazing architecture, tiny, steep streets, beautiful roofing, wooden gates and little walls surrounding each house.We found one house open to a public free of charge. You really need to see this."
Low key and small,Very subdued old neighborhood where you can still see what Seoul used to look like before modernization. Takes about an hour to walk through it. It's nothing spectacular but a convenient location to add to your list of sightseeing if you're visiting the palaces nearby.
A great place to visit within residential area,"It is a great place to stroll if you want to know the Korean house that is actually with people living inside. It has a lot of walkings to do and the area is flooded with tourists in rented hanbok, so it makes you difficult to take some good photos as every corner you will bump into people."
don't skip the hanok museum,whatever your time constraint is please do not skip the hanok museum because it is as close as you can get to see how it looks like on the inside. unless you have the budget to book a hanok during your stay in seoul that is. otherwise this museum gives you a great detailed explainations of the hanok. the restaurants nearby here are good too.
Between ancient and modern korea,the hundreds year old houses nicely retained and still inhabitant. make sure be quiet and be polite while taking photo. Of cause surrounded by souvenir shops and cafe for tourists. 
Hanok experience,"Rented hanok & walk around the village. Makes you felt like a Korean. Hanok give us an impression it is heavy but after experiencing, weighted much more lighter than expected. Mistaken as Korean & had some pictures taken with other tourists. "
Nice stroll through restored hanok houses,Walking through Bukchon Village is a great experience. You will get to see many different Hanok houses that have been restored as well as getting stunning views of both the Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung palaces. End the visit climbing down the stone staircase into Samcheong dong.
"Beautiful, Worth of walk","Visit Bukchon, Hanok village require a lot of walk, but the old style houses are very beautiful, you must come walk a afternoon when you visit Seoul!"
Very nice little village,Absolutely enjoyed the walk in this small village.. there were a lot of people and we were lucky enough that it was hanbok festival so there were plenty of people in hanbok.. This is a must visit and i recommend that you try to go on the hanbok festival..
Interesting Village,We had a wonderful time exploring this village! Quaint & insightful. Highly recommended. Will come back again!
Great neighbourhood to walk round!,"I took the metro to Anguk and took exit 2. Heading up the road there are some quaint side streets and coffee shops/cafes that align the road. I managed to pick up a free guide of the area from a stand that had a useful map and a basic route that allows you to circle round the area going up hill area to the main area where the streets are lined with traditional Hanok houses.It's good to take your time and enjoy the area generally. The walk up the hill isn't too onerous and there are plenty of opportunities to take photos. There are quite a lot of people wandering around seeing the houses so be patient if you want to take photos as most people walk along the same route. As the houses are actual residences there are many signs asking people to not be too loud and be respectful. Some houses were open for visitors for a fee however I didn't take that option.The route down from the hill also presents itself with many opportunities for those who like to shop. There are also a large number of quaint and traditional looking tea houses plus the more modern coffee houses so take you time, wander the streets and sit down for a drink if you want to rest up!"
Fantastic area to visit and stay in Seoul,This area is fantastic to wander around in. The village is nice to see and there are many great little shops and quaint cafes.We stayed one night and liked it so much we changed our hotel booking to stay another night. Definitely try staying in a traditional hanok for the night!
Fantastic architectures..,"Very unique design of hanoks.. and there are also boutiques for sourv. And local foods to taste.. there are also ""points to see"" for good scenenaries of bukchon.."
Korean Traditional Village,Beautiful Korean traditional house. Walking distance from Insadong. Uphill location so be prepared to walk. Must see place.
"Interesting but for us, it wasn't as interesting as we expected","It is fun to stroll through the narrow streets and see the numerous old hanok houses. It was fairly crowded with tourists, both Korean and others. We especially enjoyed seeing the many local people dressed in traditional Korean clothing who come here to be photographed. "
Nice architectural ,It's eye opener to walk along the bukchon street. Basically it's a mix of commercial and residential. The architecture of the houses are very unique. There were even guest houses in this area. Very interesting place. 
A taste of Korean Lifestyle and House,Walking through the streets of Bukchon will give one an insights into the culture of Koreans. The traditional houses and streets that are still homes to Koreans makes it an interesting experience for tourist. 
Traditional Korean houses,The area used to be a quiet residential area with traditional Korean houses but then became a main tourist attraction that was always overcrowded with visitors. It was full of people when we went there in late afternoon. Some men holding signs that reminded tourists to keep quiet were found in various spots where most people gathered and took pictures. We followed the crowd to walk uphill for about 20 minutes and found a side street where most Korean houses were located. Warning was found on the main door of some houses stating that no pictures were allowed. I felt sorry for the residents there but it was really the best place to see the real traditional Korean houses.
interesting and good views,perched in the hills this area is quieter than insadong but more intersting cafes ( traditional style)
Nice,"It's a very nice place especially if you wanted to see some filming locations, and old houses. We went in here for a morning walk and it was great, there were also travel guide posts during that time which helped us find our way"
Good for a couple of hours stroll,"A nice place to take a stroll and view the traditional Korean houses. The area is much smaller than expected, but do be prepared for a lot China tourists with cameras.You can get an area map from the Tourist Information Booth along the main road."
Quaint streets with pretty hanoks,Very pretty street with loads of quaint cafes and shops along the way. A must visit when you are in Seoul! 
Must go to for the Historical feel,"I was amazed by the beautiful old Korean houses in this small village. This is a famous tourist attraction so there were a lot of people. This is an uphill location so prepare yourself in walking with some effort going up and down. Don't worry if you get hungry, there are food places located in the village or you can go to, just a few blocks away, Insadong, another famous tourist shopping destination."
Disappointed,"This part/place was recommended by friends, but when we went there it was truly underwhelming at best. The two different areas are lined with traditional houses (Hanoak), but the area is not well marked, and many of these ""homes"" are commercial B&B/AirBB, tea house, etc. Still, it's a worth a visit just to walk around and take some pictures. "
Nice little village,It's a bit of an uphill walk coming from samcheongdong. It's a very small village with hanok style houses. A bit of Korean culture in the metropolis.
Very nice place but please keep the Volumes down.,Very nice houses around. Many handicraft shops and cafe around. Very relaxing place. There will be people there to make sure tourist to keep the volumes down as not to disturb the people staying there. Very nice experience and culture exposure. Very traditional place.
Bukchon is a must! ,Very nice and quaint area in Seoul. You will see locals walking around in their national costume. It's filled with unique shops which offer Korean products. Great places to eat or just to have dessert. 
Wandering aimlessly & delightfully,A bit overloaded with tourists-nonetheless quaint! It really doesn't photograph well-not sure why! Lots of coffee shops(coffee v expensive in Korea & weekly American!) to laze in-often with no nibbles! And craft shops & workshops where you can drop in for an hour and play
Awesome Area,"I recently visited Seoul with my husband and 4 month old baby. We stayed in a traditional hanok in the Bukchon area on our first night and loved it so much we cancelled our accommodation closer to town and stayed on in an airbnb. Loved the area, great cafes, restaurants, galleries and shops. Easy to walk to streets, easy access to the palaces and also the subway for anywhere else. Would highly recommend. "
Lovely place,Beautiful old buildings not far away from the big scyscrapers quite unusual combination. You can stroll on and quietly admire the old Seoul not paying for it. Its very close to the two biggest palaces so it may be an idea to combine these 3 things together in one day trip.
Nothing interesting,"The place is a residential area. Nothing new and interesting to see. Going up the street is very tiring because it's hilly and you won't see anything extra ordinary at all. However, the shops along the street, going to Bukchon, is pretty nice. That's where we bought and sent postcards for ourselves back home. =)"
Nice traditional scaled neighbourhood,"I did a self-guided walk, having picked up a may fro the local TI storefront. It was an enjoyable afternoon and was a nice reprieve from the hustle and bustle of central Seoul."
Please be quiet when you are there,It's a nice quaint place. Lots of walking. Uphill and downhill. Wear something comfy. Please be quiet as it is a residential place. Too many tourists who are quite rowdy and loud. Feel sorry for the residence there.
Absolutely lovely architecture in a quaint neighborhood,"Once you get to this area, just start following the signs and climb the stairs to get to the beautiful traditional Korean homes. This is a neighborhood of many private homes admidst modern day Seoul. There is one particular spot where you can take a pic of the traditional homes in the foreground and the skyscrapers and the N Seoul tower in the background.Tip: on the weekend, many Koreans dress in traditional garb and use this area as a backdrop for their pictures. So, you get a bonus having them in your own pictures!!"
Piece of the past in the modern city,Nice area in historical part of the city with old fashion/traditional style Korean houses. There is suppose to be several highlighted view points but streets looks very similar and i am still not sure if we actually found the right spots. Can be crowded with tourist (in this case just check the parallel streets). Anyway it is worth to see it once you are next to the palaces. Btw it is not a museum and people are still leaving there.
Pretty but too crowded,"Tons of tourists rent hanboks and run around taking their photos. So it was full of Chinese tourists who were eager for their photo ops. They didn't care too much if you were standing around waiting for them to move on, so you need to be a bit assertive if you want your own picture. Nonetheless it was nice that they did have some businesses opened to teach you about their culture and crafts. It was also awesome that the red uniform friendly welcome team were nearby to give directions. It saved me from walking straight up the hill to nowhere. Although the climb was steep, to finally walk down on the other side into Samcheong Dong, it was rewarding to find tons of cute cafes and churros stores at the bottom of the hill. The churro/ice cream was welcoming. I'd go again, not in 30 degrees weather, and hopefully not during Korea Fest month (open mad tourist season)."
Disappointed,"The houses are now residences so tourists are advised to stay silent while walking through the village. There's nothing to see but old wooden doors and walls. We cant even see what a typical old house looked like inside. There were some quaint artshops and cafes but other than that, nothing special. They had lots of volunteer tour guides who will help you find your way."
Definitely worth the walk! Must do!,"Bukchon village is definitely worth the walk, experience the real traditional Korean houses and on the top of the hill you will have a great view! "
Beautiful houses and view,"This is one of the few places I went to twice. Not that I did not want to see the other places again but the first time I went here was around 10am, so quite early. But it was a LOT of tourists. And at least 5 BIG groups of chinese tourists. And they wanted just like me to take a lot of photos. But it was impossible to get decent photos with so many ppl around. So me and my friend decided to go back the next day, but at 7am instead. We were still not alone but I got so much better photos. So I recommend going here before breakfast if possible. The place/area itself then. Such a beautiful place with traditional buildings. The Hanok village is situated on top of a hill Sotheby's view from there as well is really stunning.Be sure not to miss out on this great place!"
Nostalgic charm with a modern twist,"Get a map from the tourist information centre which is a short walk from the Anguk subway station (exit 2). This map shows the main points of interest and different walking routes. The traditional architecture of the hanok village makes for an interesting stroll for an hour or two. Just be prepared to deal with busloads of rowdy mainland tourists jostling to snap pictures and some pretty steep hills. Comfortable shoes are a good idea.Some of the converted hanoks house galleries and shops. A few hanoks are open to the public for a fee. Pop into Granhand (19 Bukchon-ro 11-gil), a shop which sells contemporary, made-in-Korea fragrances, diffusers, sachets, linen sprays and candles in ceramic containers shaped like kimchi pots and traditional vessels. The artisanal scents are named after famous people like anthropologist Jane Goodall and furniture designer Finn Juhl. The bottle labels can be hand stamped with your name or the recipient's name and packed in jute bags. Great service from the friendly English-speaking staff. The shop entrance is discreet and might be easily overlooked. Combine Bukchon with Gyeongbokgung (one of the royal palaces) and Insadong (local flavour, dining and shopping) to make the most of a full day itinerary. They are one or two subway stops away from one another."
A nice place to walk around!,"This part of the city is beautiful. It's has a nice feel where the old city meets new with many interesting vintage shops to look around. There are many galleries and small snack stand to get cinnamon flat bun and spicy rice cake dukbokki. We tried two restaurants there. One was hanjunsik and the other one was a steak/fries place. Don't believe the hype. They weren't that good. The food was overpriced and there were not worth paying that price. Try getting food at insadong. But if you like cafes, it's definitely a nice place to relax and read a book. And yes, a great place to take photos as well. It's very picturesque. "
Nice to see,"Took a while for us to walk here and find the place. Although it was awesome to see, it wasn't as much of as experience as I was hoping. There are a lot of people all on one road and you can't be loud, as it is still a residential area. But go and see it, it's a nice area to just hang around in! "
Very Nice Architectural Buildings,"This place is now a residential area and very few were converted to art galleries, restaurant, retail and museums. So u can see lots of signages to request for silence as the residences do not want to be disturbed. Lanes were narrow and we can only see the exterior as all homes were locked. Maybe an hour is good enough as they were unique to Korean culture but almost all the same with little variations. "
nice stroll and small alleys,it is nice stroll amongst the small alleys with the little shops. there's one part where you get nice sunset view with roofs of the old houses as foreground for your photos. but please please bring down your voice level as it is actual residence.
Nice,You walk around the old houses with a lot of people to try to put the best pictures.Beautiful view from the top
Quint neighborhood popular with tourists,"This is quite an interesting ""old but new"" living place in Seoul, right between Changdeok & Gyeongbok palaces. It is a live neighborhood brimming with tourists (must be painful or exciting for the residents depending upon their outlook and attitude) totting their cameras and eager to take their selfies at every corner. The narrow alleys and the hilly terrain, along with the traditional walls, roofs and doors make up for a very nice stroll to spend anywhere from 30 minutes to hours. Do visit it, but realize that it is a refurbished community, so it has a somewhat of a touristic feel to it."
Must-Visit,"Bukchon is a must-visit when in Seoul, as you can get to see the traditional houses of South Koreans. Do lower your volumes when you visit as they are residential places. You can take really great photos here, especially when dressed in Hanbok."
My Seoul trip,"A collection of traditional hanok houses in one area.The nearest subway station is Anguk (line 3 orange line). My suggestion would be to plan visiting Insadong,Gyeongbokgung palace and Bukcoh all on the same day as they are all in the same area.Be prepared to walk a lot. Before you get to Bukchon, get an area map from the tourist information center ( the is one near the entrance of Insadong street, not far from the Anguk station). This map will show the side streets where most of the hanok houses are located.Mind you, some of them are on a steep hill.Wear comfortable clothing and shoes, otherwise you may not enjoy this at all.Always carry a bottle of water with you.If you are not a history buff and you have only limited days in Seoul, I would suggest that you can avoid the palaces and the Hanok village."
So traditional,Love the design of traditional house in this area. So peaceful and full of tradition. Located near Gwanghwamun
Explore the 8 Major scenes as your mission!,"You can serve Bukchon as an maze request game. First, head to the tourist information counter to take a full map of Bukchon. Then, started to fullfill the request to view all the 8 legendary scenes. After that, once you are successfully, reward yourself with a coffee at Sam cheong dong which is beside Bukchon. Perfect i should say!At the end i am sure you have explored Bukchon upside down! p/s: Scene 5 , 6 , 7 is crowded with a lot of people. It is harder to take a non people picture."
Must visit !,Lovely quaint neighborhood to stroll around. It is touristy for sure but local residences as well. Be brave to venture into the traditional tea houses and little restaurants tucked into alleys. They are a gem. 
Beautiful area.,"A great area to walk and see all the wonderful architecture up close. With respect to the people that live here, you can walk up and down the streets in this beautiful neighborhood.There are many shops & nice restaurants close by."
Bukchon Hanok Village,I still like the place very much as one can just wander around and relax here. Me and my friend also got to join some activities there like wearing hanbok and making the traditional korean hair band which was quite fun.Although there might not much to do but Ill still recommend one to visit to take a look at this side of Korea and maybe join some of the activities there as well!:)
Unique,Unique residences and alleys. Great for photography and long walks. Do wear good walking shoes as there were lots of slopes.
北村韩屋村有着街道博物馆的美誉!,"Good experience to adore Korean old days architecture! Like a street museum. Well maintenance also! There is a food street here where you can get a lot of local foods, remember to explore it! "
Quaint and Quiet,Korean traditional houses surely are interesting. Seeing them one by one and comparing the houses is fun. Like the fact that they are all well preserved since it's a part of the Korean history.Worth a visit.
Nice walk to explore the old style korean house.,"At the back, there is a nice backdrop for pictures. Alot of photo opportunities there. A nice friendly old lady selling nice postcards there. Do buy from her."
A must visit site,"Easy to walk to or take the metro. Very historical but somewhat taken over by corporations and shops. Still, lots of history and architecture. Bring some good walking shoes as some of the streets are steep"
Great look into the past,"It's really cool to be able to walk through a neighborhood straight from the Korean past. These old homes are preserved from before the modern age and show how the Koreans used to live before Western influences. At first, I was annoyed by all the older ladies walking around trying to keep everyone silent, but after seeing how some of the tourists acted there, I could see why. Remember, people actually live here so try to remain quite."
Unique buildings and streets,"Walking around in Bukchon village could be quite fun especially for those who like to have a feel of the environment and atmosphere. U can also choose to wear the ""hanbok"" and taking pictures around this area."
"It's a good walk, but...",There's hardly anything much else to do. Lots of closed doors and security locks. Just make sure you have the legs for the rolling roads.
Beautiful & nice place,"A must visit place for first time traveler in Seoul. We spend around 2 hours here. A quick tip is try to go here by noon, where it's less crowded then you will have a perfect picture to show to your friend :)"
Beautiful village,"You will get lost in this area, forget the time, forget where you are. Wandering around the village is a beautiful memory."
Wonderful historic part of Seoul,Lots of old-style houses and shops on very narrow and hilly streets; make sure you get the map of the neighborhood at the Bukchon Heritage Center.
"Beautiful, tranquil neighbourhood.","Walking around this area of traditional Korean housing is simply delightful: it's well preserved and maintained. I thoroughly recommend getting off the main streets too as it's a lot less busy and there are little exhibitions, temples and shops to discover."
Old elite residence,Easily access via subway ( Angguk station). Keep your voice lower to respect the residence. No entrance fee was charged. One of the korean drama shooting location.
Lovely to walk around and see the authentic village,"This was a great experience that I highly recommend!You walk around the old village, around the houses and find yourself in a different world. The small village is less busy and more authentic than the larger village but both are worth a visit!"
Buchon,Authentic Korea. Beautiful village. Very quiet place to appreciate history. Some local shops and restaurants available
Beautiful and authentic,Visiting Bukchon Hanok Village is a must-do when visiting Seoul. The area is beautiful and even if there are many tourists it's still lovely to take a walk and see the traditional houses and streets. Try to get lost on the side streets and discover areas not so crowded. There are many cafes and restaurants in the area.
Shopping in the traditional Korean residence district,"Once you have visited Gyrongbok palace, consider walking toward Bukchon which literally mens Northern Town. It is full of small shops and eateries with the glimpse of home stay in a traditional Korean housing. In the house stay, there are no beds. Instead, a floor is provided much like when one goes to camping but more luxurious and comfortable way. I did not stay but walked into a house to get information. "
Hipster Heaven!,Lovely little suburb to walk through where tradition and modernity merge. So many interesting shops and cafes to explore and definitely worth a visit!
Such a beautiful neighborhood,"The first time i went to Bukchon Hanok Village i was so exited. From what i know from internet it's a place that you can see a traditional korean house, and indeed it is a nice place to walk around and take pictures. You can also find small restaurant in this neighborhood with a korean traditional interior."
old building,"I like this place very much, you can walk slowing to feel what people live here from the passmany small shop for food and for clothing. spend one day here is worth...."
Fun to look around the tiny streets. ,Had a good time roaming the streets of Bukchon. Took awhile to find it but once we did had good time. If you enjoy old architecture this is for you. 
Samcheong-dong,"there were lot of cafes and small places to shop, and you can get to the Bukchon Vallage (Korean traditional houses) they are very nice, and people are living in them. there were a lot of people rented the traditional outfit and walk around - cute & fun!"
Interesting,"This place was quite nice and the old buildings were beautiful. However, I'm not sure if it's because I had high expectations or something, but that was about it. There wasn't too much. There weren't any houses open to the public to see (at least not where we went). It's also not that big. "
Keeping tradition,"In the middle of bustling modern Seoul, some people elect to live in traditional houses in traditional surroundings. Well worth a stroll (1-2 hours)"
Watch out for the bikes and cars!,"Take a map, it can get a little confising! Lots of old style buildings alongside the new. Take a hat and prepare to spend a few hrs on foot :)"
Beautiful,Wonderful place.If you go during the week it should be quiet and peaceful. I thought it would only be a few streets but actually the area is fairly big with lots and lots of hank houses to take pictures of.The view from higher ground are also excellent.
Underwhelming,"Not quiet what I expected. The houses looked nice but that's about it really. Also didn't help that it can get very crowded being a tourist destination, making the whole experience a bit underwhelming. If you're close to the area then go for it but I wouldn't go out of my way for this one. "
Wander and wander,"This was a fantastic neighborhood to simply get yourself lost and wander up and down the streets. In my opinion, it's the best way to travel. Please be mindful of your voice level to respect the people who live in this neighborhood. Most of the people who were visiting this area were loud and obnoxious with their selfie sticks. There are signs everywhere reminding all who are visiting the to keep their voices at a minimum. Just outside this residential area are little streets with shops, art galleries, restaurants and cafes. This is also a great place to explore. "
Nice traditional village near the Gyeongbokgung,"very excited to find out about the traditional village near Gyeongbokgung. It's like time capsule going back to Joseun dynasty. Enjoy strolling at the village, feel peaceful here."
Beautiful village showcasing old and new Korea.,"Nice place to visit. Be prepared to spend a few hours there. A lot of walking is needed as you need to walk up a sloppy road leading to the village. On the way the road is lined with trees and beautiful scenery below and from afar. A lot of art work can be seen everywhere. The houses are mostly traditional Korean houses though some are renovated and look new. There are residents living in those houses , thus it is advisible not to talk too loud or disturb them. Good place to take photos. Not many seats are available for you to sit and rest but there are cafes around for you to relax and drink.You can even rent the traditional Korean dress ( hanbok ) for photo taking."
cute streets but not much happening,"Picturesque little streets filled with restaurants, tea houses a a few shops. Nothing special apart from a nice stroll. Not far away from the city centre. "
Interesting mix of old and new,"Great area to wander around. Go off the main roads and get yourself lost a little, you'll easily find your way back. Plenty of cafés and places to eat. It's very popular, so be prepared for plenty of company, particularly at weekends. Lots of couples in traditional hanbok dress add to the atmosphere and the views of the old hanok houses against the background of high rise modern Seoul are fabulous.Walking out of Bukchon, you're only a stones throw from Insa-dong. "
beautiful village,"The Hanok Village in Bukchon is Korean traditional houses. It is famous and one of must go to visit attractions in Korea. The Hanok Village is on the top of the mountain, so you need to walk a long and steap road. Although you will feel tired, it is worth when you arrived at the Hanok Village. A lot of tourists dressed Korean traditional clothes – Hanbok, they took pictures in this beautiful places like a Korean. I am regret that I did not rent hanbok to try. It will a good experience. Also, I saw a foreign TV show came to there. They introduced the Hanok Village and interviewed the local resident to introduce the history of the village. Walking along this road, you found the air is fresh and the hanok is total different from each other. Each house have their feature and culture. I really recommend this place to take a visit in Seoul. However, our voice should as low as possible. We should not disturb the local residents."
Just go there and wander,"Lovely village. You can't miss it. Just wander around the winding streets that some times turn into sidewalks that can end up as stairs. Don't worry if you end up in a dead end, just turn around and find another path. Charming area with innumerable cafes and tea houses on the main street. Do make sure you get off the main street, though."
Beautiful area,Really nice to walk through these picturesque alleys with its nice little homes. But it can be quite busy there with tourists taking selfies everywhere and not even respecting the property of the people living there. 
Bukchon Hanok Village,Had a little walk around here during the day. Very lovely but quiet busy. You can use the hop on hop off bus to get here which we did. There is also a lovely park surrounding which was nice to walk through. Good examples of olden style dwellings - there were written information plaques but I do not recall English - though I may be incorrect.
a glimpse of traditional Korean house,Be prepared to walk up and downhill when you tour around this area.It is quiet and you can have a glimpse of the traditional Korean house.
Perfect mix of a modern and traditional taste,"What I found interesting is, this village is located in the city, integrated with other element of the city. It is surprising when you walk in the pavement with a busy traffic and the next turn you take bring you to the traditional taste of Korean home.I learned that this area is visited by tourist massively, but I was there late afternoon so I only encounter 2-3 people, which is amazing. This is basically a residential area, so you should respect them and keep your voice low."
The greatest village in Seoul,"Traveller MUST visit this village. Very unique and traditional place of Seoul. I love every minute in this place, feel very tranquility and calming "
Beautiful and full of tourists,Very beautiful area that's full of tourists. Nice area with great views. Be prepared for the tourist crowds
Picturesque,"Quaint and picturesque traditional village. Plenty of people rent the traditional costumes and walk around taking photos. Rather crowded but fun to wander around. There are several museums around, apparently, offering insights into the cultural background. Do remember that this is still a residential area, so they request tourists to keep their voices down."
Traditional korean houses village," If you want to see how korean traditional houses & village looks like, you visit here bukchon Hanok village. There are over 900 houses packed. "
Memorable Lane,It's like going back to the past with all the older yet very well maintained homes of Korea. great street to visit!
Traditional residential area of Seoul,"This cluster of traditional Korean houses is located between the Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung palaces. Bukchon literally means 'northern village"". Some of these residence blocks are centuries-old. The Bukchon Traditional Culture Centre located in this area plans and operates a variety of cultural programs. A walk through Bukchon Hanok essentially means a walk through meandering alleys. Thoroughly enjoyable and pretty!"
Not what we expected... so much better,"We visited the village early morning as a stop gap whilst waiting to start our Secret Garden Tour at Changdeokgung Palace. So glad we decided to stop by as it's such a gem. Not at all what we were expecting, but so much better, a great mix of old and new. Great little shops and cafes, had some nice restaurants too. Just a shame we didn't have more time.....Would definitely visit again, would just make sure we made more time. Lovely way to spend a couple of hours."
Lovely place full of hidden gems,We had a lovely couple of hours walking round all the hidden little streets.Some good shops and very reasonable priced.
Disappoiting place,"I've heard so much positive about this place but when i arrived there it wasnt much. Its basically just a hill with traditional buildings. It's worth taking a visit when doing Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palace since its between those two, but do not plan to spend much time here."
The Way that it Used to Be,"Take the time to visit the ""old Seoul."" High atop hills, with a great view of the city, you can wander up and town narrow streets, looking at old home and buildings of the ancient architecture. A MUST SEE!"
Residential area,We asked directions at the tourist information booth and was given a map of Bukchon where he highlighted the best places to go. On arrival at the village there was a coach tour getting off so it can get busy as it is a popular tourist site. There are many signs telling people to keep the noise down as this is a residential area. However this did not stop people talking loudly or posing for photos on the doorway of someone's house. The village mixes the old traditional houses with some newer style. I felt like I was intruding into their neighbourhood and they must get pretty tired of the tourists gawping in and taking photos of their houses. The only people that seem to benefit are the shops selling gifts and the cafes and restaurants. 
overrated but the shopping is fun,"The area of Seoul is lovely - and unique. Most of Seoul is in the process off renovation and Bukchon still has some of the old feel to it. Jump into the alleys for proper food. If someone is beckoning you into a hole in the wall sort of restaurant, go in. You will be in the right place. The pictures on the wall will assist you in choosing something to eat and you will love it. Best food anywhere"
Charming sort of old area,By sort of old I meant a little more than 100 years old. That in the scheme of things not really old but still a nice hour of walking and some shops
If you don´t do anything else; do this,"We LOVED it! If you do not see anything else in Seoul this is definitely something to do. The feeling, the little shops, the beautiful streets... so sweet in the middle of the city. Do this. Short but sweet."
Love it,If you visit korea you cant miss this place i stay 2 night here and to me is not enough i wish i have more time 
Great atmosphere,"I really liked the atmosphere of the ""village"", it's quite calm compared to downtown Seoul. Really pretty."
A Walk in Korean Traditional Village during a Rainy Day,"Bukchon Hanok Village is within walking distance from Anguk Station. If you are unsure about the layout of the village, I would recommend you to visit the tourist information center located along the way from Anguk Station to the village. The staff there will provide you with the village map and even will advise on the suitable route to enjoy the walk. I visited this village during a windy and rainy day. Even though our visit was somehow affected by the strong wind and wet clothes, but as it was just a leisure walk, we still able to enjoy the walk and took memorable pictures. The whole village is residential area with people living inside the traditional house, so we have to mind our manners and avoid making loud sounds. There are a lot of picturesque spots throughout the village. If you enjoy leisure walk and traditional architectures, this is a must visit area. In addition, Buckhon Hanok Village is near to Gyeongbukgong Palace and if you don't mind to walk for another 10 mins plus, you can just walk to the palace from this village."
Join a Walking Tour,The Hanuk Village in Bukchon is absolutely picturesque. The village successfully preserves the humble yet intricate architecture of traditional Korean houses. The road is steep so wear comfortable footwear! I also suggest joining a walking tour instead of a DYI so as not to unnecessarily waste any time and effort in getting lost.
Cute little traditional street,"Very easy to do a little walk about here, streets connect to lots of little restaurants and then you are close to the Palace to so that after."
Step back in time,Great place to visit to see the traditional building styles and methods of yesterday. Its a relatively small spot so it won't take long to see a lot. Keep in mind this is a residential neighborhood and apparently the residents are not huge fans of the crowds. You'll see a lot of people here taking pictures.
Absolutely an amazing experience!,"You can choose to go with a tour or like me - walking free and easy! It is a great area full of hanoks (traditional korean houses), boutique shops and cafe. I was planning to spend half a day but turned out enjoyed for a good 5-6 hours walk with breaks in between. It was great to take a break with some ice tea and Korean snacks in a hanoks cafe.For photography lovers, you may take more than half a day like me. It was great walking round to take photos along small alleys, definitely a great trip! I enjoyed getting lost in the village although I had a map with me. For those who love to stay in old houses, there are lots of guest houses too For the cafe lover, absolutely a place to go with traditional atmosphere with some Korean tea and snacks.For those who go with tours, please lower your voice because this is still a residential area with residents. Unfortunately many tourists were still making lots of noises - even the tour guides were loud, not exactly respecting the residents. Tips: Please visit early and plan for your route if you want to avoid the crowds, I managed to avoid it.Also, you may want to bring/ purchase electronic fan if you travel during Summer like me."
Love it,Many traditional house (hanok) in there. We can also try street food in some stores. Little bit crowded but not a problem
Nyx,"2 years ago, I tried to come here from Samcheongdong and omg it was so steep. This time I tried from Insadong/Anguk stn and it was so easy. Get out from exit2, wait for the green bus no.2 at the stop across the street from Starbucks and get off at 북촌한옥마을.돈미약국 (Bukchon Hanok Village/Donmi pharmacy) to save 10 mins of walking up the hill. From the stop, cross the street and just follow the crowd. From the photospot no. 4(if I remembered correctly) which is the observation point, you can walk down to Samcheongdong using steep staircase or the not too steep/far walkway. After that you can roam around the street. if you turn right you will shortly arrive at Kyeongbok Palace. If it's too much of a walk, after you reach the ground, just cross the street and take the bus to the palace or the main road for subway stn."
Very interesting,"If you are interested in getting ""lost"" in a folk area in Seoul, Bukchon Hanok village is a good chance to do it. You can see how a Korean village did look like, how the ceilings are/were made, the entrance doors of the houses and so on. I would recommend to visit the ""sample"" of old house shown in the Bukchon Traditional Culture Center."
See old Seoul.,"I highly recommend this neighborhood. This is the only neighborhood in Seoul where you can see traditional Korean houses. Some of the traditional houses have been turned into art galleries, coffee shops and museums where you can experience traditional Korean culture (tea ceremony, arts and crafts, etc.)"
Must see!,"Bukchon Hanok village is a must see while in Seoul. Easy to get to and fascinating to walk around. I wouldn't spend a lot of time here but it is worth seeking out - just do it quietly, the locals who live there don't appreciate noisy tourists!"
See cultural houses,"Go here if you're interested in their cultural houses. There's a lot of walking and there are steep areas that at some point, my parents would just wait for us instead of walk all the way up the kinda steep walkway. It was a nice walk along the houses. It can also be considered a fun mini hike if you're up for that kind of stuff. The view of the sunset and mountain is beautiful from here."
Too many tourists on a Sunday,"I had high expectations of walking around quiet neighborhoods of hanoks which are traditional Korean wooden homes. My husband and I went on a Sunday. The streets were overrun with tourists taking photos of themselves with the homes in the backgrounds. You'll need to walk uphill to see the more interesting homes. The tiny Bukchon Tourist Office provides a good map and lots of helpful information. Go on a quiet week day. Hopefully, it will feel more authentic."
Nice views plus bought local clothes,"I enjoyed walking and taking photos ans also bought local traditional cloths for around 20 000 for myself and the same for my wife. Children version cost 15 000. Also enjoyed fried rice with hit sauce, and rice drink! "
Beautiful Korean traditional village. good for taking photo,"If you like taking picture, or you interested in Korean traditional houses, you won't disappointed. You can see a different ""Seoul"" from here, The village is quite big, you can walk up and down hill, to take a pictures. one thing I was not impress, is too many tourists, can not take a good photo with no people."
Quaint Traditional Neighbourhood,"I visited this area once in the summer and again during Chuseok in the autumn with family. It is a lovely and interesting neighbourhood to walk around.Although it is easy to get to, you must keep in mind that it is all uphill. This can be difficult for anyone with a bad knee or anyone pushing a baby stroller.It's also a short activity (perhaps an hour max of looking around) so it would be worth going to the palace nearby to make a nice day of it all. There are many cafes and shops nearby for refreshments too."
Old Town of Seoul,"When you come to Seoul, Buchon Village is the little place that really traditional and if you love korean drama, this place is really like location for Korean Drama. But please do not make a noisy since this village still home for korean citizen. "
Interesting area to walk around,A glimpse into village life. Would have liked to have a look into more homes beyond the gates. They look quite spacious. Interesting exploring the alleys and shops. Good craft beer cafe to finish the visit.
Convenient location to see traditional Hanok houses,"Great walking tour between two of the major palace attractions, so a great way to get your hanok fix. The houses are well maintained and there is a small visitor center (Seoul Hanok Center) that can provide a map showing walking tour ideas and an extremely knowledegable and friendly guide who can provide more information and show you an unoccupied hanok and talk about some principles of it's construction. It is not listed on Trip Advisor but is right off of Gyedong-gil-2 streetThere is a lot of uphill climbing. Many cute little shops and some restaurants as well as micro museums within given hanoks."
Beautiful photo spot where traditional Korea meets modern Seoul,"This is a very relaxing attraction where you can walk streets to see old traditional Korean houses. They were very well maintained. As you walk up the hill, the Seoul skyline begins to emerge in the background. This is a great photo spot!There were two helpful ""information"" givers, who provided maps of the area and spoke great English! The whole attraction took us about an hour. Signs throughout remind visitors that Bukchon is a residential area, so keep your voices quiet.Check this out if you like beautiful architecture and scenery. Probably not the #1 Seoul attraction, but definitely a cute spot to visit!"
Well preserved traditional Korean living area,"This is definitely worth to visit. I don't expect these traditional Korean buildings are preserved so well. When walking along all the lanes of this area, I felt history is around me. Also, there are few shops to on those beautiful traditional clothing and took beautiful shot with the background of old Korean building. So happy! Of course, suggest to go there during weekday because it is a very popular sport for tourist."
Disappointed!,Nothing special at the place except for korea traditional houses. Namsamgol hanok village still the best i visited at seoul.
Rich of history,I love the structures of Korean houses here. I wish i can spend my night at least once in one of the houses here. 
"Quirky area, nice walk","Lovely walk around this area. Cool buildings, nice doors. Cute shops some galleries, a private observatory which we didn't go to. Some nice photo opportunities. Busy with other people taking selfies and generally getting in the way. Nice place, I think the people who live there must get really annoyed with tourists, from the signs on the walls and doors telling others to be quite etc."
Just walk around and enjoy,This place is so cute! Loved every corner! Walk in the middle of residential area and next there are more streets full of shops and small restaurants. Very nice.
Flash from the past,Is near Sophia guesthouse I look around nice village town. A lot shops to look around. Night time is the best to shop around.
Alley-way Photo,Again another place to get that Hanbok on! There's one alleyway that has great houses. resto not so good but tourist info people always ready to assist!
Prepare your walking shoes for some cardio challenge...,"The traditional houses in Bukchon are beautiful and you would encounter small shops selling trinkets and restaurants offering local delicacies. However, take note that you would do a lot of uphill and downhill walks around here which may not be recommended for old people and with health issues. P.S. Bring a bottle of water. Trust me, you'll get tired from all of that walking."
Very nice and lovely place in the midst of mixed residential and commercial village!,"After visiting the Changdeokgung palace (please refer to my earlier review of this place as well) as part of our full day city tour, which is just a short drive away from here, our guide brought us here for a short walkabout to immerse in another different aspects of the Korean culture and lifestyle.It was about 10.45am when we arrived and the weather warm and sunny. There is a small road with shophouses located on both sides of it (i.e. cafes, restaurants, retail and souvenir shops etc), and according to our guide, this place is very famous among the Japanese tourists, possibly because they are the ones who help to spur ""tourism"" activity here and true enough, in our walk around here, we saw many groups of Japanese tourists.As we walked deeper into the small road and into the lane where houses are located (of which some have been converted to retail and business operations). The walk was uphill on stone and rocky pathways. The houses here were very nice and lovely that depicted their long past history (of course some have been reconstructed or rebuilt and one do need to pay to admit). Most of the houses were well maintained and one could easily experience the Korean's enriching culture and history.As we walked higher (actually the walking trail was a full circle walk uphill and downhill and back to where we started), we saw more houses, unique shop houses, hostels and they were very beautifully decorated with flowers. When we reached the highest point, we did have a good bird eye's view on the vicinity and could even see the palaces from here, besides the mountains!It's a worthwhile visit here definitely as one could immerse in the unique ambience of the lovely Hanok Village of the past in present time. Although the walk can be challenging for some (at certain section, it was quite steep), just take your own sweet time and pace and you will still be able to complete the walk and see lovely things. If my 80-year old mum can do so, everyone can too!However, do take note of the following to make your walking trail fun and enjoyable:Do wear pair of comfortable/short shoes here and there will be lots of walking (especially walking uphill); Bring along drinking water, umbrella and hats during summer time; and Do keep the volume of talking low as there are still many residents staying here to avoid disturbing them.Highly recommended."
Beautiful traditional houses,Nice peaceful walk along the old traditional houses. This village is quite big so remember to follow the maps which are available along the way.Hanbok rental are available as well but I would recommend rent it from the shops near the Gyeongbokgung Palace as wearing Hanbok will allow you to have free entry into the palace.
Very nice,We signed up with Seoul Tourism Board free walking tour and we were assigned a English speaking guide Jennifer. She was very detailed and showed us the Village and even corners where no tourists knew. It was refreshing to find such as quaint place in the heart of Seoul city. I highly recommend you visit this place. Just a word of advice: Please be mindful that there are local residents living in midst of this village so please be considerate to the surrounding and the level of noise that you might be creating.
Glimpse into Seoul's past,"Definitely worth walking through in between palace visits--- convenient to do so. That said, it's hard to find the exact location- I'd recommend stopping in the visitors center to get map and guidance. Gives a great glimpse into Seoul's past."
Old Traditional Place,This are has lovely old traditional houses and gives you a feel for what the city must have been like in the past. There are lots of nice little shops and galleries around the little streets. Many of the old houses can be visited for a small fee.
A vision of the past,We had read about this location and didn't fully comprehend what it would be like. Be sure to pick up a map at the visitors center and watch the film. Then just wander around. It becomes quite obvious that this is a special place. 
Difficult to find from the palace,"It's not visible as it is behind new houses. Anyway it's very quiet and well maintained. There are many stores that sell clothes, cosmetics, foods, souvenirs, jewelry and many drink shops that are well decorated and nice view."
What a great place to visit ,"So stumble out of the subway and even if you get a bit lost like us you will eventually stumble across the village. People actually live in this village so please respect their privacy when trouncing around. Be mindful of your voice. There are plenty of options to look beyond the gated doors of traditional homes. Classic is seeing a lot of Asian you study going for Cosplay, wearing traditional costumes in the crazy heat. We came along in Autumn and it was still very warm. Can't imagine how uncomfortable it will be in mid summer Well worth the visit. Once back on the main drag grab yourself a traditional tea in any of the great tea rooms "
Cool to see an old neighbourhood in such a modern city,"The area is very cool. Go to the main information centre first, they will give you a map with suggested routes. It is best to follow the routes as determining the best route yourself could get tricky."
Fascinating Village,We walked through the narrow streets enjoying the pretty houses which were well looked after. The small shops and people gazing was in abundance. Definitely worth a visit.
"very traditional, nice view","It was very close to the Gyeongbokgung palace and I'm glad that i went there. You need to walk uphill to get there, but you will get a really nice view over the city. I really like the pictures i took there. But you should keep in mind that people still live in these houses. One of the houses is open for visitors and they also sell some souvenirs. There are also many souvenir shops or food stores in this area."
Lots of walking uphill.,"If you plan to visit this folk village, please ensure that you have good walking shoes. The road to the sites are all uphill, from Anguk Metro station. There will be a Tourist counter after you exit the subway. Get a map for the Bukchon Hanok Village. There will be sites that are numbered, site 1 for a view/glimpse of Changdeokgung Palace, site 3/4/5/6 are the main sites of the folk village. "
WalkAbout in Awe,"Loved walking through this area! Fun to see the traditional style, stop in the little shops and eat local street food. Kids and adults were engaged the entire time and it is a great place to walk through as you make you way from palace to Insadong!"
Biggest highlight of the trip!,"Beautiful area. Well worth visiting. Wonderful mix of old, historic Hanok properties with modern, on-point, trendy coffee shops and shopping options in other parts of the area. We did a tour to begin with and then went back and spent a whole afternoon there!"
Lovely old neighborhood in Seoul,"This was one of my favorite spots in Seoul. Traditional houses, good restaurants and great shopping."
Nice old Korean houses worth seeing ,The narrow streets with the small wooden houses are beautiful and good for pictures. It is really worth the walk from Insadong shopping street. You should love it if you love art. 
This is a nice add-on to a day hike in the area,"Take the Orange Metro Line (3) and get off at Anguk Station. Take exit 3 and walk. You can access Insadong, Itaewon and Bukchon in the same visit. The National Museum is close, as are a few of the palaces. Keep in mind, this is a residential neighbourhood and people appreciate your silence."
Historical Hanoks that we've all seen in dramas,A historic area of Seoul among the modern city. Frequently see it in k-dramas so it was nice to visit. You do have to be careful not to disturb the residents there though.
Lovely area of Seoul,"Beautiful historic area in Seoul, and a contrast to the rest of the modern city. Try to go early morning, or around sunset to get as few tourists around you. A few houses let you in for a small fee. Lonely Planet guides have a good walking map of the area."
A little bit of style,A nice short walk from the Palace and well worth going to for the good array of cafe's. When you decide to view the old style houses you will have a reasonable hole up the hill so not suitable for seniors on a wet day
Historic Korean homes,Nice little area to see historic Korean homes - near many restaurants and coffee shops for a sunny day stroll.Close to both palaces of Seoul.
A feel of old Seoul in the middle of the city,"In Bukchon you can get a very close idea how were the wealthy neighborhoods in Seoul 200, 300 years ago. Remember this is the middle of Seoul and people live in these houses... It is a nice stroll and some times uphill, so use comfortable shoes."
Nice walk,"It is nice to walk around the area to see the more traditional architecture, where people are still living there. "
Culture,"After a long and tired walk u will arrive at this place, Its nice place to take a photo here with some unique traditional village"
"Seoul is an amazing city, but visiting this part is a must!",A lovely suburb with cute traditional houses and a view of the modern city down below - a unique experience.
Beautiful Traditional Houses,Take a road map provided as you can find them along the street and just follow the steps given and you find yourself visiting these beautiful traditional houses without spending money on tour guides to bring you. 
Historic neighourhood,"Best thing to do is visit the tourist office first for a detailed map of Bukchon including a walk visiting all the highlights. Some parts are really pretty with traditional houses, some parts are not too interesting. Cobble stones, art, greens, little shops, restaurants. You're asked to walk around respecting the residents. "
Great place to spend a day,"The walk from the palace leads u to many nice quaint cafes & interesting little stalls/flea markets, after the right turn, all along the way. Was so distracted n mesmerized by everything. Direction sign as to where the villAge begin is unclear as the building along it looks similar but just relax, get lost, get soak in.. it's worth the walk. The village is at the end of the road.The village itself is another great experience will definitely return "
Korean traditional houses,It's not easy to locate the traditional Korean houses but no worries there are walking tourists information which let you know how to go there. Bukchon area is fun to visit...don't miss Bing-Bing shaved ice...the best one I ever tasted during the visit to Seoul. Also please make sure not to make a lot of noises during walking surrounding the houses - there are notices everywhere.....I just couldn't imagine myself living in this area with nonstop curious tourists walking around especially if the tourists could not read the notice due to language barrier.
Another feel in Seoul,"The surrounding area is very different with the modern city of Seoul, it is closed to UNESCO - Changdeokgung Palace Complex. You can feel traditional Hanok and palace is so peaceful. You don't find any luxury and brilliant building, but you can find how ancient Korea dynasty lifestyle, worth to go."
Traditional design Korean Houses,Street of traditional Korean residential houses left in the North of Seoul City.Not exactly old but still shows old Korean residential houses live in.
Houses with traditional doors,The village houses are owned and stayed by actual modern day Koreans so all the tourist just walk along the roads to take picture of the wooden doors and stone walls ... It is a hilly area and your photos almost cannot be exclusive as there are many others taking pictures as well
Picturesque neighborhood,"This is a cute area for good pictures especially up on top of the hill looking down. Pretty small area, but nice to look around and take a visit to the small shop that looks like an old fashion house."
Traditional Korean Houses,It's a village of preserved old traditional Korean houses. You can go around but it will get boring because they look all the same but its good to have some photo opp in one of the houses!
great for photo sesh,"We lovee this place, the houses, the tea houses, the mountain view at the end of the road was simply amazing. There's not much good restaurant nearby, note that we don't prefer eating at tourism areas. We were there from the morning and starved by the afro, couldn't find proper good korean meals and managed to walked down to angguk and went inside the crowded alley and found a great korean diner."
Different side to Seoul,It's nice walking around here as you see a more historical side to the city. Note that some of the streets are actually residential so you can't make too much noise. The closest station is Anguk and we combined this with a tour to the palace. 
Nice and cosy walk at this area. You may have your lunch and continue with a cup of coffee.,"Is a short walk of my day. But I have a wonderful meal during lunch. Never felt regret to dropby this place. Many of them can speak a little bit of english and chinese, so i wont felt lost there. "
"Really enjoyed this place, but it was so difficult to find the exact area ):","If I'm not mistaken, my friends and I walked around in circles for about an hour just trying to find the exact area where most people go to take pictures of. Navigation is not easy as well, even with maps provided. Many steep pathways and stairs to climb, but overall, all of us enjoyed our time here. We got to experience the cultural village, take beautiful photos, as well as mingling with a local roadside vendor which sold idol products. However, take note that this place is a residential area and lower down your volume at all times! Don't be inconsiderate to others."
Beautiful Houses ,Visited in July16. Will require lot of walking to cover entire village. Pick up a map from info booth right at start of village that wil show the best route you can cover. You can see Traditional homes here and they look beautiful. 
Super cute!!!,"This area is adorable. It's full of cute little streets and various cafes. Whilst it is touristy, you can easily turn off to another street and be in peace again. It is truly lovely and is worth a visit! "
Bukchon Hanok Village,"Bukchon, literally mean North Village. It is basically surrounded by Gyeongbokgung Palace. Changdeokgung Palace and Jongmyo, and not far from Insa-dong too. Group them together for a day visit of Korean traditional houses and palaces is truly memorable for any history lover!"
A trip through the ages,"While a stroll through Bukchon Village may feel like a trip through the ages, the neighborhood is not frozen in time. Some of the hanoks are still private homes, but others have been converted into tea houses, coffee shops, cafés, art galleries, inns and museums.Although it seems like its nothing much but I think I spent like 2 hours walking around the neighborhood. Just admiring the beautiful houses and the serenity it seems to bring being around there."
Awesome walk,Bukchon is a residential area and I had a good walk here with my friend. The traditional Korean houses here are so beautiful and you can take loads and loads of pictures around here. There are a lot of tourists around. You can get a map for the route to walk around at the tourist centre near to Anguk station exit no. 2. Definitely buy something cold to eat or drink if you come here in Summer!
Traditional Korean Houses ,"This was such an interesting experience. It's a long walk, going up and down the hills but it's quite worth it. The houses are very nice. Each house is different from each other but somehow tied up together and become architectural masterpiece. And it's amazing to see how the Koreans embrace their culture by still living in these houses. Highly recommended. "
Tradaition,You might try to wear the Hanbok there and take a photo in their village it has some craft workshop. Near Insadong if you want to stop by it while in Insadong
Conservation residential houses,Nice walk to just see how these old houses have been preserved and continue to used as residences. Walked through in the afternoon although I believed it would probably be more interesting with little cafes opened later in the evening and better sunset views...
Interesting finding,"Very interesting place. But be mindful. It is a residential area. So, keep you voice as low as possible and try not to anything not belonging to you."
"Nice for a stroll, traditionak Korean houses","Walk in the narrow street to have a sense of how traditional Korean houses looked like, however its a residential area so its changing and some irrelevant buildings are also there. Good for taking some nice shots"
Very touristy,We were really looking forward to exploring this area but when we got there it was so crowded and quite lacking in atmosphere. We stopped for a snack and a drink at a cafe and the prices were a total rip off.
Quiet and different. ,A nice experience. Lovely to see the local houses and how koreans lived traditionally. It's very quiet. You walk up and down hills and stairs. Each house is different from the next and yet somehow all tie together. There is even a craft studio where you can make your own crafts. You don't need much time here- it's a quick stopover. 
A must see must wander in Seoul,"this is a must see/must wander through area in Seoul. Easiest to do it in conjunction with a tour to one of the two big palaces. Its a lovely district to wander through, some great coffee shops and also some lovely small boutique stores and jewellery shops. you feel a million miles away from the hustle and bustle and some lovely photo opps. "
"Long walk, but worth the effort.","Even though some are of Bukchon is becoming too much commercialized like Insadong, many parts of Bukchon remains traditional. I would recommend visiting this place to anyone who travels Seoul. Stop by at Bukchonok restaurant which I recommended in my other review."
Korean drama fans would like to have a visit,"It's actually Korean traditional houses and there are really people living in it, so you cannot make loud noise. Quite a lot of people during that time. You will need to have a strong leg muscle to walk around Bukchon Hanok Village."
Hanok,"It is very special experience to live in a traditional Korea house. It is simple furniture and decoration. If you have come with an elderly, the Korea bed is too low for an elderly. Rather than this, everything is ok."
A glimpse of traditional Seoul life,"This place is a short walk from the Gyeongbokgung Palace. It was a very nice surprise, full of cute little houses, coffee places and gift shops. This is one of the few places in Seoul I would definitely visit again, so I highly recommend it."
Nice neighborhood with interesting architecture,Love the quaint building structures especially the doors and rooftop styles. Enjoy walking the streets and exploring some of the houses. You get the opportunity to dress in traditional hanbok and take photos in them or wear these costumes and walk around in them - all for a fee of course
Very nice ,Very nice part of town if you want to connect with original culture. Houses are you spectacular and there are many old shops. 
Bukchon Hanok Village,"After visiting Changdeokgung Palace we take a walk to Bukchon Hanok Village. Its a nice place to discover the traditional Korean houses. You can see some korean workshop (bukchon chogo, bukchon jeotdae, ...)."
Old Seoul,I really enjoyed walking the streets. I entered up through the back up some narrow stairs and wound my way down the lanes heading in general direction of the Main Street. I walked there from G palace. Some beautiful old quiet streets of you wander off a little.
Picturesque,"It's a nice contrast between the old village and traditional houses, with the modern city in the backdrop. However, too crowded and noisy when i intended for a relaxing stroll! !!"
It's walking through a neighborhood ,"Personally I don't really get the point. You can't see inside any of the houses. Crowded with tourists. The only marginally interesting part was the view from the overlook point. It free so if you are nearby, but would not go out of my way to see it. "
Historic walk,"Get your sneakers on as it's a hilly area, sometimes very steap too. Besides there many little shops for souvenirs but also tiny restaurants for a meal. Lots of hidden gems, take your time to discover them. Many hanoks to gaze at, however do respect the residents!"
Picturesque place but keep silent!,"Traditional rows of houses. While there are many notice and reminders hanging around indicating to keep noise level low due to they are people actually staying there, most tourists did not heed the advice. I think it will be a nuisance for me if I am staying there. Haha. By the way, we walked to here from Samcheongdong (would only suggest this if you have ample of time)"
"Quirky, interesting, traditional","It is a very quirky place to be, lined both with modern shops and renovated traditional-style houses. It is essential to step into the alleyway offshoots and spend some time at an interesting cafe. Don't arrive until at least after 10 or 11am or else everything will be closed. Come in the afternoon for Bukchon at it's most lively and bustling."
A nice and quiet place,"A good place to take photo when you are here, It's best you get a map from tourist counter and walk not only Bukchon but some other places too. This place is residential area, so basically can't make too much noise a lot of keep quiet sign around the place. "
"Beautfully preserved old houses, still functional",Beautifully preserved old houses that are still being lived in. Some of the owners have used the location of their homes to offer tourists stunning views of the Seoul skyline (they charge and entrance fee). Worth walking through these several streets. On the weekend you can see young Koreans dressed in traditional customs walking around.
Very Interesting Neighborhood for Wandering,"The Bukchon Hanok Village is an interesting neighborhood for wandering. The shops and restaurants here are smaller in size, but very nice and the quality of food and products is quite good. As one might expect in a older village, the streets are winding and full of hills, up and down. If you are looking for a great workout, this is your place! If you have trouble getting around, this is NOT your place. If it is raining or crazy hot it would be better to do this another day. You will need good walking shoes and an umbrella - not for rain, but for shade! If you are visiting during the summer heat, this neighborhood would be best visited early or late in the day."
"Quiet, peaceful, beautiful",It is a beautiful place to walk around and get a feel for the traditional houses and see with what care people take care of it and live in history. For me it was a good display that modern and old can live side by side without being out of balance. A minus can be that you have steep climbs. I went there with no expectations and what I saw was simply put beautiful.
Interesting!,"Village with traditional Korean houses. Interestingly, it is in the heart of Seoul's most expensive district."
Two thumbs up!,"i must say this is one of best attraction in Seoul. The alleys are filled with traditional Korean houses that was so amazing to see. Unfortunately, you can't see inside the house because it is personal residences."
Very Interesting Place to Visit,Went here with my family and I must say this village is one of the best area to visit in Seoul. You will see lots of houses which is transformed into shops and next to it there will be an alley leading to a traditional style house which people still live in it. Very nice and very interesting place to go for a walk.
old style house,"as people still lives in this area, we tried to keep quiet during our visit here. but the most loud one is either chinese tourist or local people themselves -_- nevertheless bukchon is amazing. even the house is still preverse in traditional style, their doors, gate, ornament etc is very interesting. its kind of hard to get photo (alone) because of sea of tourists, even in weekdaysalso close to insadong, just across the street"
Loved this Area,"This neighborhood of streets and alleys are filled with hanoks, traditional-Korean houses, that either serve as personal residences, guesthouses for people to stay in, or shops. I found the Bukchon Cultural Center one of the days and was able to make one of the art projects they had with a third-generation artisan. She was so skilled and quick that I was thankful for her. The urban explorer loved this, going down alleys to dead ends, turning around and having to go another way, happening upon a mural here, a cool coffee shop there, a lovely restaurant that served a bibimbap dish that was tasty, and so on...I'd go back to Seoul to explore this area more!"
Quirky yet traditional,"Loved the whole Bukchon area as it had several quirky cafes and shops mixed with traditional handicrafts, traditional houses (Hanok) and was such a mix mash of sights and sounds. There were many dressed up in the hanbok (Korean costume) to take photos also. Do climb (yes the slopes can get pretty steep here) to the vantage points for awesome views of the Seoul tower and mountains. "
Good glimpse into ancient Korea,"Bukchon, meaning North Village (north of the Han river) is a collection of traditional hanoks, houses of Koreans in the past. They are wonderfully preserved and people still do stay in them. As it is a residential area, do keep noise to a minimum, and let yourself get transported into the past. Try to find the eight photo spots - do not miss number 6. "
Tradition local homes,"The traditional local homes are very unique. Some homes even offer home stays to experience the Korean culture. Nice neighbourhood.If you are there in the evening, do try to catch the view of the sunset with the city buildings as a backdrop. Do observe their rules - be quiet as it is a residential area. "
Really Enjoyed this Area!,"Not only did we enjoy the opportunity to stay in one of the Hanoks (traditional Korean housing complex) in Bukchon Village, we also spent the better part of two days exploring the village. It's great that these houses were preserved, that actual people live in them, and that the surrounding area is filled with vibrant shops, restaurants, locals, visitors and energy. I'd highly recommend visiting Bukchon Village."
A must visit!,"There will be a lot of walking but you don't think about it when you admire the traditional Korean houses. There is a tourist info where you can get a free map with suggested routes. There are also small shops, cafes and restaurants if you feel like a taking a break or grabbing a coffee or smoothie to go."
Experience the Joseon Dynasty,"Buckchon is a traditional Korean village made up of clusters of ""hanoks"" or traditional Korean homes. Stroll along the alleys and feel like you are back in time ( more than 500 years ago). The architecture- the old roofs, doors, and windows, and the beautiful courtyards are unique to this village. "
Interesting but nothing much to do,"I liked taking photos but that's about it. Maybe I just wasn't able to explore it properly? We followed the arrows though. Go here before or after Samcheongdong! If you're coming from Samcheongdong, look for the stairs going up to Bukchon. "
Seoul's version of America's Colonial Williamsburg,"I have lived in Asia for more than a decade and have traveled all over the region. To find such a well-preserved, clean, neat, tidy and interesting reconstructed ancient village is a delight. People do actually live in this village (lucky them!) so being quiet and respectful is a must. My local friend brought me here and we had many photo ops wandering the little streets and ducking into shops. I wish I had more time to experience this little gem.The shops sell items we foreigners really want, which is also a wonderful surprise. I was able to clean up in the souvenir department just in this one area. Coffee shops and trinkets galore. Enjoy!"
Beautiful and typical area ,"Beautiful houses and quaint streets with great views of Seoul. Quite steep streets so can be tiring in a hot day . In the streets below there are high level shops and galleries, very affluent area. "
Great place,"This ancient city is a must do in seoul, it still has the essence of the ancient town with a touch of modern, here you will find a lot of wooden houses mix with concrete, along the town you will get free wifi in some places.They have several places where you can rent the typical dress of Korea to take pictures for 10000 won.Try to visit the observatory at the tea museum."
Korean traditional houses,people actually lives here and it gets quite annoying when there are a lot of people. a great place to take pictures
go early,Well worth an early start. We arrived at 10am on a Monday and it was already swarming with other tourists. Their noise paired with sea of selfie sticks and photo shoots impacted greatly on what would otherwise be a sceinic and pleasant stroll.
Charming ,You walk up the hilly streets among the hanoks. Then you turn around and see the view of the modern city in between the traditional hanok walls. On the way down you get a glimpse of Gyeongbokgung Palace. This is why you travel 5000+ miles to Seoul.
Old style,Very interesting and unique styling houses. There are shops and restaurants close by. Main attractions are the houses and I can't stop but feel sorry for the residents. There's a guide there explaining to his tour that they need to respect the residents privacy by keeping their voice down during visit. Interesting that he said that when he was the loudest one there!
Shopping!,I enjoyed shopping in this trendy district. The food and handmade shops are excellent. There are a lot of good finds and plenty of places to explore!
Korean BBQ,"I had an outdoor Korean BBQ dinner here and it was so cool, yummy too, just steps from this advertisement photo"
Lovely but not a lot to do,"As two travelers in our mid-thirties, we only found this engaging for about 30 minutes. The craft making is great, but primarily intended for families. Beautiful architecture and homes, but that's about it."
Worth visiting for a walk in a more quiet part of Seul,"My fiancée and I spent about an hour or so walking through the streets in the Bukchon area. There are lots of old / traditional Korean houses there and next to no car traffic (only residents driving to and from their homes I suspect).Unless you are here early in the morning there will however be lots and lots of other tourists in the area - so many that I sort of feel bad for the people who live here. You will find signs everywhere reading ""Please be quiet"" or ""Please don't stand on the stairs"".You'll also find some galleries selling art (figurines, paintings) and shops selling perfume, soaps, candles etc. in this area.There are a couple of nice palaces in walking distance from this old town as well, hence visiting this area is well worth the trip."
Such a nice village,"Quiet and charming, this is such a beautiful cultural village with wonderful clean streets and nice shops along the way. I definitely recommend here as to myeongdong and since it is opposite of Anguk and Invading and smack in between the two top palace in Seoul, this makes a wonderful stop"
Best place to see Seoul's traditional side,"I loved the old style houses and numerous people wearing Hanbok. If visiting in summer, try to come in the evening instead of during the day as it is too hot."
Old Korea,"People see the modern South Korea from various KDramas. Thus, they tend to know more of the present South Korea. This place actually enable people to have a glimpse of the past and get a grasp on how much had change since then. This is a good walking experience.Tip: not for those who have difficulty in climbing various roads or places."
Pretty Little Village,"The village is a pretty sight. It's accessible from the subway/metro Line 3 station Anguk. You only need around 30 minutes to go around the village. And one has to observe silence and respect the neighbourhood (it is a private village). There's a nice cafe, Dooroo, by the entrance to the village. And, there is a nice little souvenir shop along the road to the station (see photo).July by the way, is monsoon season in Korea so be prepared for rain. "
walk in the village,A good place for those who like the korean traditional houses. Just prepare your self for long walking with road hill elevated. This place is a picturesque.
A Slice of History,"Beautiful architecture and great winding streets. I visited Bukchon on a Saturday afternoon in April and it was very busy, but it was beautiful. There are a lot of hills to walk so wear comfortable shoes. This is a great location to see the traditional korean houses."
Nice small village,"The village is at a convenient location in the city which makes transportation quite easy. Since Korea's taxis are cheap, we decided to take it to Bukchon Village.At the village, there's some souvenir shops and small cafes for you to sit and relax. There are also some sites where you can walk into the traditional homes but with a small fee. The walk around the village for tourists is not that long. In fact, I would estimate about a 15 -20 minute walk in total. We came during the evening which was a bit crowded but it was tolerable. The views from uphill of the village is great. There were many tourists taking the views as well which shows the image of all the traditional homes. "
Bukchon Hanok Village,"The village located in the center of Seoul is home to hundreds of traditional houses (hanoks) that date back to the Joseon Dynasty. Many of these hanoks operate as cultural centers, guesthouses & tea houses, providing visitors an opportunity to experience, learn & immerse in Korean traditional culture. It is very easy going and one stroll through the streets and admire the scenery."
Must-visit place when you're in Seoul,"I love the place, the place is a declared UNESCO World Heritage and so is a must-visit place in Seoul. Definitely a very nice experience. Make sure to grab a copy of the map for you not to miss the 8 photo points. There are markings to follow and you won't get lost. Make sure you don't have heavy bags as you will surely be engaging yourself to a long walk around the neighborhood. There are a lot of tea shops and small boutiques that are worth visiting."
Peaceful and rustic,"Love the stroll recommended online (you can easily find plenty of info on bukchon village trail). I took about half a day to visit all 8 photo points on map. Don't worry about being lost - there are roving guides at various spots to assist. Do spend some time to soak in the atmosphere. Bring along water, a brolly and hat as summer can be scorching. Stop at various cafes and shops to rest and relax. This place is a must visit for first-timers to Seoul!"
Bukchon is a must-do for art and architecture lovers,"Bukchon is my favorite neighborhood. It's my favorite because of the preservation of historic homes and building styles typical throughout Seoul before the redevelopment. In one particular area, there are many of these homes that are living artist studios where you can visit (often for a $1 cost), and for an additional cost you can make art or a craft with them. We have done a few of these, and have done with just adults and with kids, and everyone not only had a great time, but also made a functional piece of art for use or display. Our party made painted necklaces for $10, painted hair decoration for $10, did a woodblock print ($3), and learned how to tie buttons from cord (free). If you have time, we highly suggest a visit to a studio or art center, there are mostly just drop in, so you can find one that interests you.Another popular stop is a teahouse. There are many, and most walking tours pass by at least one. Teahouses usually involve a cup of tea and a sweet, but cost more than many travelers think it should, but the experience is worth it for many. It is easy to enjoy a walking tour through the neighborhood, there are tours outlined in many different guidebooks or websites. We started at one corner down on the street that goes the palaces, and walked up and through the neighborhood, and then back down to the other side, and ended by the big palace and walking past the folk museum. Just make sure your walking tour gets you ""up"" enough where you can wander through the neighborhoods of hanok, the traditional homes. A picture of the roof lines is worth the visit."
"Walking, walking, hiking, walking ","Bukchon is situated on a sloping hill, like much of Seoul. So wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to walk work those calves! Beautiful houses, the only thing is its a little weird because people live there and I felt awkward taking pictures of their houses."
Ok but very crowded,Good to have a quick stroll through but the Namsangol Hanok Village was far more enjoyable to visit in my opinion. 
Cute little streets,"I went with friends in hanbok and it made for a wonderful photo opportunity! It was as if we had stepped back in time for a bit. Not the easiest place to find, because everywhere we turned said 'bukchon-gil' but after asking some locals we found our way to the main street that you always see in photos. Definitely worth a trip to if in seoul."
Quaint and cosy village ! ,"Can't believe I have missed this on previous trips to Seoul. Definitely very nice to walk around the village where nobles used to stay. Many cafes and small shops selling fashionable items as well! We enjoyed a great afternoon here. If too warm, would suggest to skip as a lot of walking and up hills. "
What a place,What a sensational place to visit best in Seoul. Old historical area of seoul. Not far from metro station. 6 stops Seoul station line 3. Fine local food in area.
Nice and quiet street with good historical features,"When u have done too much shopping, it would be nice to walk around here. Quiet Street and I am having some traditional Korean tea here. "
A must see in Seoul and....,"you can also see Insadong since it is a short 5-10 minute walk from there. Also, it is best to come by subway."
Average,"This is a nice part of the city, where you can see some original Japanese houses. Don't visit on a sunny day because it can be very hot in the small streets. Shops are closed on sunday!"
Beautiful Architecture - Old and New ,"Give yourself a day to enjoy the many art galleries, shops, great eating and beautiful old village of Bukchon. The architecture is a stunning mix of old and new. A beautiful heritage area worth the protection it has been afforded. Heaps of tourists there so don't be surprised by the request from residents to not step in their doorsteps and for silence when you're looking around. "
lovely way to spend a few hours strolling around...,"we really enjoyed spending a few hours strolling around the streets of Bukchon, admiring the old houses and visiting the shops and galleries in the area. There are excellent free english maps available from stands near the train station, which highlight the sights in the area. definitely a must do on a trip to seoul."
Traditional houses. Worth visiting. ,"Bukchon is the area of transitional Korean houses. There is not much going on but certainly worth visiting just because you are in Korea. Some houses charges entrance fees for touring the house and asking questions. Some offer traditional crafts for a fee between 10,000-20,000 won. Is fun to try some of the crafts. They might look easy but you will be surprised it can be so tedious! My niece dropped her iPhone and the screen cracked. So be careful with your phones when you are there because there so many big and small stones everywhere on the floor. Whichever angle at which you dropped your phone, chances are the screen will crack. "
Different types of houses,This is an old part of Korea with the buildings preserved so it looks very nice. Yet it seems to be a tiny street and there is very little things which are uniform. hence it seems part of the charm as it is not entirely fake. A lot of tea houses etc and somewhat manicured look. A lot of museums around the area as well. 
A stroll back to old times,It was like walking back in history. Get here early in the morning before everyone else and take the recommended trail starting from the main street. Enjoy the peace and tranquillity as you venture into the small alleys. You wonder what lies behind the walls of these houses and what was life like in the good old days. Some of these houses have been turned into galleries but will only open later when the crowds arrive. Quiet signs are everywhere and you can understand why as this is truly a popular spot.
Take a walking tour through Old Korea!,"Bukchon is the historically preserved neighborhood of Seoul. Most of the true old style houses are located within a quite residential neighborhood. Nice to grab a map and stroll around. There are some nice photo ops, although most of the actual houses are not open to the public. I found some streets to be quite lovely and peaceful; some others I hit right as tour buses were unloading and that was not so great. They have people stationed on some of the corners asking tourists to be quiet, since it is a residential neighborhood, but the tour groups I was near ignored that and were very loud and rude. So, try to time it to arrive early before those buses. Some of the surrounding streets have some nice cafes and coffee shops. You can also find a bunch of places offering workshops in various crafts like woodworking, kite making, and knot tying. If I had an extra day I would have made time to do one of those. Plan on doing a lot of walking, including up and down a lot of hills. "
best cultural sight,real traditional houses . get a map from the street tourist info. We went early before the tour group arrived. lots of walking. These are private residences and some tourists are inconsiderate and spoke loudly. There is one particular traditional house that is open to public for a fee. Worth the visit to see inside it. Lovely garden and rooms. Recommend that U visit this house.
Bukchon hanok Village,"We were on a quest to find an example of an old Korean village and found Bukchon Hanok Village. The architecture was a great example of the old style buildings or ""hanok"" which means traditional buildings. The site is hilly and the alleys are narrow. Worth the trip and walks."
Island of old Korea,"Residential area in the style of old Korea, worth a visit to see the architecture, these are private residences so bare that in mind. Don't go too early or all the shops will be closed. Many tourists come in by bus and can make it crowded, easy to get to by metro, and then visit the nearby markets."
Tranquility within the city,Definitely sign up for the free two hour walking tour and the. Stay after to enjoy lunch and a bit of shopping. 
Bukchon,"not easy to find, we had a long walk before we found it. its basically a row of unique korean houses (its a residential area) which is only found in korea. along the way, there are shops / eateries."
Great walk thru thr village ,went to visit since it's near to Gyeongbokgung... it was a nice walk seeing rows of Hanok.. but do be prepared for lots of tourists. 
Warm hearts on a cold rainy day,"It was a mild rainy day when we visited Bukchon Hanok Village, but it did not dampen the charm of the place. We started off with a late lunch as soon as we arrived, coming from a leisurely walk from Gyeongbokgung Palace. You could pair your sightseeing going to the Palace first, look around, watch the changing of guards, then proceed to Bukchon. Everything in Seoul is accesible by train or bus, anyway. But if you can take the 15-minute leisure walk to Bukchon, do so by all means. Good exercise and it helps increase your feel of the area. Then explore the place with the quaint houses and unique shops, eating really good ice cream and streetfood along the way, and just enjoying the quiet and lovely scenes around the village. We went up and down the streets, looking for interesting shops. I didn't realize that this could be an interesting activity for my young adult children. We even entered an art gallery with amazing paintings! The locals were very hospitable and though we were foreigners, we were made to feel so welcome! It truly warmed our hearts especially on a cold rainy day. "
A slice of authentic history,Seoul as it once was. This is a touristic place but still worth the effort of visiting. Book a guide to get an insight into the lives of the people who still live here.
Traditional Village,There are a lot of Korean traditional house in that village. It is a mountain view and many tourist visit at place.
Old Korea,"Quite a walk from the train station, but there are a lot of stores to see along the way, so you won't find it too tedious. Street is also lined up with coffee shops so you can take a break somewhere.This is a great place to have a look at traditional Korean architecture, perfect spot for a couple of selfies and photos. Don't go here on a rainy day."
Time travel,"Perfect place to see old Seoul architecture. If you want you can even rent a traditional costume and walk around the village. It is fun, though don't forget to keep quiet since it is a residential area. "
A walk from the past,Great place to have a look at Korean architecture and boutique shops and cafes. A bit touristy but that's given cause it is a beautiful and well preserved neighbourhood. 
Good for a pleasant stroll,"In Seoul, a city dotted with high-rise apartments, its nice to see these old Hanok houses in the Bukchon Village. Its pleasant strolling through the narrow lanes between houses. There are many arts and crafts experience workshops (at a fee) in the area plus many cute shops while walking towards the village from direction of Anguk Station exit 6. The up and down hilly feel of the village gives you a nice view of the city and the N-Seoul Tower. There is a house in the area (cant recall exact name/street) still occupied by locals, where you can go up to the terrace for a fee (I think it was KRW 2,000/pp) and order a free item from the beverage/snacks menu while enjoying nice views of the area and giving your feet a rest as well!"
Wander the Streets of Seoul,"If you are just visiting Seoul and you are feeling overwhelmed by all the high rises and developed areas, this is a good look into the past. This is really a neighborhood and so please be respectful as you climb up and down the hills. You will see the traditional Hanoak style houses. The roofs are amazing and you can just imagine what it is like having a courtyard in the middle of your home. Come here to explore Korea's deep history and have some quiet time."
Interesting place to visit for free,"For backpackers or any travellers who visit Seoul, I very recommended this place. If you love to take a walk by foot there are many to explore in this area. Take subway and stop in Anguk Station, at first you can cross or shopping for souvenirs in Insadong the just walk by foot about 5-10 minutes to Bukchon if you go directly but I bet you will stop couple of times because on your way to Bukchon you will see some interesting art galleries, museums, or old churces. From top of Bukchon, you can see the city view. You can take a rest and have some coffee or liquor and enjoy the fresh air. You can request free tour (check in internet, many volunteers offer free guide) or like me, I just like to explore by myself. "
Pleasant walk but a bit touristy,Bukchon is touristy but it is still worth walking around and checking out this artsy area just to relax and see some historical homes. Come early in the morning to avoid the crowds and then you can check out the nearby palaces. Restaurants are expensive here but there is a good variety if you are hungry. 
Real Seoul,the strees of Bukchon give you glimspe of real Korean Culture. get a trail map from any of the shops in the street and walk through the trail. You can see the traditional Korean houses and on the way visit multiple Korean arts and painting centers. You can also take Korean painting lessons for 45 minutes. We were lucky that one of the residents was kind enough to welcome us to their house and show us around. The lay out of Korean Houses are very different and interesting.
Interesting experience,"Little 'fashionable' shops and where the trendy young people of seoul like to flock, but expensive by local standards. It has a nice feel and interesting little boutiques and cafes"
Beautiful architecture and great shops!,Enjoyed walking around and seeing great history! There are a million photo opportunities and a shop and restaurant that caters to anyone. 
Jeonju Hanok village away more beautiful,"The sightseeing area is not very big. If you don't have time to visit Jeonju,better to just go at Namsan Hanok Village rather than Bukchon. For you who want to get more traditional feel of hanok village Jeonju is definetly must visit place."
Urban Village in a Gritty City,"Let's all face it. Seoul is a gritty city not the least of which is the continuous smog and particulates (not to mention the seasonal flows of yellow dust from the Gobi) - albeit air quality is still better than highly populated Chinese cities. Once you've recovered from a long evening of neon lights and clubs, there must be something else. Yes, you got it; it's Bukchon. Only last year did I discover, via an offer for a weekend sightseeing afternoon from a native Seoulite, this quaint urban village after many years of business travel to Seoul. I think that most hotels will quickly send you to Insadong, which is fine. But it is largely craft shops on a single street without the diversity provided by Bukchon. Here you will find craft and designer shops sandwiched in among restaurants and coffee shops. The terrain is interesting too in that the roads wind and climb little hillocks. There are trees lining streets and Samcheong park is nearby for a stroll or a 1/2 day hike around the old Seoul city wall. Shared walled houses and B&Bs and curved roofs covered in tiles are a unique site in a city of largely concrete and glass. Take my advice and go there."
Great strolling area,"I went here in the evening, but I wish I'd arrived even an hour earlier, to see more of the nearby shops open. It's a lovely section, but quiet--this is not the place to bring kids to roam the streets. Duck into any one of the tea or coffee houses nearby and enjoy great people watching as well. Well worth a detour in your itinerary to wander through. "
Very nice!,An uphill walk to get to the village. Kinda disappointed since there were no hanok rentals nearby but overall the place is a must see
Good for picture taking,"If you are going to the palaces, it is a good detour to walk around the neighbourhood to see the traditional houses and take some pictures. However, it may not be worth the extra effort just to make a special trip to visit. "
Keep quiet!,"It's a residential area so please keep quiet whilst visiting! Go grab a map at the tourist information desk and follow the route, went during dawn and got to see sunset among the way. Stunning!"
"Interesting, beautiful, and a good cardio workout!","I would suggest for anyone to get a tour (one of those free walking tours), and let them bring you around the village. I had an awesome 2 hours walking around, taking pictures, listening to the history and taking in the beautiful surrounding. At the end of the tour, you will most definitely have a workout... as they have quite steep hills on certain streets, and the village in general is on a hilly area."
never missed,take a walk in bukchon a chill and relax stroll a fantastic walk and relax walk around the traditonal house in seoul after the walk grab a cuppa at cafe surrounding it
A must see!,"Strolled this quaint, chic historic neighborhood. Adored the shops and restaurants nestled in the historic buildings. A cool, hip vibe we enjoyed!"
Can still see traditional village in bustling city,"This is a must go place when visiting Seoul. At least you will get a chance to see beautiful old buidlings which are still very well maintained. Some of these buildings were converted to museum which open to tourist. If going there during summer, can be very sunny, do bring along sunglasses and umbrella. Need some uphill walking(proper road),make sure you put on comfortable shoes."
"semi-authentic, picturesque, but still too artificial","a nice look into the living standards in Seoul 500 years ago, however the renovation is demonstrated and does not contribute to the authentic spirit of this place. good preserved, sometimes overcowded"
"Ancient looking houses, interesting street","Alike the Kyoto of Japan, this is a residential area in the part of Seoul. There are many shops allowing tourists to try their traditional outfit.. The streets are also great for photography or just experience the ancient feel of Seoul."
quaint place although a bit overrun with big tour groups,After the Gyeongbokgung Palace you might as well visit Bukchon since it is just around the corner from it's northern gate exit. It's a very quaint place with keep quiet signs everywhere that unfortunately people generally ignore!
Beautiful historical site in Seoul,I had a good walk climbing minor slope of Bukchon Village. I loved to see old buildings that have kept in a very good conditions. There are many shops and restaurants along the street. It is amazing to know there are real people who still live in the area. 
A nice walk,"This area, although a tourist attraction is not for everyone. If you don't like climbing steep roads and taking in the atmosphere then this is not for you. Essentially this is a long walk around reconstructed buildings with homestays, shops and various activities you can participate in. Personally I think it's a nice walk and I enjoy the atmosphere. I'm not sure why the bad reviews say it's hard to find. I had no problems finding the place and there are even information helpers in red clothing if you need assistance. Remember if you go on Monday, all the activity shops are closed as well as some of the regular shops too."
How the Koreans in the past lived,Interesting place to see how Seoul people lived in the past. There are little cafes which have set up around the area which makes for interesting teas and dinner with friends 
Nothing much to see,"Nothing special to see, really. It was also very crowded with tour groups when we visited on a Monday."
Interesting traditional houses,"Had visited this area before. A residential area with local people living here. Galleries, cafes, and local restaurants fill this area . Popular with tourists and high school students. Relatively quiet during weekdays compared to my last visit ( which was on the weekend). Pleasant stroll. "
Hard to find the photo taking spot! ,"Pretty view but hard to spot. Stamina must be good enough to crawl up the steep slope. Look for information crew member before you moved on, signage was not visible showed on the walls. There is around 8 photo taking point. The famous E photo taking point is point 5 & 6. Try to go during weekdays and avoid public holiday. U won't be able to shoot nice scenery with many heads on. Haha! Sufficient sunblock is necessary. I had burnt even walking around at 11am. "
Bukchon walk,"We headed straight to the information centre for a map and asked for a recommended route. Lots of walking, lots of tourist, lots to see and photograph. The quaint shops along the way added to our enjoyment."
"A pleasant walk in history, beautiful old houses.","This place is amazing! So glad I decided to come here. After coming out from the subway, I go straight to the tourist center to get a map of this area. There was a suggested route which lead us to some buildings/ houses with history. The route was beautiful and is like in the old movie. Sometimes there will be people wearing hanbook passing by and made this feeling of unreal stronger. Along the way we get to visit nice shops, craft shops and nice cafe. I bumped into a cultural shop where after paying 10000 won, I get to wear hanbook for one hour. Such an amazing experience! The end of the route brought us to ChangDeGung. Really enjoy the whole experience and would come back here again."
Neighborhood with traditional Hanok style homes.,"Interesting stroll through this beautiful neighborhood of traditional Hanok Village. (Remember to be mindful of people living here and not be to loud.)There are information stops if you need directions or helpful tips, map of the area. English speaker available to assist.)"
Fun walk,Walk around Bukchon is a fun escape from the modern landscape of downtown Seoul.Make sure to pick up a map from the tourist center. Start the walk towards the east so you wrap up the walk on the west side where there are shops and cafe on the big Main street. Head over to Insadong right afterwards!
Must see,I just walked from my hotel to that place. It's lovely to walk around and see how people live ans shop in Bukchon. It wasn't sunny when I was there but it was really great!
Nice place to wonder,"I loved this place because it's very artistic and you could take a lot of pictures, you will also fall in love with those old buildings."
Nice street with ancient houses,This is my second visit to Bukchon. The ancient houses still holds much charm to me. This time round we walked along the slope and found it to be another way to admire this area. Some areas can get a bit crowded and hard to get a good nice shot. Quite a number of people dressed in traditional hanbok came to have photos taken. Nice place to spend an hour or two for a slow walk and photo taking. 
Nice place to see their traditional house,"Good to just take a slow walk around this area. Taking photos and looking around.After here, you can go to Samcheong dong for a meal or hang out at their many cafes. "
Quaint shops and streets ,"A lovely, quiet residential area that is nonetheless popular with many many tourists. Try to avoid weekends if you want an unobstructed view of Seoul tower from the top of the hill. It is really worth meandering around the streets between Bukchon and the palace as there are lots of funky little shops."
Too touristy ,"Some nice old wooden houses, but too touristy for me. All houses where fenced so not much to see for me. I would skip this if you have just one day."
Love the houses,"Traditional houses in Bukchon village is very well maintained, maybe you can feel like you're in one of those Kdrama, lol. However, it is also a regular neighborhood area so we should also bear in mind to not disturb the house owner.One additional thing, I came here on Sunday so i don't know whether it is because of weekend its so packed there or in general bukchon is always crowded"
Typical Korean Village recreated.,"Very interesting area, actually people really live there, some nice cafes and shops, but mostly artsy and panoramic views."
Great place to unwind,"If you're looking to unwind and take your mind off things, then Bukchon would be the place to go. Because it's a residential neighbourhood, it's quiet so you can take long walks down the quiet alleys and enjoy the feel of old Seoul. There are also some neat little museums where you can take workshops like lacquering, tying traditional knots etc. I went to the Donglim Knot Museum and had fun learning how to make a bracelet, but if you're not into crafts, you can still always stop by to buy a hand-made souvenir. "
Beautiful,We took the recommendation from Lonely Planet to walk around the whole Bukchon area. It's beautiful! We went there about 10am and the streets are still quiet. We have a lot of opportunities to take photos and take a good look of the shops and restaurants. If you are fit enough you should go all the way up to the look out. It isn't that high but it's interesting to look over some traditional homes. I m sure it looks amazing during autumn.
Nice for hanging out time,traditional village and absorbed the modern life too. It was interesting walking and seeing locals. Passed plenty of shop place and few good restaurant. Just admire the local staff creativity totally worth visit
very good for take picture especially,"the house is beautiful, location really good, the environment is so comfortable, clean .I hope tourist more polite and not make too loud voice"
Traditional charms still remain here even after attacks of franchises...,"I used to live here until last year and I chose this area because its charm of traditional feeling and small cute stores around the town. Well, the first demolition happened a decade ago in terms of construction, then the second demolition in its personality is on the way. I would say even for that short 3 years of my staying there, I've witnessed more than 50% of my favorite stores including small handmade shops, real cafés, local restaurants had been replaced by worldwide or local super power franchises. This was really frustrating and became a reason to leave the town... I still give 4 stars though because there are yet some survivors struggling against the push of landlords and also there are beautiful narrow hidden alleys all around the corners. Just avoid the main road and super chains if possible if you want the real town coming slowly back to us."
Lovely!,"Very nice area, quaint and clean. A must to see, because it's the old area of Seoul. the houses are very well kept. Many shops around it. Lots of walking and uphill, bring comfortable walking shoes. We found a tea house with an amazing view inside Bukchon, but cannot remember the name of it."
Nice little alleys,"Good opportunity to see authentic Korean architecture still in use. Best reason to visit the place is the cheap food from numerous stands. Also the only place where I found the famous rice wine (and paid only 1,500₩ for a large cup!)"
Where the old meets the new,"It's really great to have this place and be able to see old-fashioned korean houses in the center of a modern city as Seoul. You will have to walk a bit but it is worthy, I got a lot of excelent pictures and fell in love with korean culture."
A taste of old Seoul,"A nice place to visit and see the traditional Korean buildings but the narrow streets gives ""crowdy"" feeling. When I visited there, I found that many tourists rented the traditional Korean dress, a HANBOK, and travelled around the place wearing it and took pictures. You may try to taste but I didn't as I wanted to spent more time enjoying the nature environment."
Worth a trip ,"But of a nightmare to find on foot but worth a visit on a sunny day for great views! About a ten minute walk from Anguk station, lots of restaurants to eat in albeit EVERYTHING is in Korean with little English translation. This is a residential area so visitors need to be respectful of locals who are living in the Hanoks. A good way to spend an afternoon or evening. We found a vantage point and watched the sunset, can't beat that! "
Getting the feel of a Korean village,This place is really well known for both locals and tourists. It is best to put a Hanbok on (which can be rented at least for an hour) and take a picture here for an added feel.
Traditional seoul houses,"Interesting place where we get to see well preserved traditional korean houses. Other than these, the nearby streets offered quaint charming shops selling clothes, accessories, arty stuff n food. Nice place to spend half a day. "
A Maze-ing,"We walked our way from the blue house exit of the Gyeongbukgong Palace to Bukchon.I found the place interesting. There were lots of shops, restaurants and people too. We were looking for the traditional houses and did not mind the what looked novel. It took us a while to find the traditional houses. We traversed the road leading up a hill and found concrete stairs leading down only to find out that we're back to where we came from. We climbed up again and took our chance at a corner leading to the observatory until we came to a narrow street that was lined with the traditional houses and there were several streets like this. We just followed the path where our eyes took us and reached another street that led us to Insadong.Over all you need the energy to do the walking that we did, but exploration was what we were there for. It was hard for us to take the bus because the routes were not written in English. It was quite exhausting but worth it. "
Nice area to have a walk in the afternoon,Lots of traditional houses as well as nice contemporary architecture around the area. It definitely deserves a visit.
Old Seoul,Lovely area with original old houses and streets- how Seoul would have looked in the past such a contrast to the high rise of today . Lovely area to walk around and nice coffee shops and galleries.
Cool buildings and some shopping,This had more of a historical feel to it than the rest of Seoul. It's nice to walk around but no need to spend more than a couple of hours there.
The hip and the old,bylanes of the old crisscross with the touristy and this up and down long walk deserves both aimless strolling and a useful local walking tour to catch what you may have missed in terms of vantage points and historical value. 
So beautiful,"The houses is almost old but still beautiful and so charming. Easy to go there and if you been there,please be quiet because all that houses still have people to live."
Seoul can call itself proud to have a quarter like this kept up and not levelled,"This is how many years back Seoul must have looked. Growth and prosperity asked for its price and whole quarters got levelled. There is a nice round trip by foot with lots of cafe stops and interesting little handicraft places. In itself, it looks magically removed from daily pulse of Seoul..."
well preserved,"The Hanok houses are all very well preserved, pleasant walk with really steep slopes at some parts. I feel really bad for the people living there, even though there were lots of signs reminding people to keep their volume down, some groups are still very noisy. Please be considerate!"
good travel spot,"This is a place you could not miss if visiting Seoul. This is my second trip and we still enjoyed the nice walks and the views when you walked around it. After the hilltop views, you can walk down with all the coffeeand a bit of shopping areas around. It's a very nice place to visit and choose the time around noon to avoid those tours as they mostly visit in the morning. Worth going and can do lunch around that area as well."
Nice visit there,"I love historical building there, been there three times already. When you feel tired due to long walk, you can go to coffee shops as a lots are there. A quiet and good place for visiting in city town. "
A pleasant walk,"As part of the incentives as Korean Air transit passengers, we signed up a 5 hours day trip, provided free by the Incheon Airport. This is one of the highlight we went, and all I could say was it was indeed a very nice place to walk about, even we just have 1 hour to enjoy it (2 hours return bus trip from and to airport, plus another 2 hour visit to other destination) . It is a bit steep in some part of the trail, but overall it granted the view of Seoul and the historic houses. The nearby has many cafe and shopping alley, and though the alleyways were small, they limit access of big vehicles and so it was relatively safe at the same time. "
A hike and confusing starting point,"Be prepared to walk, up some steep slopes and stairs. Since it's a residential area, unless you visit the tea house for example, you will not get a view of the quarters. The plus is seeing ladies wearing hanbok doing the tour, which is part of Korea tourism promotion. "
quaint area with nice architecture,"nice architecture of the houses - if you stay in a city, this place might be worth visiting as it's something you'll never see in cities. surrounded by quaint shops nearby. only downside was that it's gets a little crowded as it's a tourist spot and crowd can get rowdy."
Quaint little Korean Village,"This area is walkable from Isadong. You may wish to include this into the itinerary if dropping by Isadong. For direction wise, you may seek assistance from the tourist office. It is about 20-30 mins of walking. Once you reached the Neighbourhood, you see a lot of nice old heritage houses and many being still occupied. There are also some nice cafes hidden in the alley as you walk deeper down. A nice place to explore and have a cup of coffee in the nice cafes over there."
A lovely place,"I think it is a little bit far away from Metro, I suggest you can take taxi to get here. It is a residential area, so please keep quiet."
photo worthy place,"those traditional houses are really unique. need to be quiet when you're there, as there are families living in it.nice to just take a walk there. "
A good stroll frozen in time,"If you are looking for a no hassle Korean culture experience, Bukchon is a good place to start. Here, you can soak in the views of Korean living frozen in time. Walk the streets and enter permitted quarters that shows the interior of the hanok homes."
"Similar to the ""French Quarter"" of New Orleans and equally charming!","We came here after visiting the Changdokgung Palace nearby.A very good Thai Restaurant is located in a basement on ""Bukchon-Ro"", about 1/2 way down the street. It is called ""In The Mood For Love"" Thai Restaurant. We had a wonderful meal there. We also got to see an original Hanok on that street, it has been turned into a museum of sorts."
Nice Korean village,"Nice old buildings. Many of them now functioning as guesthouses, galleries, cafés etc. Quaint charm."
Beautiful But Hilly,"It's a great place to go for a stroll, but just be weary that there are plenty of hills in the area to get to a nice view point"
Lots of tourists,Very nice to see the different houses and styles and craftsmanship. Seems like a very expensive neighborhood nowadays. Lots of embassies in the neighborhood. Walking distance from the great palace . Nice places to have coffee and/or lunch. 
Thanks for preserving this piece of Korean history!,"Delightful walking up and down Bukchon. Should have joined a tour that includes going inside one of those homes, if that is even available."
Worthwhile activity subject to your expectations,"Personally, I went to Bukchon for the hanok style houses. I found them less impressive than the glossy photos in the Bukchon brochure, let alone they are hard to find! Having said that the quarter is very charming and I loved the little restaurants that are tucked away in all those little alleys. Best to go there late afternoon so you can take a few pictures and then have proper Korean dinner."
Great traditional homes,"This area has some beautiful traditional homes. The architecture of the homes, walls and streets is well maintained. We were able to step inside one of the homes to see the inner courtyard and rooms. The hike to the top of the hill is worth it as you get some incredible views of the downtown area. The pictures are beautiful with the well-kept traditional homes and the big city skyline in the background. It is important to be mindful of the fact that people still live here and to be respectful of their privacy and space."
Not bad,"If it is hot, there is not a lot of places for shade. There are a lot of places to eat and souvenir shops which is convenient. However the Chinese tour groups are very noisy and distracting. It's a nice area to walk around but try not to go in the middle of the day when it's hot."
Korean traditional house. Hanwok,"It is a village of hanok. Cause it is on the hill,you can see seoul sightseeing view. Nice place. But there are lots of people"
Great but......,"Great, ancient looking building/ houses! However many Chinese tour groups (the people are so embarrassing- talking super loud!!) no wonder there are so many signs written in Chinese to tell them keep the voice down!!"
Nice walk around,"This is a lovely area to visit right after the palace as it is close by and you can walk then on to Insadong. There were little streets with many tourists, but overall quieter than other tourist areas. The houses were nice to explore from outside but would have rather had a guide or more info as background rather than just walk around. "
Lovely place yet too crowded ,We arrived in the late afternoon with our tour guide and the place is crowded. Even though there are signage to keep our voices low but the tourists around were too excited and noisy. We felt bad for the people whom really stay here. Luckier our toddler were asleep and we had a quick snap of photos. Don't miss the past president house and Yido cafe. Is a quiet place for a good coffee and you may be tempted to buy some korea ceramics at Yido cafe.
Lovely walk along charming traditional homes.,"Possibly one of the nicest areas of Seoul. The walk offered lovely and charming cafes, small boutique shops and galleries. Do remember to check out murals and a view of rooftops. "
Beautiful architecture,the houses were so beautiful and well maintained. nice stroll around the neighborhood but some roads may get to steep.
Nice looking houses,This is the place where all the old traditional houses are located. We stayed in one for 2 nights and enjoyed the experience very much. Most of the houses are very well maintained and great looking. The place can get quite crowded in the late mornings and afternoons with tourists. Best to come early morning.
Average for me as all those nicely deco house need to pay in order to have a look inside!,I felt that this place is over-rated for couple like me. We like to see cultural things but the price to pay for visiting their home is like a little bit over.
Bukchon Hanok Village,Nice peaceful village.A must if visiting seoul to see the experience the traditional culture of Korea.
Bukchon Hanok Village,It was pretty easy to get there by train. The village was ok at best. We didn't get a chance to go into any of those tourist handicraft places and just walked around to see the different houses. Can certainly give it a miss if you are rushed for time.
Just houses but not that old looking,"I went here for the old traditional house but the place did not really match my expectation.Yes, there are houses, but it does look that old. It is a hilly walk up so may be i havent walk far enough to see the good thing. "
Great for photo-taking,"Great for photo-taking as this is one of the last few original villages in Korea! There's a free museum to show you how it looks like inside and a few locally-run stores along the path. Other than that, nothing much else to do! Do keep your voices down as people still do live in the houses. Crowed with lots of people squeezed onto a small upslope path."
Cute but small,"We rented hanboks and went there to take pictures. Was expecting a big village but I think it was just a small area. May be we didn't get to explore the entire place. It's still worth checking out, and it's right next to the Gyeongbokgung Palace."
Great photos but you'll be done within an hour,"Bukchon is extremely picturesque and makes for a great backdrop in your holiday photos. This is especially true if you've rented a hanbok for a day!That said, you'll probably be done within an hour since most houses in the area look fairly similar. A possible itinerary goes as such: Gyeongbokgung Palace - Bukchon - Changdeokgung Palace. Get ready for lots of walking though!"
Last of an Era,This neighborhood has the last of the original houses of Korea. I found it fascinating as much of Seoul has high-rises and modern buildings. It's residential mixed with retail. Lovely homes provide insight into the history of Korea. Don't miss the smaller family-run shops and restaurants intertwined with the homes.
a bit disappointed,"probably due to too many tourist at the scenic area, can't really get nice photo, and is a bit tiring to walk uphill also"
immerse in the traditional Hanok village culture and enjoy the modern bric-a brac,"Bukchon literally means North Village, traditional architecture of Hanok village where some Seoulites still live or conduct their business/cafe/restaurant.A very pleasant quaint eye opener into the past, there is that magic that is missing in the modern concrete jungles in most big metropolitan cities.Very easy to get to with the metro system, be prepared to spend a few hours even if you do not like ""shopping"".Stop for a meal in the old Hanok shop or coffee in a modern setting, admire some of the local creative and artistic wares.The prime minister's residence is just nearby, you can't miss it where so many friendly and polite police in uniforms standing around, I feel safer there, I did not see any machine guns! "
Interesting village that everyone should pay a visit !,Interesting place with mixture of Modern and traditional chic ! You are allow to take photos everywhere but please do not disturb the locals as the old houses are still occupied by the locals.
Cute but touristy!,Cute little preserved 'village'. Most houses have been converted into little boutiques and cafes. Has a very hipster vibe though. Its right next to Gyeongbukgung Palace. So club it with the trip there. Schedule it in the afternoon or evening so you can either grab lunch at the little dimsum bar with the longest queue or for a little cafe time. 
Quaint precinct with interesting food places and shops,"Definitely a must-visit! Been to Seoul twice in 2016, and went to Bukchon area four times - just beautiful. We had a walking tour the first time, and went back to dine and walk around more. A place suitable for families, the romantic and just friends hanging out. "
Lovely Streets to explore!,"We really enjoyed walking in the cool springtime air in Bukchon. The little shops were interesting and offered a lot of handmade jewelry and accessories, clothes, nice cafes and we stumbled upon a small flea market with a few unique stalls. Bought a perfume stick 15g for 7000won. We took nice photos with the interesting backdrops of the houses and cafes and even saw many lovely cherry blossoms trees. Enjoy and chill. "
Pleasant stroll,"This neighborhood is very pleasant. Nice views, old houses, nice coffees and small museums or shops everywhere. Very different from the rest of the city. No longer very authentic though but still a good idea for spending a couple of hours"
quaint and charming,we enjoyed our casual walk. The surrounding area is fun for eating and shopping as well. Fun afternoon destination. 
Hipster yet traditional!,"This quaint street gives you the hipster yet traditional vibes. We went by after Gyeongbokgung, there's this small corner stall that sells chicken skewers. MUST! (Short queue for it as they cook it on the spot) You can get some unique pieces here, totally different feel from myeongdong!"
Takes you back to the culture of Korea,the area is a bit walking around 10 minutes from Anguk Station. uphill on some parts. it lets you see the way of life / houses of the past. there is also commercial area. you know that you are near the place cause of the many tourist and there are people that are around to ask question about the area. it is a private street so we have to be quiet at all times.
Old neighbour,A street of old neighbourhood. You would need to walk about 15 minutes plus to reach there. Basically just an old alleyway that still retain old architecture. If you into architecture of common folk in olden days then this is place you want to go
Traveling back in time,A very interesting area to visit the houses has an amazing architecture some gift shops are available with good prices.
interesting,"crowded at some spots but i joined a walking tour and received a thorough explanations on how they lived in the past. walk around the district, it's HUGE. "
Back to 13th Century Old Korea,"We really enjoy the up and down hills stroll in and around Bukchon Hanok Village. All the beautiful view points is within walking distances.At the corner of each streets in Bukchon will have a map indicate your 'Location Now' will help tourist to know where to go next. The view was wonderful, and you can get to see young and old wearing the colorful Hanbok beautifully posing for nice photographer. Please be more considerate when you are in this area, the residence dont mind that we tourist admired this ancient village but they are very annoyed with the noiseness some tourist make despite been warn by the tour guide, tour leader and shamefully by the locals there. This area easily took us 2-3 hours for a stop for photographing, visiting the tea house and museum. Best time to visit this area is when the tour group are not around, maybe early morning and after 5pm. This is not a nightlife area, so if you are looking for a peace and quiet accommodation, here! We choose to stay in one of the hanok to experience the lifestyle and have more time to spend in Bukchon. I encounter many friendly locals who kindly show and give you good directions when we loss track."
Walk around old Korea ,"Pleasurable walk around small alleys and traditional Korean style homes. There is a lot of small shops, restaurants, cafes and places of interest throughout as well as really nice panoramic views of Seoul.Excellent place for a little walk around with some gems scattered about in between."
beautiful views and architecture,"go early in the morning to miss the tourists. Beautiful buildings, gardens and architecture, wonder enough and you'll get a good view of seoul and find a street full of street food for a snack before moving onto the next location."
Pleasant to explore ,I'm not one for shopping so I can't comment on the many boutiques dotted around. However the setting is perfect for strolling around. If you pop into a tourist information office (easy to find) they can provide you with a map with an easy to follow walking route through some of the more beautiful areas. Besides the buildings there are also some good views of the nearby vistas. This is a good place for photos. 
Beautiful,The whole village looks really beautiful. I don't know where i can find houses like those anywhere else. I'm so glad i got the chance to visit this place. A must see!!!
Lots of walking and scenic view,"A lot of walking in Bukon village to enjoy the heritage site. You will enjoy the site if the weather is cool and not hot. However, do prepare a good walking shoe as there are many up hill and down hill route. "
Well preserved history,"When you visit Seoul you must visit Bukchon to experience that part of the history, to see the architecture of the past. Best is to take the subway or bus to Anguk station as start/end of your walk through that neigbourhood. There is suggested route through the area that you can follow through the signs. On your way there are various local restaurants to try their typical local food. You won't regret the visit and there'll be many views to take memorable pictures of Hanok style houses."
What a charming old village,Ok don't be mistaken - this is not some ancient village that tourists come and see what life was like in the olden days - people still live here!! And the olden houses are still very well maintained. No wonder it was said that tv dramas would be filmed here now and then. You can also see many locals or tourists dressed in traditional korean costume and taking pictures. If you think you want to skip this for whatever reason - DON'T!! It's a charming place that you have to visit and you would definitely be impressed how the area has been maintained even in this time and age :-)
Well worth a visit,"This is a great place to stroll around and see some traditional Korean architecture. But get here early to avoid the crowds, especially if, like me, you want to take photos of the buildings without hordes of people in them."
Historical Korean homes. Living architectural sight,Nice to view historic homes but more a tourist attraction. Not a whole lot to do in the area. Gift shops geared toward tourists. Lots of small shops and cafes too.
Enchanting streets of the past,"Thoroughly enjoyed our tour of bukchon. We spent the morning exploring samcheongdong, which was a good blend of modern buildings housed in refurbished old buildings. The streets were really pretty. In the afternoon, we moved on to do a guided tour of buchok hanok. We saw many quaint and well preserved hanok. Our guide was wonderful and shared many stories with us on how a hanok was built and life in the buchon."
A glimpse of the past,"A selection of shops, crafts tea rooms and interesting houses, definitely worth a couple of hours. There are some nice traditional tea and coffee houses - they charge more than most but have much more character and serenity than the 100s of Starbucks that have sprung up in the city "
The Way It Was,To find this island of tradition in the middle of an exploding Seoul was a nice experieince. The wooden houses that once were all over Korea can still be seen here in this living museum.
One of my favorite place in Seoul,"One of my favorite place in Seoul, been there many times, this is a lovely place to have a walk (really liked the traditionnal korean houses - hanok), near Insadong and the royal palaces that you can visit in the same day.It can be a bit crowded that is why I recommend you to go there on weekdays and especially in the morning cause it even more enjoyable where there is few people in the area"
"experiance some ""oldschool"" Korean culture and traditions","This beautiful Hanook village (traditional Korean housing village) is really beautiful. The buildings are well maintained and the activities on offer for tourists are fun to do and see. This area however, is a residential area and so when walking through it you need to be aware of that and remain quiet. It is worth a visit though!"
Beautiful Hanok Houses nested inbetween modern buildings,The Bukon Hanok Village is located beside SamChongDong and is alittle complicated to find if you are heading there via SamChongDong. My partner and i spent quite a while trying to find that famous down slope photospot of the hanok houses. There are also tea houses located within the village and it is an interesting place to visit after visiting GyeongBokGung and SamChongDong shopping belt. 
Quaint neighborhood,This was a really cool experience. All they pushes looked beautiful. It was as if you went back in history just strolling through the neighborhood. It's still houses real residences so we tried to be quiet as we walked through the 8 viewing points. But here is a cultural center that where you can experience making Korean crafts for a fee. I would highly encourage looking into this and making reservations. We saw some people wearing hanboks walking around and it turned out to be tourists that rented them for four hours so they could stroll around in those beautiful dresses as they went through the neighborhoods!!! Way beautiful... They indicated that the rental place was near the subway station! It's best to go to the tourist kiosks to inquire :)
Only if you plan on visiting the hip surrounding area as well,"It is a hanok village with its' peaceloving residents. If you do visit: mind your manners (must say that even the locals were quite noisy while visiting the area). What draws locals to this area is not the hanok village but the trendy surrounding area with its boutique shops, cafes and trendy restaurant. "
Stepping back in time,"I found it amazing that in the middle of an ultra modern city, this gem exists. It truly feels like I have stepped on the set of those Korean dramas my father in law watches! Alongside quaint shops and cafes, this is truly a relaxing side of Seoul that I would highly recommend to all. "
Visit Early and shhhh,Visit the place very early to avoid crowd of tourist. Its best also to mind your noise since this is a residential place. Too bad a lot of posters are in their doors already because of noisy visitors but there are houses with camera badge for picture taking.
Not worth visiting ,"This is a small residential area full of small, traditional Korean houses. Basically, you follow a stone path up some alleyways past some doors of about 100 small houses. Then, the path ends and you're back on normal Seoul city streets. Not much to see here."
Beautiful neighborhood ,Really nice and Beautiful neighborhood. Typical construction that we could only see in this part of the city. Almost rebuild but still nice to walk and see. Be prepare for some hills...
Busy place with tourists,We went on a free walking tour that is organised by Seoul tourism. Our guide was good. The area is busy with lots of tourist but the Hanoks are beautiful. Some of the streets are really pretty but it's hard to get a good picture. Maybe going at the end of the day might be better. The streets can be steep. Everyone that visits Seoul should visit here. It's not a museum it's a real neighbourhood.
Lovely little streets,"This was a fascinating area to visit; very busy on a sunny Saturday afternoon.There are little streets with pretty little houses.In the surrounding area are a myriad of cafes, sweet shops, street food and the like.On week-ends (and maybe week days), the locals (especially the girls) like to dress up in traditional Korean costumes and have their photos taken. There are hire shops that cater for this (but I gather they don't hire shoes - they were all wearing Nikes and the like!). Apparently, they can get into the various Palaces for free if they are in costume. Most are delighted to have their photos taken by or with foreign tourists - I don't mean cynically, but they want to be noticed - that's the whole point of dressing up. Even children get into the act. And there are plenty in the Bukchon Hanok Village area, making for great photos.I had a great time here."
Long walk.,"Took us a while to find this place, and there's lots of steep roads to negotiate when you are there. But strangely, it's a pretty enjoyable place to visit. Maybe because of the unique houses or the nice cafes along the narrow streets. Worth a visit."
A visual definition of South Korean tradition.,"It is best to go to the Tourist Info Center 1st to get maps & ask which site to go. It is a huge area to go around. There are 2 main sites to see with traditional houses & museums around the area. It's quite a long walk so wear a comfortable walking shoes n hats as well. Most of the hanoks are private houses still being use by the locals so a lot of them are close and only the exterior of the houses and the roof tiles are available as photo ops. Some houses choose to open to visitors for workshops showing off kite making, lacquering, knotting, embroidery, and the hanbok. Thumbs up!!!"
cafes and Hanok watching,Definitely a busy spot for Japanese and Chinese tourists. There's some interesting Hanok architecture and even great cafes there too. A lot of hills and winding paths. Bring your most comfy shoes and try to be polite to the house owners.
A peek into the traditional villages,"Well, only if you are into that sort of thing. It's quite a track and it's rather hilly. As the village is actually residences, you won't be able to see much except the streets and the outside of the houses. You will also see numerous (read: in your face) signs to keep your noise level down so as not to bother the residents there."
Traditional homes preserved,"This would not be my top ten list in terms of the must-sees in Seoul. If you have many days in Seoul and you have already done what most tourists do...perhaps then. It gets quite crowded since all the Chinese tourist groups stop here. Besides the traditional homes, there are a few good restaurants including a thin pizza place which is well-known to locals. There is also a specialty department store which specializes in ceramic pieces, although quite expensive though but they do have memorable pieces."
House watching •••,"be prepared to walk a lot of uphill& ve a good pair of walking shoes , best wear Loafercoming here just to see Korea old buildings "
Historical and Traditional,This is a great place to stroll through to see Korea as it used to be. The traditional architecture is so beautiful and the location near the palaces is very convenient.
Don't miss Baek In-Je house museum,There's a lot of retail and restaurants in this old quarter of the city but one can still find some traditional design structures. The Baek In-Je house provides a very good glimpse of the old designs. Not far from here is a samgyetang ginseng chicken soup restaurant which I found to be quite nice.
"Traditional houses, traditional food, traditional clothing","This place is good for tourists who like to experience Korean traditional culture. You can hire hanbok here and walk around the area. Lots of korean traditional houses around, good for pictures and lots of korean food around, we just tried random restaurants and they serve the best kimchi jiggae! "
Good for a stroll,"This place is huge. We couldn't finish walking (with children). We also lost our way and a nice local guy showed us the way. There are restaurants and some serve really great food. However, they are really serious about having their own lunch that they do not serve guests at certain times. The traditional houses are very beautiful and they look really luxury. We went to a traditional hanbok clothing shop and rented them for photo-taking. These are real hanboks made of silk and really very beautiful. It was a real original Korean experience in Bukchon."
Old-time Seoul,"Yes, this area is about all the relentless process of modernisation has left behind when bulldozers and developers transformed former residential areas into glass and steel skyscrapers. Today, the residents of Bukchon no longer fear property tycoons but hordes of chinese and southeast asian tourists who flock the area they know as shooting sites of korean soap operas. The neighbourhood posted signs calling for ""silence"" and restraint. If you can overcome the moral quarrels and decide to be just one of these tourists, the trip to Bukchon is certainly worth your while, as it provides you with a last chance to experience the special charm of traditional Korean residential architecture. The area also offers plenty of relaxed shops and Cafés. You may combine a trip to Bukchon with a hike to the old city wall up the hill offering excellent views overlooking Seoul. "
Great place to experience Korean Culture,"this place had Korean traditional houses and beautiful view. a great place to experience some history+tradition! But I gotta say, I surely did walk a lot!"
Short capital visit,"First thing we wanted to see is the old, authentic area of Bukchon. And it's well worth visiting. Lots of small coffee shops that makes you feel warm and welcome."
Very Interesting Site,The whole place has an authentic traditional feel to it and brings you back to ancient Korea times. There are a lot of traditional crafts to try. Excellent place to go!
Highlight: cultural experience,"I was able to rent a hanbok for 10,000 won ($10 estimate) for one hour. Compared to the Myeongdong studios offering 5 times than that, this is actually a fabulous deal! The lady who runs the shop was also kind enough to take pictures of me on the 2nd floor studio and she even pointed the way to some of the wonderful photo sights. A definite must-go for all tourists!"
Very traditional. ,Nice place to visit. Very calm. Not much of big shopping center. A lot of small shop selling traditional stuff. Can see teens wearing their hanbok walking around. The street food there can be abit pricey as it's a tourist spot. Get a map so you won't get lost. The visitor center very efficient . Speak English very good.
"Traditional, beautiful, wonderful walk","We decided to walk the area before the Palaces opened in the morning. It is residential so it is important to be quiet and not disturb the families living there. We wanted to do the Bukchon 8 photo spots and had read some blogs about the best way to do this. I assumed the area was larger than it was and we decided to skip spots 1-3. It only took us 10 minutes to walk the remainder so I wish we had done the whole walking tour. We were there around 8, so the streets were empty and it felt so peaceful. "
Traditional Korean Style Streets,"Step back in time to see these beautiful hanok houses, still well maintained and lived in. The area is amazing and well worth it. However it might be difficult for people with mobility issues to get around as there are a lot of steep hills to get up and down."
A lovely area to walk around and take in the sights,The old buildings are well maintained and offer a fascinating contrast to the very modern city centre.
Meh,"It's a residential area made of preserved hanok homes. There is a tourist strip along the main street, and a few renovated homes as cheap museums/arts centers, but other than that it really is a neighborhood. Nice, quiet, and quaint. But not somewhere I'd seek out again. "
Pretty,We enjoyed our time here. Lots of places to take great photos. There's also plenty of shops and restaurants in the area.
Traditional Korean Village,It was a pleasure walking round this traditional village and I enjoyed the architecture. The trendy and traditional shops around added to the atmosphere of this place. Visited an old house which was free and enjoyed looking into the rooms. Stopped to have a lovely Ginseng Chicken soup meal. The view from the top was great and the wall murals were an attraction in itself. I enjoyed the exercise of walking up and down this Hanok village.
"Old North town, from Joseon Dynasty","Very interesting to check out the old town from Joseon Dynasty. Buk chon (North Town) is village with old Koreab traditional houses built around in 1930s. In Bukchon village, there are 8 different spots to check out different views to enjoy the old town."
"If you thought Seoul was only a modernized city, just go here.","This place is well known as Bukchon Hanok Village. Basically, this is the most ""Korean"" part of Seoul as the architecture represents the traditional Korea. This is mostly surrounded by housing, so make sure to lower your voice as most as possible, if you come on the afternoon it may get quiet crowded and busy as Bukchon is located in between Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung and most of the tourists may flow here.Just a quick tip, go to the tourist center located at Bukchon-ro 5-gil to get a map of the village as you may guide yourself with the route that is on the map.Make sure to wear sneakers, there will be hills on the walking route! Also, buy water on the nearest convenience store in order to rehydrate yourself, as this will be probably the only time in Seoul having to exercise.Also, if you time at the beginning of the route make to get a spicy rice cake called Tteokbokki on one of the food stalls to make yourself full a little bit before the walk and hike."
Piee of live history in the heart of Seoul,"Nice traditional village located in the middle of the Seoul. Unforgettable experiance, feel the Korea as it used to be"
Recommend ,"Part if the world heritage .. The houses are scattered, will have to talk little and get lose often but it's enjoyable experience after all "
Confuse Walk,Went there wanted to take nice photos but couldn't find the right spot as what i saw from YouTube and website. Quite disappointed. Might be good if there's sign board there directing us to the right photo-taking spot.
Very quaint buildings and unique,"I was staying in Anguk for business and had a few hours to spare. I was recommended the Bukchon village and was not disappointed! Very quaint, older Korean buildings in a traditional style. Really enjoyed this little 2 hour stroll around..."
Beautiful Area,An area full of traditional Korean houses which have been well maintained. Make sure you wear good walking shoes as it is very steep.
Love the sights!,"I've always been amazed with these hanoks whenever I see them in Korean dramas, so I made it a point to visit Bukchon last December. Wear the most comfortable shoes when you visit, as you will do nothing but walk. Be prepared for the uphill trek, too. The pathways are lovely, and the houses are a sight to behold."
Beautiful ,It is a good place to take photos. Please remember to keep your volume down because there are people living there. We totally enjoyed the view and walking around those houses. 
Traditional Houses,Get the area map from the tourist office in Samcheong-dong; they will be able to guide you on the route on exploring the area. Be prepare to some steep slopes and the traffic. Sign to be quite can be seen everywhere since it's a neighbourhood area. 
Nice walk,"If you fancy a walk and getting the Korean house vibes, this is a nice place to do so. Don't go out of your way, there are other similar places. "
Architectural area,"This is a nice area for seeing traditional South Korean architecture. Be sure to take pictures, but be respectful of the people here as well!"
Old style ville,"Bukchon is the old style ville. you can go there by sub-way. The ville is on the hill, you can go up there and see the high view perspective.Not too much attractive view point, or interesting point. The ville is not too much attractive.The good thing is the food street near the ville, don't spend too much time in this."
To be included in your samcheodong tour,Just rows of houses of the rich with hanok architecture. Make sure you drop by the tourist information office to get great tips. Then connect your walk to samcheodong for shopping and food. 
historic,"i love history and the houses here are just so beautiful. i want to get in to see how it look inside. it is very tiring to go up and down the street. it is uphill and downhill.there are many shop where you can buy clothes and everything.restaurants and coffee shop not to get hungry.when you are up you will be able to witness a beautiful view, just relax and enjoy"
#1 Must Do in Seoul!,"This should be the #1 Must Visit place in Seoul! I enjoyed most this part of city than other places,even more than those palaces. Historic, charming places with beautiful streets,houses,shops,etc.. if you miss this place, be sure that you didn't visit Seoul really!"
Very disappointing,"Very little interest. A few so called typical old corean houses. Nothing to be amazed of. Strongly recommend to skip and visit Namsangol Hanok traditional village instead, absolutely lovely."
Walk up hill and Down hill but worth it,Many of beautiful old houses with some handcraft workshop where you can take a look to their traditional things. People in the village are very friendly and welcoming.
quaint,"Well preserved and interesting neighborhood - a time-capsule place. It's in the middle of a modern city, but you feel like you are in another century. Beautiful views. "
Gorgeous little resi area of pretty old houses,"Everywhere you turn there is a new detail to admire. Really enjoyed Traditional old Seoul. walking around here,"
Better to go on not peak season,"The Area is nice,and the buildings are beautiful, but you may find the expectation and reality of the crowd didn't match. I recommend to go there not on a peak season. so we can get great pictures"
Interesting ,About 15 mins by subway from downtown and a nice traditional place. Lots of pop up stores and skin care shops. Nice view on top of the hill and be ready to walk. Tiring but worthy. If you plan to visit the palace probably shouldn't plan anything else for the day...
Traditional houses ,This place there are a couple of traditional houses kept. Have to walk inside the smaller lanes. However this is still occupied by the local residents so can't go in and visit it. However if wanted to experience the traditional houses there are a couple of guesthouse. Can visit one of the high school located uphill. What a nice atmosphere to study in the school. 
Conveniently located between 2 palaces,"We stayed in a hanok during our stay in Seoul and as such, this place is not a particularly interesting place for us.However, it is conveniently located between the 2 must visit palaces - Gyeongbokgung & UNESCO site Changyeonggung - and offers lots of choices in terms of cafe and eateries. So we headed over to Bukchon after visiting Changyeonggung, took a stroll around looking for an eatery, had a meal there while passing time before the free guided tour time at Gyeongbokgung.It's worth a visit as there are interesting cafes set in their traditional houses to spend a cosy afternoon with friends or a 1 hr stroll in between the palaces but if short on time, I would recommend giving the place a miss."
Best wonder round the city,"Nice for walking around, tea houses, small restaurants, feel of old Seoul. Make it a half a day trip if in the city. So far it was my favourite part. "
Paasing by after a visit to changdeokgung palace,"A straight walk after came out of the cdk palace, we arrived at bukchon museum which is the place one should see first before wondering around the area. All houses that were remained appear to be built of the same type of architeture structure, probably the same peroid.....never evolved? All countries have these remants but some are better than these primitive ones. Not too attractive in any perspective and it has been made too commerical. It was nice to walk for half an hour and hit to some other place."
Must see in seoul,"A great relaxing place for tourists. You can meet up with artists here or view specialty shops. The roads are beautiful, the building historic. The people who live here are so lucky! Get a map because the roads are winding, take lots of photos and wear comfortable shoes"
Great time for your own ,"Seoul is busy, lack of quiet places for your own time. This is the right place. Lots of great architectures and streets with foreigners allow you to be your own. "
Bukchon Hanok Village,The village is very interesting and lovely designs. It has traditional and modern. Then go to Samchungdong for lunch as it is very near Bukchon Hanok Village. This area has many nice cafes to choose.
I love this back in history place in the middle of busy Seoul,This hanok village reminds me of the hutons in Beijing I love the way there is such a relatively big area so well preserve and alive (people live in the centuries old houses) in a quite impersonal city as Seoul. Definitely worth visiting and having a traditional tea in our of the amazing tea houses
Prepare your calves,"You have to pace your walk as this is not a single straight street. You'd have to climb up the hill/street to get a glimpse of the old houses. Note that they have old and new houses there, this is not some historical place protected by UNESCO. It was a nice walk."
Perfect place for any tourists.,"Frankly speaking, this hasn't been a great place for tourists in Seoul. However, now it is transformed to the very perfect spot for any travelers. As it is located just next to two main palaces in Seoul, you can also walk through this place."
Tradition filled street,"Absolutely beautiful traditional Korean houses, Slope of the street makes this place even special and beautiful, highly recommend visiting this place."
Experience Walking Through the Ancient Street!,"Bukchon is an interesting olden residential town with quite a number of eateries, shops and visitors centres there. It is a cool place to take pictures of the ancient looking streets and walking through the steps (there are lots of steps!!) in the cool weather, is nice, I can't say that for summer time though :PWe managed to find cheap hanbok shop which provides Hanbok for rental for photo taking (selfies) at low cost, most of the shops charge extravagantly, and as we have quite a few of us, we didnt want to waste the money, so opt for the cheaper ones. Nonetheless, good experience and we will recommend to anyone who wants a taste of wearing Hanbok :)"
Historical architecture,Walking along the streets of Bukchon Hanok village will brought you back in time. It might be a little tiring as the street is upslope. Do wear comfortable shoes.
"Traditional architecture, nice people, beautiful views","We were just walking around, for a few hours, even if it was very cold and we were freezing. The upside of such weather is that there was few tourists.Buildings are interesting, traditional, many of them have beautiful, detailed paintings on the door. It's nice that people still leave here, you can see children walking back from school, people doing their daily jobs, it's not an artificial place created only for tourists.We were invited by one woman on her hostel's terrace, and could see Bukchon from above. It's quite hilly, so there are many places with a nice view.I would recommend the visit if you want to see some tradition, take a look in the past of common people, not necessarily kings and nobles."
Pretty village. Traditional homes. Noisy tourists.,"Lovely traditional Korean homes. Wonderful to wander (and get lost) around the tiny lanes. Lots of photo taking opportunities. Bukchon is growing in popularity, which means that more and more tourists are heading here. Wish they would respect the residents’ privacy and keep noise levels down. It would also make for a more tranquil experience as they explore this lovely traditional neighborhood."
Traditional Village,Basically this area is good for a 2 - 3 hrs of slow walk. You will see a lot of traditional houses and building.Good for those that like to take a lot of photos during travel. 
2 day stay,One of the best place i considered in Korea.. aside from the preserve traditional look of the place.. i loved the serenity and peace of the place.. it is definitely one of the highlight of our stay in korea
Dont know what the fuss was about .,Went with high expectations and well after a walk from the nearest station of about 10 mins reached the place . . kept on wondering what was there to see apart from small lanes and old houses . . only go if you have nothing else to see :)
Old buildings and small museums,"At least during winter time not very special place, you can access differetn small scale museums with small money and there are some handicraft shops, but during cold vinter day area is pretty quiet. The old building are nice anyway, something not easy to find elsewhere in Seoul. "
Traditional style - up market!,"We went here using the ""hop-on, hop-off"" bus and a walking map. The houses are built in a traditional style with tile roof, masonry and timber exterior walls, masonry boundary wall and heavy wooden gate. The walk is quite long and parts are up hill so wear comfortable shoes, and don't forget to wear appropriate clothing as the full walk is several hours. There are marvellous street vistas and interesting views across the roof tops from the top of the hill.There are many cafes and restaurants for refreshments."
Beautiful neighborhood,"We went to Bukchon on a freezing day, but it was fun experience walking along the street which looks just like in a K-drama. We took place in a workshop to make a traditional book mark. "
Attractive Architecture/ Traditional Building,The buildings are very unique & beautiful.This is a must visit place which reflect the beauty of Korea in a traditional way.
Glimpse into the past,"This place is where one can see the traditional architecture of Korea. A sloppy place to explore, best done in the evening where it is not crowded."
Observe Silence.,"accessibility - goodview - fair.for those who want to have a walk around the city, this is a good place to visit. Noteonly that this is a residential place so please observe silence as a respect to the residence of Bukchon Village. "
"Cute area but very touristy, especially during the weekend","This is a nice area to explore in conjunction with the visit of some of Seoul's palaces. Perhaps not quite as nice as Insadong though to find good food, but plenty of little restaurants nonetheless. It is often very crowded though, so don't expect a quiet traditional Korean village, at least on the week-end."
"beautiful traditional neighborhood, very interesting to explore",We love visiting the Bukchon Hanock Village in Seoul. Get a map & it is easy to navigate. There are amazing traditional hanocks that are open to view. The neighborhood is fun to explore. A beautiful way to see the views of traditional & modern Seoul.
Korean Style House !!!! A must visit in Seoul,Listed in a must visit for Seoul. You must love it. All the area are the korean style house. good for photo and walking but please be silent as it is a residential area. I found that it is quite crowded when I visited and people were speaking too loudly.
Nothing special,"Actually, there are only some houses which still have Korean ancient architecture. However, it seems to me that there are so many tourists, which makes Bukchon quite crowded and I cannot feel the ancient atmosphere here.Some places require to pay money for entrance."
Old Korean Village,"This old korean village are beautiful. there are old houses along the uphill road. Be sure to be polite and don't be noisy, cause there are still people live there."
A beautiful place with nice view and nice people,"We went there in the morning, not so crowded with tourists. Have a nice walk around and visited the traditional korean house. Love those small little lanes, quite environment and fresh air compared with places like Myeongdong & Dongdaemen.They are also some shops along the way selling food and souvenirs.Recommended to tourists."
One of the best tourist visiting places in Seoul city,"It would take 15 min or so to walk from the metro station to the area, slightly uphill. Watch out if you go with young kids or elders, also during winter time too. Kinda cold for the walkBut totally worth it. Historic places but with nice contemporary cafes around. Next to the area, there is a cool and trendy area for young local people (not big brands but nice small shops for all kinda, lifestyle, fashion and cafes).You can spend about 1/2 day there and surrounding area."
"Lots of cute, quirky stores!","Though this may seem like a touristy area, it is filled with great little independent boutiques selling one off clothing pieces, it reminds me a little of Covent Garden in London or Greenwich Village in New York. I love the cutesy cafes and coffee bars - one of my favourite neighbourhoods in Seoul! "
Love it,Stayed here for 4 days. I will definitely stay in this area next time I visit in 2016. In walking distance of some of the main attractions. It's busy through the day with lots of tourists given its a heritage site. 
Peaceful,"If you need a moment to wander in the calm far from the city crowds, it is the perfect place. Really charming."
It FREE...just houses,"Is this a great place to visit? To me, so...so. Is there any interesting thing to see? To me, old Korean houses. Is it worth your time to visit? Do visit if you have the spare time."
What a charming place!!,"I remember watching an episode on running man where the members exclaimed about the beauty of samcheongdong / bukchon hanok village. As I reached the place after walking over from Gyeongbokgung, I understood why even locals love the place. It's simply a charming district filled with rows and rows of hanok style buildings, and a mix of modern looking shops and restaurants. Every turn and angle leads to another path of beautiful shophouses. A very interesting place and I can say it's one of my favourite districts to just wander around, take photos and get lost in the many similar looking alleys. Even the bare trees in winter that lined the streets looked pretty! A pity we were rushing if not we could have explored the place more. There are 9 photo zones, but I didn't have time to visit them. I would gladly visit samcheongdong/ bukchon hanok village again during my next trip and take lots of photos of the beautiful hanoks! It is walkable from gyeongbokgung, changdeokgung and insadong! Topokki sold here is different from the usual, the rice cakes are on skewers. Found the traditional candy, ppopgi here as well and i was so happy! Touristy it may be, but we found some really good buys there :)"
Winding through the serene neighborhood full of characteristics,"My daughter, 9, and I picked up a walking map from the tourist info center. She had fun navigating the place. As it was still a place of residence for the locals, there were many notices put up to remind tourists to lower their volume. Definitely worth a visit to see the old architecture. Highly convenient as it was right smack in the city. Just a little cold in winter. So, if your schedule is flexible, pick a nice sunny day."
Great stroll near sunset,"Great to stroll around the village early morning or near sunset, when all the tour buses have left. You don't need a map, just walk around. All roads lead back to the main road. Respect the quiet, people do live and work there."
A glimpse of the past,"Even though I don't have book knowledge of architecture of any countries, I do love visiting and looking at old architectures in different countries. It just amazes me how different eastern and western architectures are, yet both are really captivating to look at.Bukchon is a must visit to people who visit Seoul, especially if you are interested in history or architecture or both. You would have to be quiet while visiting though since the houses have people living in them. They are not just for display. Best time to visit would be Autumn or Spring."
Unique and amazing neighborhood,"My Korean tutor's husband was our tour guide for a day and this was one of the places we went to because I really wanted to see a Hanok Village. There are a lot of steep hills, and it is tiring (especially since it was HOT) but it was very much worth it. If you get to the top of the hill in the neighborhood, there is a beautiful tea house. I recommend sitting outside on the terrace and enjoy the view while sipping mango tea.We got up there just before sunset. It was so peaceful and relaxing but at the same time very exciting and vibrant. I have never seen another neighborhood like this in any of my travels."
The best place in the City,"In the whole city during my time ther i found myself at everytime walking to here, it is because it's a calm neighberhood, old houses and the smell of wood, don't forget to get this Guide from the Tourist Information and Go to all the mention Spots, you will get the best Shots everDo it in the morning you will be alone there and perfect for shooting, the afternoon gets busy again Enjoy it "
Definite Do,"Bukchon and Samcheon are in the same neighborhood and are worth a trolley about (but not in the snow since some roads are steep). You needn't follow any particular route. I have been many a time and I am still pleasantly surprised by some of the little alleyway treasures. Also very near Changdeokgung Palace, so a good combo. Get off at Anguk Station exit 2"
Traditional Day Out,"Visited Bukchon village after Gyeongbokgung Palace. Lots of alleys to venture into and get immensed in the traditional housing of the Joseon era. While some of these hanok houses have remained as residential quarters, many have been converted to shops, galleries and eating places. "
one of my greatest expereinces in Korea,"I visited Bukchon in my 3rd visit to Seoul, and it was one of the best experiences I had. beautifully maintained classic Korean style neighborhood and must see."
steep slope. good views,this attraction require some stamina to walk. it is situated along a slope and not recommended for elderly (unless the old folks are strong enough to walk up a slope). Views are great with many photo opportunities
So cool,Had a lovely day here wandering around. Great to see the contrast between the big modern city and traditional Korean village. A definite must!
A bit too gentrified for my taste,"Yes, there are still hanok houses here, but most of them have become souvenir shops. I was a bit disappointed. I felt that it had lost some of its authentic charm. But it's hard to find places that are truly authentic nowadays. So, it's still a nice place to visit, but don't expect to see anything other than restaurants and kitschy shops."
"Must see, early in morning best",Avoid the crowds while not getting in the way of those living in these wonderful homes. The architecture of these old homes is most impressive. 
Nice walk around the area with views of traditional houses.,"Visit was interesting looking at the traditional houses, especially in the cold weather where it is less taxing compared to summer. Lots of things to window shop and street side food as well as cafes too."
Great Place and View,This place is a nice quiet town with so many back alleys to take instagram photos. There is a cafe right at the corner that sells sweet potato latte! Please take a map at the start of the walking trail to see which scenic spots to take photos
Not as 'kept' as expected,"Was not too impressed, as neighborhood seems overly refurbished. Was hoping to feel the air of the Josen dynasty architecture."
Traditional Korean Houses,It was nice to see old houses and this village was able to preserved their houses. This is a residential area but they allow the public to roam around and have their pictures taken with the traditional houses as their background. But be mindful with noises as the residents do not like to be disturbed.There's no fee when you visit the village and it is just 40 minutes walk from Gyeongbokgung Palace and few kilometers away to Insadong Market. Don't mind the long walk as the place is very nice for walking. Just enjoy the scenery and the culture that the Koreans has to offer.There is also a shop allowing the visitors to try the traditional Korean costume with a fee at the Bukchon village.
Traditional korean houses,"This places is where you can see the traditional korean houses. Many tourists as well as the locals came to this tourist attraction and took some photos. There isn't anything special except for the houses. As it is a residential place (where some people are living in), you have to be considerate and keep your volume down. There are also some souvenir shops and cafes around. Nice to visit if you are curious or interested about the look or feel of traditional korean houses."
Great place to see,"Bukchon Hanok Village is an area of Seoul that every tourist should visit and experience. I was there on a Friday and some of the buildings were not open for viewing on that day. Fortunately, I got to experience the Korean Hanbok dress and take pictures. That was quite inexpensive. Otherwise, the locals do not recommend eating in this area as prices are higher than average. There are also some nice souvenir and pottery shops along the main street."
Historical neigbourhood!,"After visiting all city palaces don't miss this historical neigbourhood.Good for strolling in galeries, arts, shops, restaurants in the heart of Seoul.No visit to Seoul is complete without this place.Spend here some hours starting early morning and having you lunch as well."
Grab guide from tourist office to locate the traditional houses,Amazing to see the contrast in these traditional houses versus modern houses. Some houses offer photoshoots in traditional hanboks. I liked that food was readily available
Just as traditional as expected ,"If you need to get away from the shopping and modern city Seoul can be, then definitely head to this place. Small roads to fit yourself and a smart car side by side. Hills back and forth so you get a workout. The bugging of this place has little boutique stores and very few craft stores. There is definitely food all around "
See the old Korean houses,"Good place to stroll around, see some old Korean style houses, and shop for some vintage souvenirs. With friends, not really worth visiting on its own, but since it's close to the palaces and Insadong, you can just pass by. "
Folk Village in Seoul,Tradional village with narrow street up the slope from the main road. We saw movie filming when you are walking. Lovely slow walk.
Lovely view of traditional houses,We enjoyed strolling along the small streets of this Korean traditional house village in Seoul. Very lovely to look at. 
Traditional Korean houses,Great place to understand the culture of Korea and take photos of traditional Korean houses (Hanok) in this vibrant city. 
BUKCHEON ,"This place is great and amazing. But, I'd like you to know that if you don't feel hiking and walking a lot, then u should not visit the place because you need to walk a lot and it's very steep. But, because of Super Junior, i visited this place!"
Nice place where they preserved the old residential houses,Nice place where they preserved the old residential houses. And these are 'living' area where people are currently still living there.You won't need a lot of time there but good to see.
visit R coffee along the hilly road,"watching sunset here is one of the most memorable time for me in Korea. sitting in R coffee shop (near the edge of the hill) and had a very nice, heartwarming conversation with So Young-the lovely shop owner. her tea is so good and she boils it 3 times for me :)"
Must go,"You cannot missed to visit Bukchon Hanol Village when you are in Seoul. Basically, Bukchon is a private residential area but the unique thing is their houses are Hanoks (traditional Korean house since Joseon era). These houses has been passed down to generations has underwent minor renovation to suits current lifestyle. most of the houses here are the same structure since Joseon era. A must go. "
Good Early Morning Walk,Came here early in the morning when its not too busy. The streets are narrow and hilly at certain parts. Wear a good walking shoe and be prepared to walk. Many small shops selling interesting touristy things. Enjoy the traditional houses and don't forget to shoot photos. Stop by at Gahoe 2nd Floor observatory for coffee and enjoy the view.
Good For a Half Day,"It was interesting to see the area, with lots of little shops to pop in and out of. I would recommend exploring the rest of Anguk, perhaps for lunch, on the same day, and the nearby Gyeongbokgung Palace"
Well preserved village,"Its a beautiful well kept village, for a reason too. Since its a living village, visitors should respect the villagers, but i dont see much villagers there :). Mostly are tourist taking pictures with cafes, restaurant and convenience shops. Place are kept clean and you always have tourist police in red uniform to guise you."
Nice village but nothing much,"The houses are beautiful , good for photos but that's about it. Not a very big deal. It's a good 15 mind walk from the station...just keep going . There are some coffee houses you can try"
Very Korean,A very interesting place as it shows a traditional houses with alleys leading to more interesting houses. But many tourists do make a lot of noises which they are not supposed to do since there are people living in the houses.
Pretty,"Get out at anguk station exit 2 and just walk straight up the street until you see the information booth. There you can get a map, which I would recommend because you can get very turned around here. They have 8 spots for good photos which are marked on the map. There are also information people in red that walk around and can point you in the right direction. There are LOTS of hills which can be exhausting, but the views really are stunning. I recommend going in the Fall because all the colors on the trees are gorgeous. Must be quiet because people still live in those houses. When you go down the (rather terrifying) stairs of the 8th view, Samcheongdong is right there at the bottom. You can walk down that street to get to Gyeongbokgung. Insadong is also close by. We visited all these places in one day. Bring your walking shoes! Hills! "
Great area. Picturesque,"Great for shopping and cafes short walk from folk museum. We had our toddler in a pram which restricted where we could go as very hilly, but still a nice place to wander and get lost."
Dainty Traditional Korean Houses,"Visit this place early in the morning so you won't encounter noisy, annoying tourists. You'll be able to appreciate the houses more and find some relaxing time while walking around."
short walk from gyeongbukgong palace.,"right after our tour at gyeongbukgong palace, we went straight to bukchon hanok village to see for ourselves how koreans live centuries ago. it was a great learning experience and they were able to preserve something of their past and converted it to modern times. we had a lot of photo opportunities and were able to pose wearing traditional korean costumes(hanbok). use your smartphones to take unlimited photos. they only give you one small colored photo. "
A Historic Area Absolutely Worth a Visit,"We visited Bukchon Hanok Village while in Seoul. It was a highlight of our time there. We found that it was absolutely fascinating to walk through the narrow lanes and alleys of this neighborhood full of traditional Korean homes. Part of the appeal of this area is that this area is lived-in. It is NOT a museum, but a living, vibrant community. People take care of their homes and the streets and alleys are well-kept. Be ready to climb some steep stairs to get there, though. The 'village' is perched on hillsides and as you walk around, you get wonderful views of the village and the modern city off in the distance. If you're up for a strenuous walk and ready to climb flights of stairs to get into this village, you will not be disappointed with your effort. Come and see this memorable village for yourself."
Korean style house,"This area can show you how Korean people lived in 200 years ago. The house is called Hanok, which has interesting structure."
Absolutely charming!,"One of my favourite memories of Seoul! Authentic traditional Korean architecture still used as a residential area, so you won't get touristy stuff shoved in your face on every step. It's quite quiet but surrounded by cool little shopping areas too. "
Good for photography,The whole neighborhood consist of traditional korean houses or hanok. There are volunteer that gave us map showing several location that is the best spot to took pictures. The area is very quiet and calm. Very relaxing
I love this place,"This place is awesome. If you want to see how old korean house style, you can come here.The architecture is awesome. This place is famous place for korean drama shooting. "
loved it here as well,"was with a few korean friends so we went to a lot of places... this was one of them,., my first trip to seoul..but i will be back"
traditional house,"just a few minute walking from anguk subway station and then you'll get there. very nice Korean's traditional house and still clean,but you should be quiet in this place because it's also a residential area. nice place to walk around and get some beautiful picture, and its all free :D"
it was nice to see traditional houses,"Just a few minutes walk from the Changdeokgung Palace is the Bukchon Hanok Village. it was good to see up close what korean traditional houses look like. we also discovered that there are guesthouses or hanoks for rent in this area which we want to try next time!there are lots of coffee shops and food stalls in the area. we went here in the morning before taking the 10:30 am English tour at Changdeokgung Palaceto get to Bukchon Hanok: take the subway, alight at Anguk Station (Seoul Subway Line 3), then take Exit 2"
The old Korean styled houses are beautiful,"If you want to have a look of the old Korean houses, this is a good place. I think they are beautiful. These houses are still being occupied by local residents. You can enter some of these houses by paying a fee but we were able to visit one with free admission. If you are lucky, sometimes you could finnd locals wearing traditional Korean clothes wandering around the streets."
Shhh! Please be quite!,"Korean 's traditional houses on hill,near Changdeok Palace, Gyeongbok Palace and Samcheongdong-gil Nice place to walking around and take nice photography. Visit Bukchon Traditional Culture Center to get a free map and find out more attractions around Bukchon.You can see Namsan Tower clearly, suggest you to visit here on weekday to avoid large tourist groupsAnd because this is and active residential area so please do not disturb the residents and keep quite ^^"
"Traditional Korean Living, Made for Tourists","The Bukchon area is a great peep into the traditional Korean Hanoks, houses inspired by the Japanese style. The best way to tour this is to take the walk from Anguk st Exit 3 all the way up and then downhill till you reach the education Museum then take a right to reach the Korean Folklore museum and then to the Gyeongbokung Palace. Also at the end of the trail you will find a small shop which sells nice Dreamcatchers and Mini Cacti for a good price. Alternatively you could walk straight down across the road from Education museum towards Anguk St Exit 1"
A great area to get a sense of Korean Culture and lifestyle.,"I spent a week in Bukchon and while I did not get to visit all the main sites and attractions of Seoul I think living in Bukchon gave me a real sense of what it's like to live and work in modern Korea. Bukchon remains very traditional in the sense that several hundred traditional houses ( Hanok) and workshops remain so you can spend time wandering through the narrow lanes and a number of buildings offer workshop experiences such as kite making, ceramics, traditional dress ( hanbok) experiences to enhance the cultural experience. In addition I noticed a lot of Korean tourists were staying in houses converted into homestay or guest houses. The area also has strong connections with modern Korea as the streets are filled everyday when workers pour out of the Hyundai office blocks to buy coffee in the many coffee shops ( yes - these do include Starbucks!). Lots of food outlets too offering lots of variety. Sadly a few streets are overrun by tourists ( mainly Chinese) and this can limit the pleasure but there are plenty of times and streets when the coach tours are not there to spoil the sense of being in a living and lively local community. If you get the chance - don't just visit - try and stay in Bukchon."
Great photo opportunities,It's quite a walk uphill but it's interesting to see the houses on our way up. Nice place to take memorable photos of your visit to Seoul
Magical and Worth Seeking Out,"Because of a few mistakes in planning, we ended up spending an afternoon here, and were so glad we did. This is a hidden gem that most visitors on short visits won't get to as it takes some effort and walking. Beautiful architecture, interesting back story, lovely one-off shops and Doo Roo, an exquisite non-chain coffee bar that's so toasty and cozy!"
Bukchon Hanok Village,"Well, the experience was refreshing as this is something that cannot be seen in my home country. I would say the old-style houses are beautiful, but it can be slightly disappointing as that is about it. If you are have want to go there, You actually can as you can do some shopping around the area. It is also near Insadong, where you can do quite alot of stuff as well."
Traditional hanok village,"Worth a visit. This place are so beautiful, quiet and peaceful. We were in spring season, the weather was great and the flowers blooming all over the place. It was green environment. This village mainly filled with old style korean houses and there were cute shops along the street. Stairs were kinda narrow and steep. No need to rush and enjoy the amazing view."
Good add-on to a visit to Chengdeokgung Palace,"An interesting area of Seoul to visit is the Bukchon Village near Changdeokgung Palace. This is an historic neighbourhood where you can find hundreds of Hanoks, traditional Korean style houses, recognised for its unique architecture and structural positioning in relation to the contours of the surrounding land. Here you can walk paved streets, lined with Hanoks, many of which remain residential while others serve as cafes, coffee shops, shops, galleries and a handful of small museums. Seems there are some homestay opportunities in the area as well if visitors fancy staying in a Hanok during their time in Seoul. We found Bukchon to be a good place to stroll and enjoyed seeing the many traditional Korean style buildings. It felt over-marketed and promoted but still a nice place to spend time, especially if you intend to be in the area, visiting the UNESCO World Heritage Chengdeokgung Palace. You can easily explore a good portion of Bukchon for 30-45 minutes before or afterwards. Note: The area where you find Bukchon Village is quite hilly so be prepared for some steep street climbs from time to time."
Nice look at traditional korean home,"The picture that everyone sees of this place is really a small street. It is always filled with people so it's hard to take a good picture. Walking there, try to ask for directions from the volunteers in red. This is a nice place to take a stroll and see a less busy side of seoul. I recommend coming here first before Samcheungdong as you will end up in the middle of that street and you can take a walk downhill"
Quaint but over-rated.,"The streets are narrow and steep and can be confusing to navigate without a map. The traditional buildings are interesting to look at but vestiges of modernity are everywhere, with fingerprint scanner locks installed over ancient looking doors. Over promoted as a tourist attraction, resulting in large number of tourists around, making moving around the place challenging at times. "
Old style houses,"Walking through the street with old style korean houses.it is an eye opener I would say. worth a visit.after that, can visit samcheongdong for shopping and plenty of cafes lined along the street."
Traditional Hanok ,"Walking around in alleys and finding different Hanok houses was interesting. A lot of Hanok have been converted into galleries, cafes or guesthouses. This area is still largely residential. Be considerate when walking around. "
pretty hanoks around,The area is filled with traditional houses (hanok) and is a pleasant walk from Insadong. There are various dining options in the area.
North Village in Seoul,"This village preserves the old shapes of Korea in the era of Joseon Dynasty. Also, there are lots of restaurants specilazed in dishes, cafes, galallies, etc.. Go to there if you want to see Kirean cultures. There are lots of foreigners getting around."
Interesting walk through the hanok houses,"Came to view the hanok houses which are beautifully restored, quite a nice walk from Exit 3 of Angkuk station on Subway Line 3. Can imagine it would very warm in summer but now being winter, the walk uphill was comfortable.Loved peaking into some of the beautiful courtyards housing local businesses which allow you to try on traditional hanbok, take some photos while they shared about the korean culture for a fee or do it like me just walk through the village on your own and let your instinct lead you through the winding paths. There are plenty of cafes, restaurants, shops to keep one engrossed and you can easily spend a few hours here."
Old Style Houses in a HyperModern City - Bukchon,"Loved this place, architecture is so unique and elegant. a Mixture between modern and old houses in this area, lots of coffee, clothing and souvenir shops. Totally recommend for small groups, couples and families (first time visitors mainly). A little difficult to reach and confusing (because is not a Village but a set of streets in a small area....)"
Great free to-do option in Seoul!,"Bukchon area, especially the Hanok Village is a must-visit place IMO. You can walk around, sightseeing, and if you have the map, you can seek for the recommended photo spots and take some insta-worthy shots! Do mind that LOTS of walking is involved and the area does get crowded at times. And because the hanok(s) are private properties and people actually live there, we are not suppose to visit after 6pm, if I remember correctly :) "
Definitely Worth a Walk Through,A great place to walk through and get a glimpse of old Seoul. I toured the Western Gyeongbokgung Palace in the morning and en route to Changdeokgung Palace and Secret Garden I toured through the narrow streets of Bukchon. A great place for photos and many little places to grab a refreshing beverage to quench your thirst or take in a traditional Korean BBQ. Highly recommend Bukchon Village as a destination while in Seoul.
The old rich neighborhood,"Walking around the place, please maintain silence to give privacy to homeowners. Both sides should be visited"
Pleasant & Interesting ,"I spent a pleasant few hours wandering around here. While the traditional houses are interesting, I was happy just soaking in the local flavour and enjoying the delicious street food. Gets quite crowded late afternoons on the weekends. "
Absolute must when in Seoul,"Very beautiful traditional houses, steep lanes, plants and flowers - wonderful ambiance. The fact that people still live there normally adds a very ""live"" aspect to this area. In the part closer to Gyeongbokgung Palace there are lots of cafes, restaurants, art galleries. "
Good break from Seoul city sights,"Best to visit early in the morning because it gets crowded closer to mid-day. Interesting narrow alleys, clean; traditional Koreans houses have beautiful wooden doors. Most homes are private, but there is an interesting compound that is open to the public. Two other sites : National Folk Musuem and Gyeongbokgung Palace are walking distance from Bukchon - interesting 15 - 20 minute walk."
Short trek up hill..architecture,"We took a morning walk from Insadong to the area. Mainly old traditional style houses where people live in -- not a museum but an actual neighborhood. There is a temple towards the top, plus some shops along the day. A place to look for persimmon trees if you have never seen one. Good place for picture taking if you love traditional architecture.Along the way to the area are some museums, souvenir shops, and street food vendors."
Nothing great..(in my opinion),I feel like I would have enjoyed spending more time inside a palace or museum as we didnt get to see the inside of any house since my husband and I did the tour on our own. Seeing a few houses would have sufficed for me! Looks the same anyway hehe. Pretty steep inclines to the best locations so its not recommended for seniors or anybody who is too tired.. 
Traditional House,Beautiful houses. You can see how is korean traditional house is look like. No free tour available. All houses and close and there is sign not make noise. You can enjoy and feel the sourounding and take picture of the house.I
Old times fav,"its such beautiful village, surround with old traditional home korea.you can find many traditional home here, clean place, you can visit for free. if you like history is good place to visit"
Pretty but crowded tourist trap,"Its history is 600 years long, but the area is so well-preserved and so full of tourists, art shops and guest houses etc. that it felt like a very nice walk in the Korean version of Disneyland."
In love with this old town ,"Personally I prefer this to Myeongdong. I could spend the whole day strolling along the narrow roads of this traditional old town, admiring the buildings, houses, rooftops, trying out every quaint little cafes. A must go if u r like me, prefer to have a taste of life at a slower pace. It's like Kyoto in Japan."
Traditional street in the city,Love the place with perfect location of traditional view in the city. Lovely atmosphere to walk around. 
Luxurious Traditional Village,"I can say that this traditional village may be home of pioneer residents in the city. It is only in this village that I saw traditional houses with luxurious cars parked outside their porch.If you are a K-drama fan, you'll find here the gate featured in Lee Min Ho's drama 'Personal Taste'."
Gahoe Bukchon Hanok Village,"This was a very old, traditional part of old Seoul - which stands in stark contrast to all of the large buildings and skyscrapers you see elsewhere in the city. Here you find tiny, traditional houses as they once stood 50 or more years ago. This is not an exciting place to visit - more historical."
Lovely neighborhood,"I think everybody would enjoy visiting this romantic, cozy and beautiful neighborhood. Stroll there to enjoy old times idyllic set up. Take a lot of pics. "
Seoul tour,You will pass by traditionalKorean houses. No other interesting activities. You can try to wear their traditional Korean dress but quite expensive 7000 Korean won!
100 year old traditional Korean house & Korean traditional villsge,"Our taxi dropped us off this 100 year old Korean exhibition house either a scenic overview of the Bukchon village, unfortunately we were not allowed inside the house because we were not with a guided tour. But fortunately they allowed us to enter & view the house from the garden -- to officially open in 2 months. This was a home of a Korean surgeon & now bought by the City of Seoul. Yes it's worth a visit then walk to G-Palace . Ginseng chicken soup Restaurant was our lunch stop in this area. "
"I Really Thought I Would Adore This Place...But, Not So Much","Pick up a map at the visitor's station nearby. Everything is self guided here. Free.*** A small residential neighborhood from the old days with period homes. Nothing more, nothing less.***Wear comfortable shoes/sneakers, for the route is Fairly steep...sometimes with stairs, etc. There are views to be had but hard to find, according to the map. A few guides placed around the village to give directions, etc. Just enjoy what you are seeing. Some folks have opened their homes for a VERY steep admission fee...I would pass. NO places to have drinks or lunch. Go back to the main road, and there are shops and places to drink & eat.Plan on about 45 minutes. You will tire of this place soon.Please give me a heads up vote if this review has helped you or yours. Aloha."
Going back in time,"Interesting area to get a glimpse of how life may have been in the past with respect to the houses. A friendly lady invited us into her home to have a look, which was very nice. We enjoyed our stroll through the neighborhood and finished it with a nice meal in a Korean restaurant."
One of my favourites,"If you want to escape from the heavy urban mood when in Seoul, this could be one of the places to be. Unless it's summer season, Bukchon can be really quiet, especially in the mornings. On busier days there are usually many street musicians and you can also buy some handmade crafts. There are lots of coffee shops, desert cafes, restaurants and galleries around the place. It's one of those sophisticated areas of Seoul, that is always warm, welcoming and a little bohemian. Please note, that it's actually a residential area!"
Traditional Korean houses,"If you would like to see authentic, traditional Korean houses, you should definitely come here! Be prepared, that in will be too crowded, and you have to be super patient if you would take a good photo on the neighbourhood without tourist hordes."
Old house of Korea ,This is an old house places and very interested to visit. Prepare to walk with comfortable shoes and many eating shops are other fashion shops.
Loved it!!!,We reached when its almost dark. We managed to take a few photos. Lovely view. Regret not to come early. I will come back again.
Nice walking indeed,"This is indeed a nice area for walking, a little uphill, but through quiet streets. The houses are old and quaint. Plenty of shops and eating facilities in the direction of Insadong."
A perfect blend of traditional and modern,Samcheong-dong + Bukchon is a must-visit area in Seoul . The Hanok (traditional Korean Houses) and modern buildings blended perfectly and gives this place its unique flavor. There are also many nice cafes in this area.The place is within walking distance from Gyeongbukgung Palace and is easily accessible.
Loved it!,I actually stayed in Bukchon for my first leg of my trip. It's quiet and charming. It's very close to two palaces. The subway is close by. I loved staying in this neighbourhood and walking round. If you don't love the hustle and bustle I highly recommend it for an area of stay. 
Interesting but not really,"Walked around the whole area. It might have been an historic site but currently it is all renovated. There are some coffee shops and small restaurants west of the Gyeongbokgung Palace. If you are willing to walk, stroll south trough Buckchon Road until the Insa-dong area and further south. Nice follow up after the Palace visit, which is a mandatory destination."
"Interesting, but crowded","My husband and I walked around this area on a Wednesday morning and it was fairly crowded. There is a nice small museum set up in one of the houses that you can walk through. The buildings were interesting, but if you only have a short time in Seoul you could skip this. On a side street there were some good views of one of the mountains. There was also a little wine bar and a cafe with a good view of the mountain, but neither were open. I imagine they would have pretty views at night."
"Beautiful, even at night","I had a quick walk through Bukchon village at night in Seoul. My intention was to return again in the daylight, but even in the evening, it was beautiful, and gives a glimpse into the past. The narrow streets and old, well restored houses are a delight to see."
Must visit when you are in Seoul,This is my first visit to Bukchon in my 4th trip in Seoul and it was amazing to see the traditional houses well kept in this quiet neighbourhood in Seoul.
Excellent historic Bukchon Village street walk,"Seoul and Korea are full of history often unknown in the West.On a sunny Saturday, I strolled around the Bukchon Hanok village.This is a wonderfully restored series of hill streets, taking you back nearly 600 years to traditional Korean villages.The streets were traditionally the residential quarter of high-ranking government officials and nobility during the Joseon Dynasty (in the 1400s).Beautifully restored and with expensive residences with great views over the city, the small traditional homes nestle closely together on steep streets.Great to spend time walking, shop browsing and enjoying very good coffee in the numerous Korean-Western coffee houses."
Hanok - Korean traditional houses,You can visit Buchon's street for shopping then go to 31 Gahoe-dong or 11 Gahoe-dong route to view the hanok. Gahoe-dong is up hill and downhill need a lot of walking but the hanok is worth to visit.
Rustic,"This place has real traditional houses where people still live in. Of course they don't still live the olden way. But rather, they just restore the traditional houses and have electricity and water and all the comforts of modern day living. Nice place to check out."
you see the tradition,"Some people complain about lots of shop there. True, lot of those houses have been converted into shops and homestay. However, if you go further into the alley, there are MORE that are NOT been converted, and still keep it original, or even much older. You need to go out of what the ""Map"" tells you. Otherwise, you can only see what a tourist can see. "
Personal Taste Drama Location,if u fan of Lee Min-ho & watch Personal Taste drama this is the place u must come. U can feel korean drama when come here. The location is very beautiful. Tips: please used the correct shoes when walk here as u need to walk and walk and walk & some climb the road.
Don't Miss This Place!,"If you love those scene in Korean TV series, you should not miss this place. You can easily spent your entire day exploring this place, shop to shop, cafe to cafe, etc. Be prepared to wear your comfortable shoe as the terrain there can be quite challenging for some. But the amount of food intake and easily burn-off at teh end of the day. Beautiful place. Must allocate time for this."
A must visit,Walking around the small street of Bukchon is a must when visiting Seoul. It one of the only few remaining locations where you could see the traditional houses.
Quaint and charming neighborhood!,"Took some time to stroll around here in-between visiting Changdeokgung and Gyeongbokgung Palaces. This neighbourhood is extremely charming and picturesque. It’s full of adorable restaurants, cafes, and shops that are a joy to visit. I recommend doing lunch in Bukchon and getting lost in the winding alleys and streets on a leisurely afternoon. "
Beautiful area to walk around in ,"Right between 2 palaces, well worth a stroll around. Interesting to see the modern houses built in traditional style. Cut into the little side street for an 'old town' feel "
Great place for a photo session,"Made a lot of photos of my GF there, place is just great, Very atmospheric. Also can recommend stay there for a night in one of that ancient houses (its available)"
Don't miss this neighborhood!,"Wonderful neighborhood of traditional houses very well preserved. This is mostly a residential area, but surrounded by great shopping and cafes. The building style is ""old Seoul"" and houses have been lovingly restored. Don't even think of driving on the narrow and winding streets - this is a walker's paradise. There is a neighborhood walking tour marked on locally posted maps and an information center that can provide more walk info. This is well worth the time!"
Nice ,"I love the street & old korean houses here..so nice and pretty..It's so quiet because it's actually ordinary residence.the sign of ""silence please"" is everywhere.."
Traditional village with hanoks.,"Paid this a visit and it was worth it to see the hanoks which are a rarity in modern Seoul. There are specific photo zones (on the ground) that you can look out for to get the best angle for your photos. Is a popular spot for couples in every season, and there are traditional activities you can take part in, just do some research online. Since this is a residential area, visitors are reminded via signs to keep the noise level down in the neighbourhood. "
What's the big hype?,"Really? What's the big deal? Yes, you can see the glimpse of old neighbor hood, but it really didn't do it for me.I definately would not recommend people, i'd rather visit one of the palaces."
Poor Direction & Changing Landscape,"We were disappointed. It took us a good 20 minutes walk from the Gyeongbokgung Palace to get to the village. There were hardly any proper directional signs to lead us there and we had to ask along the way for pointers. When we arrived, instead of seeing hanok, we were greeted by a changing landscape of modern houses mixed with whatever is left of hanoks. What remained were converted to guests house. "
Great view! Recommended place!,"If you have a map of Bukchon (easily google it or you can ask a map from their tourist guide dressing in red clothes), there are 8 spots you can visit. Because of our strict schedule, I only manage few spots here but I am satisfied! The view was amazing. This road is in uphill so prepare your foot! You can rent a hanbok in Bukchon Museum, right before you turn left to downhill (check your map!). The rent is cost 10000krw. It's expensive but worth it! The color is so pretty and you can wear it outside and enjoy Bukchon for 30minutes! If you want to go to Insadong, you can visit Insadong after Bukchon just by walking and chill the road. There are a lot of cafes, restaurants, and stores! Watch your wallet, ladies! Hihi Just easily check your map to see the direction from Bukchon to Insadong. It's easy to read, don't worry!"
Beautiful Hanok and interesting shops,"The traditional houses (Hanok) were really beautiful and many interesting shops lie within the little aisles. Do note that this is a residential area and minimise the noise level as it will affect the residents. There were guides from the tourist information centre who walk around to assist the tourists. No smoking is allowed and the guides will ask you to stop smoking if spotted, which I appreciate as non-smokers do not enjoy their experience at this beautiful village being tainted by the smokers. Be prepared to walk lots of slopes and stairs. You can get a map from the tourist information centre, the staff were really friendly there. "
Interesting to explore!,My husband and I really enjoyed our walk here. There are so many interesting traditional houses to look at and the view during sunset was amazing. We went during the weekdays and off peak season so there were not many tourists around.
Amazing and well kept Architecture of oldday houses,"The traditional architecture of the old day Korean house were well kept since it was under the World Heritage property. A slow walk up hill will get you amaze with the different design of the house, roof and the wall design. A must visit for 1st time visit to Seoul."
Nice old village,If you want to see the old traditional houses and streets you must visit this. Be aware of some steep streets but worth it. If you follow the route then you will see most of the old houses. Also in some houses there are exhibitions or workshops or you can wear hanbok and take pictures.
Good to see,"This is great to see as part of a day exploring Seoul. However, I would not do this all day or plan a trip around this."
my favorite place in Seoul,"So much on offer, great café scene, hidden Korean eateries and lot's of culture. If you have little (or lot's of) time and like to absorb some the old and new Korean feel, it is the place to go"
Very traditional ,I've always wanted to see the various styles and it was quite quiet when I visited. The views are also good from the vantage points. Unfortunately I wasn't able to look inside a house but they looked really quaint from the outside.
Really lovely little place to walk around,"We love this place , cute buildings old history and design but still nice modern shopping and food outlets , old houses have beautiful timber work , and the old tile roofs are amazing , do yourself a favor and check them out !!"
2 many ppl ,Great to see the traditional houses still in korea Heard this place is famous as well because alot of the houses are in korean dramas I must say theres too many people here to even take nice photos tho 
Beautiful place,Bukchon 8 views are so interesting and worth to take a look. Avoid going there during weekend or holidays as the place will be very crowded.
Go early at morning!,"Our guide, Gene, from ""This Is Korea"" Seoul tour company, took us to Bukchon first thing one morning of our Seoul tour. We loved the fact that few people were on the streets yet at 8:30 a.m., and photos ops were fantastic!"
Charming lovely place,"A very charming and rustic neighbourhood with a great variety of restaurants, cafes and little nice shops! Good to shop and stroll, with very traditional houses. It's like a wanderland away from the busy and crowded shopping district of Myeongdong."
"Just keep wandering around, you'll find pockets of historic beauty","The two best pieces of advice in visiting Bukchon are: Ignore many of the “recommended walk routes” you find, particularly in guide books. They would be better called “If you walk in and around this general perimeter we’ve laid out, you’ll see Bukchon”. Go to the “Images” option of most search engines and type in “Bukchon”, you’ll find alternative, much more detailed (and perhaps better) walking route maps. Get an early start (getting to Bukchon by 8:00 – 8:30 A.M. is recommended). The area is surprisingly small and the streets very narrow. By 10:00, it’ll start to fill up with mini tour groups and other tourists with cameras to the point that any pictures you take will be mostly of other people taking pictures. This is especially true for the north-west section of Bukchon. [If it’s just you and the occasional resident walking their dog or walking to school, you’ll know you’re there at the right time]. If you’re staying close by, it might be a good idea to visit it until crowds start to show up, then leave and pick up where you left of the next day.Finally, not to be preachy but keep in mind that you are, for all intents and purposes, in these people’s front and back yards. "
Charming Bukchon,"One of my favorite destinations in Seoul. It was crowded when we were there, but worth our efforts, time. You get to see the old streets and you seem to move back in time. A must see! I would definitely go back there - probably early in the morning."
Old village in the middle of city,"located between gyeongbokgung palace and changdeokgung palace. it's a unique area where traditional and modern meets. you can either go shopping, eating or just walking and seesighting. most of the store have a chic design make the street looks even more unique and beautiful. very lovely. bukchon have a lot of korean traditional restaurant and also you can't miss the food street. The most popular spot on bukchon is Bukchon Hanok Village, is where you can find korea traditional houses in the middle of Seoul. awesome!"
Very nice area to hang out! (Though don't expect something amazing),"Pretty beautiful area to hang out, and see the different architectures. Don't expect something that'll blow your mind though :) some nice cafés and restaurants. Dedicate easily 1 hour to walk around there."
Very calm and authentic experience of a Hanok Village. Great photo opportunities!,"This is still a residential area, with some cafes and shops. So, not that commercialized like Namsangol Hanok Village. A lot of great photo opportunities."
My most memorable place in Seoul,"Beautiful! This is definitely less crowded than Myeongdong. Many interesting and creative shops, workshops and cafes around. Best photo taking spot! Love this place! "
Picturesque like back to the old time,"Picturesque! A nice tranquil walk in the residential area, i feel like I'm back to the old times. But this tranquil walk can become very annoying if there are few groups of tour surrounding you. Since I'm going there free & easy, I just let them walk in front of me, so that i can have some peaceful walk and some nice pictures. "
Takes you back in time!,Bukchon Village was truly incredible and I was able to experience what life used to be years ago. As you visit you're required to speak on a minimal tone of voice to not disturb the people living in the area. Within the village you will be able to find souvenirs made by the locals. 
Must visit,On a sunny day this place is a must. It has been the highlight of our stay in Seoul. Awesome atmosphere very well preserved area gives you a very nice feeling of relaxation and how traditional areas looked like
It could be the highlight of your visit,"A quaint little village with a community feel. (now gentrified) The houses are done with tiled roofs and stone in narrow alleys. You could easily spend the whole day walking around here. There are some cute shops, good food, pancakes were yummy, coffee, etc THere are a lot of tourists and locals on weekends. But hey, everybody wants a piece of history to soak in, right? It is also very close to the palaces. We stayed in one of the houses - Hanok style houses and it was easy to explore the area. The family we stayed with were very kind and cheerful people. The room itself was a bit disappointing. We expected a little original (after having stayed in a similar type of house in kaesong, in North Korea) but they seem to have plasticised stuff. So it felt a bit synthetic. There could be other homestays that are possibly in its original state. THere are museums and various tours that you could do. There are also cyclos that take you around the area, highlighting the important landmarks."
A great area to visit,"Bukchon is a a neighborhood close to the palace. From a very busy street, you take a turn towards Bukchon village and suddenly you are between low rise, old houses in small streets. Many small shops and not the ones that sell the same souvenirs. No, each shop has its own fingerprint. A very nice mix of modern and traditional."
A glimpse of traditional villages in Korea,One place that I would hope to visit again someday. It gives a cultural glimpse of the old life in Korea. The houses and streets are clean and quaint. 
Very interesting,"You can find a map of this area in most places. If you walk up the road next to Changdeokgung Palace you will reach the traditional houses. You can then make your way back down through the area, which has lots of cafes and traditional restaurants. It is between the 2 palaces."
Old neighborhood in a modern city,I recommend taking a coffee break there. It is a nice neighborhood with old houses next to the palace. A nice view of the city and lovely houses done like in the old times. Tourists information guys are at the entrances and will offer you an explanation and a map to a self tour with the mail attractions ofbthe neighborhood
Lovely experience,"I visit this place so many times, and every single time the experience proves to be different. On days when you're lucky, there ain't that many tourists or students, so you can roam around in peace while making the most out of the rustic ambience. Do give the croquette shop a try (there's only one along the way so you will definitely spot it! :))"
peaceful slice of history,"walking around this area is so delightful, taking you back in time through the winding streets past the traditional houses. there will be lots of other tourists walking as well, but somehow it is still peaceful as mostly car free. This area is easily accessible and you can combine it with Insadong or the Folk Museum. Take your camera and follow the online TripAdvisor walking tour, or pick up a brochure from the tourist hotel."
It is nice to walk around and feel the culture,although it is a distance (around 1km) from subway and need to walk uphill. It is worth to go there and walk around so you can see the old style houses and feel the culture. scenery up there is nice which you can see folk museum from top view.
Lovely stroll in a traditional Hanok village,"This provides an insight into the traditional Korean Hanok housing. Highly recommended to take a stroll through the many and little alleys for a close look at the Hanok housing. Don't be afraid to walk through the alleys which can be rather quiet. A few of these housings have been turned into commercial with homestay hotels and shops. So do take some time if you wish to take a glimpse of the interior of the Hanok houses.It is a real hilly walk at some areas, especially at Bukchon-ro-11-gil but at that highest point, you get to see the rooftop of the Hanok housing...real beautiful.Wear good shoes/ sneakers."
It's ok,"If you like traditional architecture, here you would be looking at the traditional houses of Korea, there are even places where they offer lodging korean style. Nice place to visit. There is also the school where they filmed Winter Sonata."
Experienced Traditional Korean Culture,"If you wanna know some traditional korean culture, then you can visit here :) You can also try wearing traditional korean costume and have picture taking :)"
Nice old style neighborhood.,It's a nice to walk around this neighborhood surrounded by old houses. There are a few small museums you can enter for a small fee. The area is very local with very few tourists roaming around while I was there.
Be prepared to WALK!,"Lovely place with traditional Korean houses, but you'll need to walk quite a bit. Good for photography. Nice view :)"
I have mixed feelings.,"I have rather mixed feelings about Bukchon. The area is itself really neat and it's great to walk around. Don't forget to wear your walking shoes because it's uphill.But you'll see listings for all these museums where you can experience Korean culture. We checked one out and were pretty underwhelmed. I felt like we'd been ripped off. We also ate at this kinda fancy restaurant and paid 'way too much. Perhaps it's because beef is super expensive in Korea. Service was great and all, but it was really expensive.Still, if you've got some time, this is a great place to explore."
Where we can see traditional korean house,"Here we can see the traditional korean house, small street left right traditional korean house with some art shops...and cafe in beginning of street....i like this area very much !"
Nice to walk for 15 minutes ,Like the title says. 15 minutes is enough. It's just a suburban area with a couple of authentic but modern renovated....
Worth Visiting,"Bukchon offers a blend of old and new. As you wander the streets you will find very traditional Hanok houses and more modern dwellings interspersed with galleries, shops and boutiques. Samcheong-dong Street also offers lots of trendy boutiques and stores and is great for people watching."
Nice,Its really nice to walk in this village but it can be crowded becuse it is a tourist place so it well be better if you go early .
Cultural walk,A very cultural and interesting to go to.. All the unique designs of the houses and street.. Do visit the place to experience the cultural feel. Will visit again and maybe stay in one of the houses if possible. Wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot of walking to do.
Nice alley,Very nice little alley of traditional houses. Located up the mountains therefore might be tiring to go there with older people.
Pls try Homestay,Visited without staying. If i have a chance again. I will definitely try to the homestay here. It just feels very different and would be nice to experience the korean culture.
A Must to Visit when in Seoul,"A nice and lovely traditional Korean Village! A great surrounding, a lovely area!Nice place for picture taking, go early so you will not have hundreds of tourists in the pictures!"
Wow the old and new,This was a very interesting tour . Some of the old houses are fantastic the streets are narrow and the front doors are a art in themselves . Some of the houses are not so old . People must get annoyed with tourists being there everyday so you can understand way the halls are high and private . Great craftsmanship in some of the buildings . The history of some of them is very interesting . There are a few shops in between like a soap shop jewellery shop and a gift and puppet shop
Historic Village,Its nice to go here on a sunny day when you can walk around and enjoy the beauty of the old buildings. They also have some small unique shops in the area. 
"A lovely traditional village, tranquil and pretty.","Loving this place! Not just the traditional houses, the surrounding area is such a lovely place to visit. I wished that I had stayed in one of the traditional hanok guest houses here, it would have been a good experience. "
"Little to see, nothing to do and full of people and cars","Very disappointing. The photos in the tourist guides looked lovely but the reality was thousands of tourists and because this is still a residential area all the streets and lanes were filed with parked cars (can only assume they were paid to park elsewhere when photos were taken or photoshopped out of the pictures in the guides) we stayed 20 minutes, took obligatory photos and left."
Serene and antiquity,"It was like you were being transported to the time Dae Jang Gyeum, the lead actress in the Korean Soap,Opera Jewel in the Palace, had the chance the wear the Hanbok, charming, I feel like an empress, i got the glimpse of how the past was for the Koreans, their houses was about the same with Filipino houses, "
A walking tour ,Found a free walking tour and went with a very nice lady guide. She showed us all the interesting spots. A nice tour for sure
Cool place to visit,Walking the streets and looking at all of the old historic houses was really neat. I'm glad I just so happen to stumble across this as I was exploring the city of Seoul.
OK but not great.,I was really excited before going but in reality it's just modern versions of old houses in a residential area. Some good cafes and shops in the area but wouldn't go out of my way to go there (I was staying near by).
Visit old Seoul,After a day at the palace take some time to stroll through through Bukchon and get a feel for the seoul of old. Slate roofed houses seemingly built on top of one another on the side of a mountain nestled with restaurants galleries street food....a must see. Through the neighborhood takes you back down towards Insagong were even more treats and sights await. Take it all in!!
Traditional,"Have you ever been to the oldest part in your hometown ? How do you like it ? In Bukchon there are several old-stle houses. And almost all refurbished and in good condition. So if you are near to Bukchon, just jump in. If not, don't worry."
Quaint,A long established neighborhood of traditional Korean architecture nestled within site of the modern high rises of Seoul. Visiting Bukchon allows one to experience and appreciated the materials and style of yesterday's Korea. Very nice and upscale shops and galleries are sprinkled throughout the area.
Go in the AM.,"Go in the morning to avoid crowds. Bukchon has beautiful little streets, interesting rooftops, and is worth an hour's visit. "
Bukchon,The Bukchon Hanook village is a site to behold because of the ancestral houses being preserved by the owners. The place will let you see how they lived before and see the type of life they have before.
Beautiful korea homes,Talk about tradition. If you want to enjoy Korean traditional homes from 500 years ago check this place out its Beautiful you can even go into some of the homes if its possible do itIt's a unique opportunity in the heart of a giant city 
bukchon,This old city is amazing nice.....many old buildings with many very nice shops and galleries everywhere
Ancient Town,"Love this town, its so ancient feel, all the house and doors are so small, short. It feels really peaceful here. "
Old Korean Charm,"We went here with friends who were living in Seoul at the time. They wanted to show us a contrasting version of downtown Seoul, which is very modern and fast paced. This street was great to see how old Seoul used to be. It was charming and a nice change of pace. I would recommend visiting if you're in the area. This wasn't close to where we were staying so getting here took some time and you only need about an hour here. This is a very popular spot for pictures amongst tourists and Korean families. Also know that this area is hilly."
Beautiful doorways and rooftops,This is residential area where most of the houses are still the traditional Hanok houses but since most doors are close you can only get a glimpse of the rooftops and doorways. There are some souvenir or artist shops that are open for tourist but it doesn't really give you the real feel- I guess for that you really need to stay on one those Hanok guest houses .
Ok,"We felt like this area's charm was exaggerated. Pretty but not much to do besides take a quick stroll and maybe grab a bite to eat. Various guidebooks had advised us to spend several hours there, but we didn't understand the appeal. "
"ok to visit, nothing special","The place is bit overrated, it's a residential area with bunch of old fashion design houses, not much to see really"
Bukchon area,"the old houses in Bukcon are lovely and unique .i love those houses, but be prepared to walk up and down hill withgood comfort shoes and umbrella during summer.sometimes, you will notice young girls wearing traditional korea costumes andreally impressive and lovely."
Live Maze in Old Street of Seoul,"place must visit when you travel to Seoul, old style houses and street and friendly local. buddy and i visit this place right after Gyeongbokgung Palace. Collect ""maze map"" in Bukchon tourist information center before start your long walk (^^,) we spend approximately 2-3hours in this huge place and visit almost all of the attraction in the map. really tiring walk after completion but worth it with the nice windy whether and interesting cultural houses. "
Beautiful architecture & history,"Located near Gyeongbokgung Palace. Wear good walking shoes! The hills can be quite steep. This is a MUST visit. The area is beautiful and the traditional hanok houses are so interesting to look at and photograph. There were also museums (closed on Mon) and quaint cafes located within the bukchon area. Go to the Bukchon Traditional Culture Center (9am to 6pm daily) located near Anguk Station Exit 3 to get a walking map 1st. Bukchon is located in Samcheong-dong which is a very nice area filled with cafes, restaurants, unique shops. You can spend hours walking around this area. One of the nicer shopping areas with cheap pricing in Seoul."
Get lost in time,My wife and I enjoyed getting lost in the small streets and pretending to be in a different time. You just have to block the hordes of tourists. Not to be missed to get a taste of traditional Korea.
steep hill,"A steep and winding road up a hill. The buildings are old, but only 100 or so years. Gives a bit of an insight about traditional homes, but crowded with tourists and a little over rated."
Hanoks,It is fun to walk around the area. Especially the little craft shops inside or the small cafe's. It is close to the palace! 
a cultural maze,"The amount of legwork required to tour this place took away the enthusiasm that I initially had. It felt like we were traversing a cultural maze that had a small intersection in every turn. It was a constant mind boggling decision as to which direction to take to fully appreciate our visit. We had no one to tell us where to go and what to do. We just made a quick stop at the tourist information office where we got a map of the village and off we went. Looking back, that was certainly not a great idea. But we were clueless as to the availability of a guide anyway, so we didn't have much of a choice. The traditional looking houses in the village appeared to have local residents living inside. So practically, this was a peek of the actual traditional Korean village. It was quite an interesting experience, but we got too exhausted to a point that regret surfaced at the end of our walking tour. If you don't mind going for an exercise while on vacation, then this should worth your consideration. "
"Quaint, interesting village","Quaint little village with small alleys and interesting architecture. If you have the time and money, visit or try out the classes and attractions offered. If not, just strolling thru them with give you a view of old Korea. Most tourist maps will provide you a detailed path/ journey in experiencing Bukchon without getting lost. Wear comfortable shoes as some areas are steep and requires some effort walking or climbing u stairs. Food establishments are located towards the south part of the attraction. "
View of the streets of old Seoul,"The area is easy to reach although it requires waling up some steep paths to view. The buildings have residents and you can only view them from the outside, most appear to have some sort of restoration, which you would expect if people are expected to inhabit them. It gives you a feel though of what the area was originally like, with tight lanes and small building with strong doors. If you climb up the hills follow the signs to the observatory where you can climb the stairs in a building to the top where you get a view looking down on the area. You are charged 3000won each and get a free tea or fruit juice for every person, well worth the price. "
Be sure to look..,"It goes by really fast and you just might miss it. It is almost like walking into a time machine, I had no idea it was one of the top-rated sites to see until I looked it up."
Definitely worth spending some time in,"We stayed in a beautiful here knock in the village, and wondered around well in the area. Really enjoyed just exploring the streets, which were surprisingly quiet for a summer day! It's pretty fascinating to see all of the little details you can find on the buildings and doors etc. Several great look out points also to see larger areas of the city or of the village. "
Interesting architecture,We went in the morning and walked around- got some great pictures of our kids in the empty streets surrounded by the cool architecture. We went in April 2014.
Go in the wee-morning time!,I can only advise something ; woke up early to take the best picture of all when practically nobody will disturb you while taking the best shot! Bukchon is one of the best hanok in Seoul and notice the arch and sculpture that each house reflect certainly is an one in a lifetime experience!
Overall a nice area but few accessible houses,"This is a nice area to walk through if you have time. Except for one house open to tourists, the rest seem to be private homes which seem to be nice but of which tourists can only have a peek through fences."
Worth the walk.,This is worth the walk to see the traditional houses and to get a view of the city through the smog. It is a bit confusing but just follow the others and head uphill.
Absolutely worth seeing,"For someone who has never been in Asia, it is impressive. It was the first thing I saw in Korea and it was really nice. Also we were very lucky cause there was a show and they were selling food and things in all the area."
Architectural highlight in Seoul to walk around,"We spent a few hours on an afternoon walking around the recommended tour from the information centre. Absolutely beautiful original style Korean architecture. History is everywhere you look here. There are also a couple of cultural centres you can visit and check out the local art and craft. The whole family enjoyed this walk. It is a little hilly in spots, but just take it easy and it is fine. I would definitely visit this place again if ever back in Seoul."
Excellent,"Walked around this whole area from the slightly more modern shopping area and streets and food stalls, to the hanok village which was very quaint and charming (though some uphill bits!) Some great street art too."
Interesting,Nice area but not a place where i would start off to get to know. Seoul. In that case i would go first to myeong dong area and surroundings
Like the Hutong in Beijing but much cleaner,"Good for an hour of walkabout as this is not exactly a designated tourism spot, and people are still actually living here although some houses already coverted into Hanoks, so be discreet when wondering around. I am not saying that people are unfriendly but you can be treated as intruders."
Great walking time,Should spend 1-2 hour(s) walking around the village (early in the morning or late in the afternoon will help you stay away from tourists group if you prefer some quiet own time). Then find your way down to Samcheongdong for a tea house experience.
Cute streets and decent views,Had a layover in Seoul and since it was already after 6pm we thought this was the best thing to do so we could get a feel of Seoul before heading back to the airport. Saw both temples from the outside and got good photos as the sun set. It was disappointing that none of the art studios were open. I would recommend if you feel like having a wonder around an artsy part of Seoul.
Great views,"We walked to Bukchon just before sunset and caught great views of Seoul- a mixture of the old traditional buildings and the new ones. Lots of lovely shops, restaurants and photo opportunities"
Bukchon Hanok Traditional Village,"We had limited time to visit a Hanok village away from Seoul and thought of settling for one just right inside Seoul. Took a train to Anguk station, visit the museum, walk pass the palace and reach there in approx 20 mins. It's away from the main street and you need to make a short climb up the steep slopes to visit various photograph spots. Best to visit before sky turns dark. It is a living community with various signs asking to keep noises down."
Cozy!,"Cozy houses show the old times of Seoul. Impressive views of the city and you can appreciate the contrast between old Seoul and Modern Seoul. Be prepared to walk, since there are many steep streets."
Fantastic place to visit,"Lots of shops, restaurants, ice cream and beautiful architecture. A must visit location in Seoul......."
Beautiful view,"There are good spots for a picture taking, they are numbered and there's a direction to go there, you just have to follow it since it is quite clear. It has a beautiful view on every spot. The traditional houses are unique and so beautiful. Don't forget to wear shoes instead of heels to get through the steep streets. Too bad I came on 7pm so I could not get a good picture, but the view was superb since you can see the Namsan tower and the city lights clearly. "
"Small area , just couple of streets",Here i had my usual problem : how can i find it ? At the end i could. As all of tourists . The most photographed street is on the top of the hill .
Fun to see,"Its fun to see the Korean traditional houses from outside. But there werent many opportunities to see them from within really. You'd either have to pay for a workshop to get in or something. It wasnt very big either, a little disappointing overall. "
Authentic old Seoul,"Authentic old Seoul, on the hills. Some hipster shops, tasty street food, but not an amusement park at all, meaning it is authentic. "
Peaceful,"I enjoyed myself a lot just strolling through this village. Its a good contrast to the urban and modern developed part of Seoul. Id recommend this for those who are interested in culture, history and tradition. "
Feel like a local,"Got a map and it shows a lot to explore the entire buchok hanok village! There are hundreds of houses with different designs of roofs, walls, doors, stairs, and if you love the mix of modern ancient architectures, you will love it. Try to enter some houses, there might have display of arts. Feel really like a local! It could take hours to explore, but you need not to visit the entire place! Some houses need a fee to enter."
Atmospheric but becoming inauthentic,"Bukchon is very atmospheric, featuring many buildings in the traditional hanoak style. But that's the problem -- they're largely just in hanoak style, not actually vintage or historic buildings. In fact, knocking down an old hanoak to replace it with a new building in hanoak style is a common practice. That said, Bukchon is one of the last places in Seoul, maybe the last place, to see a traditional roofscape uninterrupted by multistory modern buildings. Definitely worth visiting for that, as well as some for the specialty shopping, small private museums and independent cafes and restaurants."
Bukchon,Had to come here since a lot of K-dramas are filmed here. Coming from the States and getting a chance to walk where these beautiful homes are was surreal. The day we went they were doing a cosplay photoshoot very nice so we saw Hollywood types following the actress/model. 
A good introduction to the hanok architecture around in Seoul,"The Bukchon area is relatively challenging as a climb, and not the most conducive for family travel, if you have children and old folks with you who tend to be very slow or shy away from exercise. Technically, the Bukchon area is accessible from Samcheongdong right at the end of Samcheong-ro, and via a pair of long staircases, you climb up to the top of the hill where you can see these traditional hanok (Korean houses). The area is still inhabited by locals, so you are advised to keep your speaking voice relatively low and quiet when walking around the area, and especially as the day draws to a close, even if you do desire to see the sunset and distant parts of Seoul from an elevation around this Bukchon hanok area, do take care not to scream, shout or talk loudly. This area is arguably one of the few areas in Seoul which still manages to preserve the traditional Korean hanok architecture very well, despite regular tourism. "
Ginseng Chicken - expect a 45 mins wait,"Bukchon is the location where we had their famous ginseng chicken (a whole spring chicken stuffed with glutinous rice and ginseng). The shop we went to was famous - we got there at nearly 11am and had a seat immediately (after only 15mins wait) , but by the time we finished lunch about 12ish the queue outside the shop stretched more than 500km - the shopkeeper told us it would be a 45 mins wait on average. The local guide with us told us that koreans dont go to this shop - it catered to tourists and an ""authentic shop"" for koreans were situated just 3 streets away. however, to this tourist's taste, this experience was good enough. Being accustomed to the chinese style of ginseng soup which is of a stronger taste, the korean ginseng chicken experience was quite mild. they give you a small glass of ginseng wine to drink or mix into your soup, which was quite interesting. "
Untouristy neighborhood,"Great walking neighborhood with lots of traditional Hanok huts. Near Insadong shopping and dining, palaces."
Traditional Korean Village,We loved Bukchon. The whole area is just perfect for spending a day. It is a traditional Korean village. When you're there make sure to visit one of the little stores that has the traditional Korean Hanbok's of the King and Queen. Great souvenir photos. Enjoy!
Put on your walking shoes!,"It was nice to see the lovely homes. Definitely bring your walking shoes, and be prepared to be walking drenched in sweat if you are going in the summer, as we did today. Looked like there were quite a few options for food and other refreshments. While walking around, we saw a sign for the Institute of Traditional Korean Cuisine, however we were sad to find it was closed. In fact, many little shops and galleries looked closed due to it being Sunday. We did go into the home of Go Hui-dong who was Korea's first artist who painted in the Western style. A staff member gave us a little tour of his home which also featured his artwork."
Cute little Village,"We did a walking tour of this village. Sort of reminds me of parts of San Francisco, USA. Quaint little streets and shops nestled on the hillsides. A ton of walking so have you most comfortable shoes."
Nice place to wander...,"The beautiful houses... the neighbourhood filled with shops... we saw many fruit vendors cruising the street selling things off the back of their trucks... nice first day for us.The streets are narrow, so be mindful... we also found the Korean drivers to be a little... hmm... aggressive? Stay on your toes as a pedestrian (and buckle up if you're a passenger).Definitely take a walk through here... and bring your camera."
I got lost,"I got lost moving around this hanok village but it was worth the time. Lovely lines of Korean traditional houses. Next time I come to Korea, I'll definitely stay in a hanok."
One of Seoul's most interesting & charming neighborhoods,"Bukchon is one of Seoul's most interesting and charming neighborhoods; it's full of 'hanok' -- traditional tile roofed houses -- as well as museums and galleries. In fact, Bukchon has become somewhat gentrified and prettified, so it's the opposite of gritty old working class neighborhoods like Mapo-gu; but Bukchon didn't have a Disneyland feel, either. You can get a very helpful map of the neighborhood ('Bukchon Wanderings') from the Bukchon Jaedong Tourist Information Center, which is just a few blocks north of the Anguk subway station; take exit 2 and walk north on Gahoe-ro (street). Since Bukchon is right next to Changdeokgung, I'd suggest taking the tour of the Secret Garden (unlike the rest of the palace, the Piwon is only open to those on a guided tour) and then exploring Bukchon, which also has a host of good and generally very affordable restaurants; after doing the tour of the Biwon, which is enormous, you may want to eat and rest your feet for a bit~!"
lovely alley,"to much alley at Bukchon and really confused to found the best alley. so, we try to ask and found the maps to seen the Bukchon alley. there's a couple houses with traditional Korean things, not to much. but I loves it.enjoy the alley with little rainy, so romantic :D"
overrated,"we wanted to go to bukchon because the pictures looked great. however, we should have stuck with the pictures. the real thing is so-so. not sure if we went to the wrong side of the bukchon village but there were also other tourists with us and so we were confident that it was the correct place."
Real peek into Seoul,"It was a peek into the real Seoul, we were quiet and the neighborhood was most enjoyable. Lovely houses and a nice view from the top of the village. "
Great neighborhood to walk through!,"This is a neighborhood in Seoul that includes numerous houses that are hundreds of years old and are beautiful to visit. Keep in mind that this is a neighborhood where people live, so as the signs advise, keep the noise to a minimum."
Nice place to strong,"This was a really nice place to stroll. There is a tourism office that provides maps and the buildings are lovely to take it. There are shops, boutiques and cafes all along the way to make the walk more interesting.Be sure to stop at the craft center - it is a fun diversion!"
Traditional Village,Get a feel for a traditional Korean village and home. Narrow streets and alleys so it's easier to walk than drive. Stay in a hanok to get a real flavor of Korean tradition. Great breakfasts!
Blast from the past...,A village full of 600 year old houses (hanok) within walking distance of Changdeokgung Palace in the midst of urban development is simply amazing.The house owners are nice to accommodate having thousands of people plying their streets taking gazillions of photos. Especially considering as most of them are quite wealthy being able to afford these prime real estate & heritage houses. It was nice to walk the various alleyways & just see where the sageuks are filmed. We took a photo in one of the alleyways overlooking the city & one wearing korean traditional costume & have that as background. It's actually cool. 
Beautiful Bukchon,Such an amazing place with great history. We see Bukchon in Korean dramas and we thought of it as so beautiful. Seeing it in person made our trip worthwhile.
The perfect taste of traditional Seoul,It's obviously not the most authentic traditional village but what do you expect when it's so conveniently located between two of Seoul's most popular palaces? There maybe a few tourists milling about but the streets are still very beautiful and there are numerous cute cafes well worth a stop at. I'd definitely recommend taking the time to explore these tiny side streets to break up your palace sightseeing in Seoul
Too touristy,"The streets are of the ancient past, however, very much renovated to add the modern feel. Hence to me, it has lost its ancient feel a lot. I walked for 15 minutes and was done. The rest of shops along the surrounding streets are almost 100% western and modern shops like café, coffee, souvenirs."
Good starting point for your Bugaksan day trip,"The Bukchon Hanok Village was a nice place to stroll through. I enjoyed looking at the architecture, but it just seemed like a residential area, so it was a little weird just looking at people's homes. There were a few open doors for museums, craft shops, and restaurant, but not too many. I didn't really know where to go, so we just wandered around, and it was interesting. This by itself is not enough of a draw, but it is at the base of the Bugaksan Mountain, which is definitely worth visiting. So you can go here for an hour in the morning, then take the bus up the mountain, and spend the rest of the day hiking."
Traditional village walk in Seoul,"Quite and traditional walk in South Korea, we can have a nice half day walk. Don't miss the cafe with waffle and icecream or coffee in afternoon"
Not worth visiting,Did not really find anything very interesting on my trip to Bukchon. Therefore would not be revisiting when i am in Seoul.
Wonderful location,I highly recommend this Hanuk village. The architecture is tremendous and at residence tells a story of a bygone era. We actually stayed 3 nights in Hanuk accommodation and would visit there in a heartbeat.
Visit korea,"Great architecture, beautiful view of Seuol, has some boutique shops that makes it more interesting to rest and catch your breath. Steep climb at times."
Rich in heritage and culture,"However there were a lot of tourists, so you might not be able to take good photos. But anyway, the traditional homes that were there are vibrant and peaceful. "
Fantastic Walk Through Traditional Houses,"The Bukchon Hanok village was an interesting journey through a collection of traditional wooden houses. The hills make the view of the centre of Seoul. This is a ""must do"" walk for visitors. "
"Historic, Great photos","Nice to see a slice of historic Seoul. Go to the Bukchon Traditional Culture Center and pick up the English brochure Bukchon Wanderings. It gives a map of all the must see views (great photos) and you can shop around along the way.A note about transportation. Rather than using the metro and wandering around to find something we took cabs. Orange cabs are very cheap, we never spent more than six dollars and that is on the high end. Cab drivers don't expect tips but if it was a small amount we did."
Nice area with traditional Hanok houses,"Nice area to just stroll around. The Bukchon hanok village has a lot of narrow cosy streets with traditional ""hanok"" wooden houses. Recommend to go up in Bukchon observatory (3000 KRW pr person). From there you get a good view over the hanok village roofs and across to N Seoul tower in Namsan."
Like going back in time,"Beautiful village with amazing old houses. Have a tranquil walk around, and take in the age-old scenery."
Ok. Not to die for.,"This wasn't my favorite place in Korea. If you're in the area, it's worth the stop to walk through, but don't spend more than 30 minutes here. Most of what there is to see costs (like small art museums only one room big) and isn't worth it (in this artist's opinion). If you're in seoul for a short time, go do something bigger like Myeongdong or Bukhansan instead."
A must see during your visit to Seoul,Bukchon is a small traditional area located an easy subway trip from central Seoul. It is famous for the traditional wooden houses that are dotted around the area. It is also the home to the Prime Minister of Korea - although his house is rather more grand. The area is great for a pleasant stroll so that you can take in the sights and also create some great photos of the old houses with Seoul's rising skyline in the background. There is a small tourist office which provides a free walking map - not the best map in the world admittedly - however it's enough to show you where the main photo opportunities are and enough to get you back on track when you inevitably get lost around the myriad tiny alleyways.The area is however quite hilly in parts so perhaps not suitable for all travellers. There are also a couple of palaces nearby although I didn't get the chance to visit - from a distance however they looked impressive.
Nice walk in old part,This is a nice place to take pictures of the old buildings. Go all the way up for the best photo spots! Nice cafes around.
Beautiful old streets,I was taken here by a local work colleague so that I could see the traditional old Korean buildings..I thought they were beautiful and a lovely walk up and down hilly streets. We found some respite from the heat in a tea house which was cool and served the most amazing fruit teas. I could have spent alot more time here..!
Good place to visit for a morning walk,"Most of the old homes (hanoks) have been restored, and it's fun to walk up and down the neighborhood streets in among the old houses. As you go higher you can sometimes get a peek into the interior courtyards of the buildings. As the day goes by, more and more tourists arrive. This can make for some fun people watching as the tourists pose for pictures among the old buildings. When you reach the top and are done exploring the hanoks, head up the road near the top that borders the neighborhood to the left. Eventually you will come to a staircase on the left that will take you down a winding path to the main street far below. Along the way keep an eye out for the bar/cafe on the left side of the path called ""Ontheground"". This is a fun place to stop for refreshment and a chat with the friendly owners. "
Hanoks after hanoks,"This large area is suitable for slow strolls and lots of picture taking. Make sure to get a pamphlet with the 10? views of Bukchon and get the cameras ready. You can see many traditional styled buildings and alleys. Many of the hanoks can be rented as a house stay for a reasonable price. There are many hanoks converted to restaurants, tea houses, museums, etc... The wall through the views are very hilly. Don't do it in a hot day. At places up high, you can see good views of the surrounding areas and mountains."
A walk in royal history of Seoul,"This neighborhood is best to visit early in am or late at night, when it is not overrun with tourists and ""selfies"" . There a few streets, which are highly picturesque with older homes, located between the two palaces. We stayed in a real, legitimate :Hanok here (a Korean style high end B&B)"
Nice walk in the morning,It is located in a hilly area. Wear a pair of comfortable shoes to walk around. It is like a time travel to see traditional houses first thing in the morning to beat the crowd. Peaceful and beautiful. Worth to visit while in Seoul.
Traditional Korean architecture,"Must visit if interested in traditional Korean architecture. Many excellent, well-preserved private houses (and some B&Bs) in a quiet district for the well-heeled. Nice area to walk around (only marred by noisy tour groups from China sad to say, despite signs saying to please keep noise level down). Stop at Books Cooks for tea (see my review for this cosy joint)."
A fun day to wander through.,Definitely go see. It's even better during the lotus lantern festival time. The streets and shops are decorated with brightly colored lanterns and there's a celebratory air about the city.
Beautiful,This was one of my favourite places to visit in Seoul. It's very beautiful and special. Gives that older day feel. Definitely a place to see while you are visiting Seoul.
Beautiful village,it is a quiet and beautiful street during Winter. There are shops and restaurant in this place. One of the best place during our trip here.
A great traditional experience without leaving the capital,This is a fantastic place for people to visit who want to see a traditional Korean environment without travelling outside of Seoul. Also good for K-Pop fans
Good to see,It is a street with soul you have to feel it. There is a lot of small restaurants with virtually everything. Nice view from the top of the district.
For traditional walk through the villages,We went here on our last day and so glad we did. We spent approximately 4 hour strolling through the lane ways and walking into the traditional shops. We found lovely secluded coffee shops along the way which we had some wonderful iced coffee to cool ourselves down. Take some good walking shoes as climbing the hills is a must. You get to look down on the traditional roofs. If you follow the signs they will lead you to where you can obtain a map which marks out the walking routes to follow. Of course we got totally lost and went our own way but that is half the fun! Again there are more shops and some that specialised in arts and crafts. One of the highlights of our trip. 
korean culture,"different style of the traditional korean house are right here. but you have to walk up and down to see all different house, sport shoes is better"
Traditional neighborhood,"Bukchon is a traditional Korean village, composed of several neighborhoods. It is composed of several narrow alleys.It has more than 600 years of history, allowing the visitors to experience the atmosphere of the Joseon dinasty.Some of the recently renewed houses can be visited for a cost."
Nice area to walk around,"Bukchon Village with winding streets, traditional building, shops and restaurants is a nice place to spend couple of hours wondering around. If you have an extra time it is worth seeing."
This is a very interesting part of the city,It is like a city within a city and most of the homes are preserved with the old ways of building. Lots of shopping too! Make sure you have comfy shoes on for this tour.
Nice stroll,Nice stroll around old houses although some of them seemed very modern! There are many nice shops from local designers and a few nice cafes albeit very expensive!
Lovely area to walk and shop!,"This was a perfect area to walk around, shop and eat for the day. Very close to Insadong and I actually like the shops a little better. While they were a little pricey and less like a market, it was quieter, quaint boutique shopping. This was probably my favorite area in Seoul!"
Good place for taking leisure,Its Nice if you were to visit early mornings otherwise this place swell by noon time with large crowd of Camera touting tourist from all over the world !! Wonderful Traditional Houses You must look out for the Old Quiant corner where you find traditional simple food is being served !! Delicious
Quaint neighborhood,"If you want to see a residential area in Seoul without all of the hustle and bustle of tourists, Bukchon is the place for you.Located north of the more busy Insadong area, it provides a contrast to the rest of Seoul. A lot of signs around the neighborhood telling you to keep quiet because its a residential area.Here you can see the Bukchon Hanok Village, which is an area with the traditional houses and little shops and cafes for the tourists that do make it out here.For an experience of the real Seoul, we recommend visiting this place."
Lovely quaint neighbourhood,"Such a quaint place.. love everything about it, even the long hike up the hills. It was like a gem in the city.. there is one spot where you get to the highest point you can see the modern seoul at the back, simply breathtaking. I love the shops and cafes, they were all attractive looking. Loved this one fragrance shop called ""Granhand"". I hope I can go again to Bukchon taking my time and just wandering around there."
Beautiful past,"This beautiful part of Seoul is best seen on a nice cool sunny day. Lots of uphill walking, so wear your most comfortable sneakers. I walked all the way up til I can get a good view of namsan. The houses were beautiful and the shops around were awesome. Bukchon, together with samcheong ro can occupy your whole day. So many things to see and do."
"Experience Korean traditional village, smacked in Seoul metropolitan","This place of interest has many narrow walkway uphill and downhill where you can see the house from previous Seoul era. Many of them has classical outlook, bamboo, wood, traditional roof tiles. They are not just for viewing, these are actual houses where local are still living in it. At here, time has rewind, back to the olden days. You will forget that you are in a busy metropolitan, as if you are still in the classical era.https://vinshengloh.exposure.co/butcheon-traditional-village"
a walk back in time,"the place shows how life in korea was before all the modernization came about,beautiful houses some converted to become inns and restaurants/cafes. a definite must go to place for the arts and culture buff"
Not so impressed,"It is, really, a piece of history lost in time. But ancient houses are scarse, not so well maintained. Other regions, around the palaces, exhibit same architecture."
Old meets new,Very scenic area with the traditional hanoks and great photography time. Nice strolls up and down the allies finding little hidden surprises.
Nice quiet place,Bukchon is a nice cultural place. Beautiful and quiet place for a stroll. The scenery there are priceless and to understand more of their traditional cultures there too.
A cultural tradition point.,It’s nice if you visit early mornings otherwise this place swell by noon time with large crowd of Camera touting tourist from all over the world !! Wonderful Traditional Houses You must look out for the Old Quiant corner where you find traditional simple food is being served !! Delicious
Relaxing and enjoyable,Good eats...if you sneak up into small alleys...sweet people...cool stuff to see. Shop for jewelry or clothes...or enjoy a romantic cup of coffee
Interesting hanoks and peeking into the lives of the locals,"If you happen to be in the area, especially the Gyeongbokgung Palace and/or Changdeokgung Palace, this place should be on your to visit list. This would be my second visit, the first time was during the day and the second time was at night.Samcheong-dong is near to Gyeongbokgung Palace and is relatively near to Cheong Wa Dae (the Blue House a.k.a the President’s Office) and Insadong; both of which are tourist spots worth to visit. To get there just alight at the some subway station stop (Anguk Station, Subway Line No. 3) for Gyeongbokgung Palace.Just follow the signs and you will find yourself at Samcheong-dong, one of the most unique places in Seoul where there is the hanok (traditional house made out of wood and put together without any nails) Bukchon Village. Samcheong-dong is a beautiful neighborhood and will definitely take more than half a day to take in the sights.As it was evening time, there were many students on their way home after school and the crowd was lessened as compared to the last time I was there. It was literally an uphill task… it’s a hilly area with pretty steep slopes. We passed by a couple of familiar shops, but the night setting gave the area a slightly different feel and made it even more of an adventure.Walking through the neighborhood peppered with both the traditional and modern is an enjoyable activity: some hanoks are occupied by residents while some are into chic galleries, restaurants, cafés and accessory shops. And while you are here, don't forget to eat the yummy street food!For more on my experience and photos, please check out my blog: http://www.travelbytez.com/2013/09/samcheong-dong-bukchon-village-food.htmland http://www.travelbytez.com/2015/05/bukchon-village-at-night.html"
"Sightseeing, nothing much",This place is good for sightseeing and cafe hopping. It's quiet along the routes within the residential areas but nothing spectacular. Nice to have a walk around but not a must to go.
"Gem of Seoul, not often known","We only explore this old part of the city in our recent trip. Close to the palaces, museums, presidential house, and, importantly, gorgeous mountains, small shops and eateries are fun and enjoyable."
A journey back in time,"Explored around the traditional Bukchon Hanok homes area today. The area is surrounded by Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace and Jongmyo Shrine,and is home to hundreds of traditional houses that date back to the Joseon Dynasty. Very colorful neighborhoods and many of these hanoks operate as coffee shops, cultural centers, guesthouses, restaurants and tea houses. After exiting the subway at anjuk, just look for the Hyundai HQ and head up the hill. So much to see."
Beautiful Traditional Houses,"It was a very nice tour to experience the old style Korean houses. They have it's own style and are beautiful. The place is unique, quiet & clean. Please be considered to keep quiet when we visit there as there are people living in the houses."
"Okay for sightseeing, but wouldn't waste too much time.","It's pretty nice to see the traditional Korean homes, but asides from that this place was kind of boring. A lot of the houses are occupied with real tenants so you can't really explore any of them unless you book a room at one through airbnb."
Worth visiting,"This village is close to the two biggest palaces, so it's convinient to combine visits together. As many other areas in Seoul, this one is hilly, so prepare for climbing. Not many activities except looking at the traditional houses. Anyway, worth checking it out to grasp the atmosphere of many-faced Seoul."
classic traditional houses around,Its a place where you can see a korean traditional village. Check out the local house. Dont forget to visit the gift store where you can get the kpop merchandise.
god cultural place,this village is located in the city and can see lots of students do their activities here ..nice view ...
Take a free tour with Visit Seoul,"""Seoul City Walking Tours"" is a free program offered by the city of Seoul designed for tourists who want to see Seoul’s top tourist attractions on foot under the expert guidance of multilingual tour guides. Reservations for this program can be made via the internet and mobile web at www.visitseoul.net.No tipping is necessary. We took a free City tour of these villages and it was great!! Our guide new all the alleyways and which paths to take to see the best sights and views. She also gave us much more info on the area and history that we would not have gotten if we had walked this area on our own. I highly recommend booking a guide with visit Seoul! The Bukchon village is not to be missed!! It gives you a glimpse into traditional Korean living."
Pleasant surprise!,"Taking a walk through the traditional village of Bukchon was a great experience. This isolated area of Seoul was a pleasant surprise in contrast to the rest of of the city that is fast-paced and busy. It was good to see that some of the tradition of Korea had been preserved, although it is just a small area. I would recommend a visit to this area."
Traditional Houses,Tourists can go to this place before going to palaces. This is near to Changdeokgung Palace. There's a simple reminder for tourists to keep silence as a respect for the residents.Very nice place to take pictures.!
Traditional village,"Going here, Chungmuro station then exit 3. It's the 2nd block from the exit, after Korea House.There's no admission ticket. I guess its because of the cultural week. The traditional houses/rooms and cook ware was well maintained. Upon the entrance, there were men who's on cultural outfit, who were weaving traditional baskets, shoes and etc.There was even a traditional wedding held yesterday. The bride and groom's attire was really beautiful.Even the traditional bed and pillows were well maintained.It was a very good experience of traditional korean life. N Seoul Tower is near the area through NAMSAN TOUR bus."
Very Quaint,"Visited Bukchon on an unusually warm day during early Spring. Other than the warm weather, the walk around Bukchon was interesting. The traditional houses are built closely-knitted and you wonder how it feels to live so close to your neighbours but I got a chance to step into a open house and surprisingly the internal compound was very surreal, cooling, private and cosy. On top of the traditional houses, there are plenty of quaint shops to keep your eyes and wallets busy. My girlfriend and I enjoyed our first trip there so much that we visited again during our 8-day stay in Seoul. On a good cool day, you can leisurely walk from Gyeongbukgong Palace to Bukchon. A must visit place."
"A dressed-up view of ""the way things were""","Bukchon Hanok Village has old traditional houses that people actually live in. It is a good daytime walk; actually can be a little crowded with Korean couples on a nice weekend afternoon. Hilly and some decent views of the downtown. You can also arrange an overnight stay there, and Bukchon becomes considerably quieter and more peaceful once the couples depart during the evening hours.The houses here are unique and definitely Korean. Most of them are remodels and a bit dressed up, but as a tourist you probably wouldn't realize that. Try to find a map which shows the recommended walking path to ensure that you don't miss anything worth seeing."
Tiring on the way up but the view was worth it,Had to walk a while to get to the top/ But the view was well worth it. Had a few cafes at the top which was nice. Nice to see the culture and old style buildings
Beautiful Area,"We visited the Hanok Village, a collection of private, walled garden homes built up and down narrow streets. Beautiful architecture and lovely to see, first-hand."
"Real korea, must visit","Good place for walking, sightseeing and shooting photo. Near anguk station, can spend a lot of time there then visit the Gyeongbokgung palace."
Like a historical housing,"This place is amazing, its located on a small hill. All the houses have big and cool doors. The funny thing is that this area looks like its been more than 100 years old, but some doors have very modern high tech locks. Most house are locked and these people dont want any disturbance. Only one house was open for public to enter and take a look. Very nice view when you walk to the top.Youtube - lolsia2000"
A world of its own,Take a stroll down the lane to see the traditional houses. Many with home grown flowers/ plants and the great exterior. You will see many people walking the same path. It's linked to Samcheong area so enjoy a good cuppa after that.
Stunning,It is a living history in the middle f a modern city. The architecture is pretty different than the ones can be seen in Europe or North America. Small houses attached to each other creates a cozy feeling. Such a peaceful area. There are also small guesthouses in this area where you can stay and enjoy the traditional Korean hospitality but you must book well in advance.
Average,"Bukchon is much like the palaces, not really old just remodeled. There are actually fine examples of old homes located in the neighborhood surrounding Bukchon."
take time to make art objects,great little artisan shops and cultural treasure activities where you can pay a small fee to make a mirror or paper mache box
It's all you expect it to be- great place for a walk round,"On arrival at Anguk subway station we were met by an old man with a walking stick who insisted in showing us correct exit to see the village (exit 3) - such an act of kindness. Bukchon is beautiful, the streets quaint and is really is all you expect it to be. It's busy, it's beautiful - it's great and can't imagine a trip to Seoul without visiting here. This is not a stop on the hop on hop off, so you will have to make your own way here, but it's easy to find."
Very interesting,Exploring quaint streets full of traditional housing and monuments and just so tranquil. Easy walking for the most part with some small sections that are up hill but the views are worth it. It is a 10 min walk from Insadong shopping street.
"Traditional Hanoks, Modern Families","It's really a beautiful place, it would've been better if the tourists could keep their volumes down. "
daebakkk,"This is traditional village in seoul.Not to far form Gyeongbokgung Palace. Its easy to get there ( Anguk Station (Seoul Subway Line 3), Exit 2) and u have no need to pay any fee. U can get a good view to see Seoul city from the highest place in Village.Before u go, remember to pick up Bukchon map at the Information booth ."
"traditional Korean House, Amazing Place",Bukchon Hanok Village is home to hundreds of traditional houses called 'hanok' that date back to the Joseon Dynasty.
Busy but worthwhile to see ,While very crowded with tourists the village is worthwhile visiting. Friendly city guides give you information about how to walk and give you directions. It's a walk mostly uphill and then you can get a nice view over the lovely old rooftops! On our way back between Insadong and the Lotte department store area we visited the beautiful Buddhist Jogyesa temple!
Traditional korean houses in the middle of new buildings ,I liked the small area..you can see the old korean houses..old doors but it's a small area you can finish it in 30 min max but it worths visiting
Traditional houses,It's a hideout in within the busy city. Traditional Korean houses can be seen in the area. Be prepared to go up slopes n also walk in a huge area. Wear comfortable shoes!
My little hide out,"I enjoy getting lost in Bukchon area. I enjoy the tranquility, the culture, the history of what Seoul once was. If you are lucky and get to experience a little Bukchon home stay, that probably is the best decision you would possibly make during your visit in the wonderful city. "
It was nice,"A quiet place to get away from Gangnam and Myeongdong. Nice, older style houses and some good cafes to relax.There isn't much there, but if you just need an hour or 2 of walking and enjoying architecture, it's a good place. It would be nice if they had some more information about the history of the area interspersed among the walking paths, but I guess that's why they have Google."
Traditional House Overnight,"We stayed 3 nights in the Bukchon area and enjoyed the experience except for the uncomfortable sleeping arrangements in our traditional guesthouse. Young people would be fine, but as an older adult, the thin mats on a hard floor made for very long nights. We joked that the Koreans work such long hours ever day, because lazing around in bed would be too miserable. However, we ate at many delicious small restaurants, trying different kinds of food at each meal, toured palaces and wandered the streets just looking at houses and in shops."
One of my favorite parts of Seoul,I love wandering through this historic area of Seoul. The houses are beautifully restored. It should be on everyone's list to see how people used to live.
hidden gem in the city!!!,"such a fantastic cute little traditional village in the city. the traditional houses, streets and culture is well preserved. There are nice museums and workshops that you can attend in the village. I would suggest that you go to the visitor centre at the bottom of the village and get a map so you know where to go. surely not to be missed when in seoul."
Loved it!,"Lively, but not overcrowded. Lots of little shops and restaurants, good atmosphere. Try to sneak in some little back alleys and enjoy the non commercial side of the village."
One of the few traditional neighbourhoods left untouched,"Thoroughly enjoyed wandering around the neighbourhood, with its traditional korean wooden houses, some original, others restored. Most of old seoul was destroyed either by the japanese or by the civil war somthis gives youna glimpse what seoul must have looked like. Take a map from the tourist office or the information guides posted around the area to help you navigate your way around."
"Great, fit to your schedule even if you are in Seoul for one day","Village gives you a sense of traditional living in Korea. Beautiful views, picturesque houses, try to see a small museum-house. Many thanks to Michael Kim (ultimatekoreatour@gmail.com) from UltimateKoreaTour for bringing us to the Village."
Such a cute place!,This place is so picturesque! I highly recommend going to the visitor center first to pick up a map so that u would know where to go!
A wonderfully nostalgic stroll,"Strolling through the streets of this historic and well-preserved village will simply pull at your nostalgic heartstrings. I mostly followed the recommended walking course, since it is a residential area, but took a few little twists and turns along the way to get out of the crowded zones. It was really crowded when I went, but that may have been due to it being a national holiday. It was fun to see all of the intricate details that go into each of the hanoks, right down to the locks on the window covers. If you go early enough, you'll be able to participate in some of the craft-making options available. There's a whole area dedicated to traditional crafts up at the top of the hill. Check the map you can get at the information center near the start of the journey for details!"
Amazing preserved old quarter in the centre of one of the largest cities in the world,"Bukchon is amazing, because it isn't an artificial, touristy fake historical village - it is a real, vibrant neighborhood with homes, cool shops, coffee houses, craftsmen, and B&B's all using the traditional 'hanok' houses. It can get pretty busy with visitors on a nice day (which makes it hard to get good photos), but it is definitely worth a visit. To put it in perspective, Seoul is a city of 23 million, and packed into one of the highest densities on the planet. And yet they have managed to preserve this neighborhood right in the center of the city - imagine a 18th century neighborhood preserved in the center of Manhattan!"
Love this place,I have been here for 3 times.. but i never been bored.. this place is so cozy and feels like home.. you stop at anguk station and exit 6 after you exit you strait ahead and turn right at bukchon ilga 12 enjoy your trip..
Quite and clean,unique and feel like back to the old day. Nice view from nice houses. Tourist map is help to find what to see and where to start. Must come early (start 10 am) so will have more time to walk up and down. Nice decoration in some house and nice wall painting in some area. 
Restored 'Traditional houses',"It was very accessible, though you need to walk for a few minutes. As of the houses we had seen, mostly were already restored, but still impressive. Or maybe we were just not able to see the much older ones. But we happen to stumbled upon some shooting near the Winter Sonata drama location. I just cant tell if it was for a commercial or drama or movie, and I didnt knew the actors. But goodlooking, though. :)"
Good place for picture taking,I was quite impress with the design. took tons of photos there. U can try on Korean traditional clothes here and snap a shoot. or maybe more than one ;)
OK but not spectacular,"As a huge Korean drama fan I expected more from this, but it was just ok. Very crowded on a Saturday , lots of coffee shops, and fancy souvenirs. "
Quaint village,Rooftops upon rooftops. Lovely place to spend a couple of hours. Need good walking shoes as a few hills but otherwise worthwhile. 
Fusion of old and new,"This place is a short walk from Anguk subway station. A stroll past quaint little stores and restaurants. Upon reaching Bukchon Hanok Village, it wasn't what I was expecting. It was mostly modernized. CCTV cameras everywhere, electric garages. I guess I was expecting more. Should've researched more."
A Picturesque and Lovely Walk,"We took the subway to the Anguk stop and managed to find the Jaedong Tourist Information Center for the super helpful Tourist Map of Bukchon. That included a walking tour through the Bukchon Traditional Craft Experience Center (different craft houses along a picturesque and slightly hilly street) and the famous Bukchon-ro 11-gil area of old traditional houses. My favorite shopping section was along the Gyedong-gil section of the tour. I liked it more than the Samcheong Dong Road area (though I didn't have much time to go into many shops in either area). I would allow time to explore the shops and the craft houses. People still live in the protected historical houses, but to get an idea of the traditional Korean home, you can go into the craft houses. I would highly recommend this area. "
Lovely place!,"I love this place! Very traditional neighbourhood. Nice local artist, restaurants, houses... This is the place i like most in Seoul area."
A Walk Back in Time,"The traditional homes here are still lived in and this is an active neighborhood. The narrow serpentine streets are very fun to wander. with many great views, the most famous is the view of the far off Namsan Tower. I really loved walking to th e top of the village and walking along Bokchon-ro-15 gil This is a road that is perched atop a high cliff/wall with great views toward Samcheong-dong and Palpan-dong, you can also get a glimpse of Gwangbokgung Palace. A great day on foot, wear comfortable shoes as some of the hills are steep."
A must see for all,"Before this traditional housing village is banned from public access, you must go to see and walk through one of the last well preserved traditional housing areas in S Korea. There are traditional items being made with lots of cool shops and boutiques. "
Experience old Korea in a touristy way.,"Quite impressed with the old Korean village, arts and crafts places in the village. Great place to stroll around and experience old Korea. However, this place is becoming a bit touristy and in spite of the signs to keep quiet it is rather difficult to control an excited crowd."
Nice scenery.,Good place to walk around.More easier if you use Seoul Walking Guide service (It's great and it's free!) so you don't have to wonder around the big area.
Delightful historic district to wander through,Stop at the tourist info center to get a detailed map of Bukchon district. Nicely restored homes and some very nice shops. 
Bukchon Hanok Village - a great place to wander round!,This is an area of traditional Korean house in a very hilly area between the Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces. It is quite a fashionable (and probably expensive) area and there are a number of interesting small museums and shops in the area. There is obviously a tension between the people who live there and the hordes of rather noisy young tourists who climb up and down the steep streets - signs urging quietness are everywhere!But it is well worth a visit - if you don't mind dodging the young girls with their 'Selfie Sticks!
Nothing like Staying in a Hanok to appreciate the Buckchon village,"By walking through the alleyways of the Buckchon, one can only see, to appreciate it.It is best experienced and appreciated by staying in one of the hanoks in the Bukchon village. There is limited accomodation though. Then, one can experience the interior feel of residing in one of them, even if it is for a night. However, please don't bring your whole suitcase because there wont be enough space for that & dragging the suitcase will be tough in the confusing alleyways. An over-nighter bag will do. Then, one can experience the quiet & peacefulness of the village as the sun sets and enjoy meals sitting cross legged on the heated floor. It is an experience.Walking through the alley gives you photos to take-away but staying there is an experience no one can take from you."
Explore beyond the norm,"Most associtate Bukchon with traditional houses amidst modernity. A bit more exploration and we went into Samcheong Park which extended upwards to the fortress wall over the city. I heard a lady's voice, singing operatic style from an unknown spot. Excellent place to exercise one's lungs & skills. On a good day, one could see over the city and beyond. Apparently we could join into Waryong Park but it was past closing time. Another time perhaps."
Lovely houses,there were many many hanok houses here. And they said the government preserved it so that no one would be allowed to destroy any of their old houses or commercial companies buy the lands and destroy the houses. lovely neighborhood.
Corner of traditional houses in modern Seoul,"There are many boutique shops,and small restaurants, narrow side streets,there is one of places to see old traditional Korean buildings,in spite that there are many people strolling there amazing cleanness everywhere."
Nostalgic ambience,It's a quiet place with loads of old Korean houses and winding lanes weaving around. You may find couple volunteers in those lanes for directions and information. They also keep remind visitors to be quiet since it's a residential area. Please respect the locals. Don't speak too loud while visiting. 
Great place to visit,"Bukchon was the first place I went to visit in Seoul, great place to walk around and see the traditional housing. Nice window shopping and cute cafes. At the tourist info you can pick up a great map which plans out a 1-2hour walking tour covering the highlights."
cultural walk,beautiful road and houses lining the street. leads to samcheongdong .. where you can visit the nice cozy cafes!
Nostalgic & beautiful..,"Rows & rows of traditional Hanok houses weaving through many lanes.Very peaceful & beautiful.It brings one back to nostalgia, that in a modern city like Seoul; one can still see the tradition being preserved by these Hanoks.A must see when in Seoul."
Bukchon Hanok Village,"This is my 1st visit to Seoul and over the 2 days visit I've gone back twice to this place. It is a place for people who appreciate old traditional buildings. I love wondering on every paths as many of them are unique and different in their own ways.One of the Hanok has crafted creatures on their balcony, another have plants in traditional pots outside their house, very Zen & peaceful.There is a shop called Granhand, love his creations of different scents. It's of natural scents made from plant extracts of quality ingredient, very different feel from the branded eau de toilette over the counter.Amongst the Hanok one of them are opened to public for a minimal price of KRW15000 entrance fee comes with a nice herbal tea at the end of the tour of. This house belongs to an owner who reside in Latin America and this is their summer house. I was told this house worth USD$4M.If i ever come back again I will live in the Hanok guest house instead of hotels."
Take an Historic Walk,"We walked this historic district with a native Korean who regaled us with stories of her childhood in Seoul. This is now over touristy, but still worth the visit to see beautiful homes and some great views from the heights over Seoul. We really enjoyed it and will likely do again."
Join free walking tours,Enter this village via free tour guides from Seoul tourism website. Brings you to nice points you will not visit or think of in the village.
Traditional and pleasant part of Seoul,"How nice to wander in the narrow streets of Bukchon, with their numerous little craft shops. Rather touristic of course, but some views on the old hanoks with their tiled roofs are simply fabulous, "
A nice walk!,There are some small shops and cafes along the walk. A good and pleasant experience.
"Great view, small boutiques, old buildings",Nice walk up the hill to see the old style Korean housing and view over the city. on the way - tiny little shops and boutiques and coffee shops. Definitely worth of visiting and strolling through the narrow streets.
Take pity on the natives,"They seem to be bugged enormously by the deluge of tourists visiting, and I can well believe it. We more there on a rainy day in early April and it was maybe not stampeded, but crowded enough -so imagine what it must be like on a fine day in the season. Please keep quiet!That said, it's nice. Not the kitschy fake you might expect, really authentic. Nice and well worth an extended walking tour."
Picturesque!,"Don't be afraid to just wander about; go into alleys and such. The place is bustling with tourists so I doubt you can get lost. Climb uphill, like all the way up. The view looking down to Insadong is really scenic. Take a selfie in between quieter alleys with lesser tourists, try to capture the details of the hanoks. I bet you, the pictures will turn out unique and picturesque."
Ancient Korean Architecture,"Narrow streets, peaceful neighborhood would be the one to welcome you. Love the intricate details of each houses. I will definitely go back and immerse myself with this locals."
Meander,"Bukchon is a great place to meander. As the other reviewers have noted, while it has become a tourist location (with plaques on the ground indicating where you could take scenic pictures of yourself), it remains a residential area. In this way, it does give you a sense of what Seoul might have been like in a bygone age. Having said that, the city has invested in developing this area for tourists, and so there are activity centers, picture spots, and consequently, lots of tourists. If you go early in the morning or in the evening, it might make for a more peaceful walk -- there are cute boutiques, tea shops, cafes, and galleries in the area which also add to the overall feel. If you like to walk and wander, this is a great stop. If you're looking for one big thing to take a picture with, you might want to skip this area and head up to Namsan Tower via cable car for the bird's eye view of the city and cultural performances instead."
Lovely,"Beautiful, quiet with many lovely stores and cafes. Great for a stroll, a bite, people and building watching. Worth the visit!!"
Can't miss. Can't go wrong. Must do,When in Korea. When in Seoul. Bukchon is a must. Traditional homes mixed with modern restaurants and shops. Take a half day and stroll the lanes and roads. Enjoy a coffee or meal at one of the many local places. Friendly locals and tourists 
Nice walk,Gives you the chance to see how the houses in Korea used to look like.It's really close to the Gyengbokgung Palace and to the Secret Garden. 
Awesome!,"It's an utterly picturesque neighborhood & you will really feel the place, it is very well preserved & will give tourist a very good snapshot of what authentic Korean living is."
Lovely Place to Explore,"When I travel I always appreciate finding historic districts. Bukchon is an old neighborhood made up of mostly classic style Korean homes. You can meander down and around small alleys and there are surprises along the way. I was lucky enough to have a sweet snack being cooked in the doorway of an older man's home. Not sure what it was, but it was like a carmel cookie. Very yummy! The other good thing is that it is an easy walk from Bukchon to the Palace so if you like to walk, you can see a lot in an afternoon."
I wanna live here!!!!,Actually this was my second time in seoul. I have heard about this village which is near the palace but I got no time to visit back then until this trip. And I was regret I didn't do that on the first trip. It was amazing and lovely village. You might get a bit tired from climbing up the slope but trust me it's worth. The area is really big so I suggest you guys to go to the information Center for the village and the staff will show u on the map which way to go and what is interesting to see so you don't have to walk the whole area and save a lot of time. Along the village track you can see a lot of houses that open for a small museum or a craft shops. For some reason you can also rent and try on the Korean tradition dress Hanbok for 7000 won. If you are a big group of people pls noticed that silence is required for this area!!
cute collection of ancient houses,"Up a set of stairs and along narrow passageways are lots of old (looking) houses that follow the ancient design for this area of the city. It has been renovated loads but there is still a strong sense of what it was. In amongst the grand houses are fancy shops, museums, and galleries."
Overrated Tourist Trap,"I would say avoid this as it is mostly a tourist trap, with shops all over the place. Instead visit the Namsan Hanok Village, it is quieter, cleaner and is pretty much the same thing."
Old Korea ,This is a wonderful walking tour of an area of Seoul that had been somewhat preserved. People still live here and there are signs everywhere asking to respect their privacy. Stop at the Bunchok information center first to get a map of the area then hit the streets with your camera. A wonderful flash from the past. Great views of traditional Korean rooftops. 
awesome,"walked with two young children...everyone enjoyed the day. stopped to buy souvenirs, ate street food, took tons of pics of architecture...wish we had known about guest houses in area!!"
Nice to get away from the city,Nice place to stroll around. It shows some of the Korean history. It is worth having a look around - you get away from all the busy streets of the city. On a nice sunny day you can get great photos.
Very cute,They houses were great to see. Very traditional and very nice. I found myself getting disorientated a bit but there are many info centers around that can help set you straight. The maps are good and in English and the street signs also have English.Cute shops and some nice street food.
Hipster street and wonderful,"The main commercial thoroughfare in Bukchon has a ton of adorable shops, stores and coffee places. It's also immediately quieter from the 6 lane streets, so you can easily wander and window shop. I also loved the residential area of Bukchon but because it's a populated residential area, it is a bit awkward to be wandering with packs of other tourists around people's homes. There are a lot of signs up asking people to be respectful, and the residential area is technically only open until sundown - but most streets I turned down had several dozen people on them. It's hard to keep several dozen tourists quiet. You won't be able to wander and absorb the feel of the place easily so I'd recommend checking it out briefly and then heading back to the more commercial area to explore some intriguing alleys and shops. "
to feel Korea's quiet atmosphere,"For photographer and walker. I like this place. Very quiet at day and night. There is one place 'Garage coffee', roof terrace with nice view, draft beer and foreign waitress."
a glimpse of the past,"this is probably my favorite place in Seoul, as I went there twice in my one week of stay! you feel like you've traveled back through time and every street corner is perfect to capture some great pictures! there's also many shops and coffee places that are tucked in the little streets, it's a nice escape if you want some quiet time and walk around the old housing and tea houses- it's truly a beautiful area to visit! "
Alternative to shopping,"one of the best places in Seoul to visit on a lazy afternoon durin winter.If you're into nostalgic and quaint-stuff, then Bukchon Village is the ideal place to visit."
Great place,"A very unique experience in this place, spent half a day strolling in the alleys, observing Korean traditional houses and take a lot of photos in the process. Made our presence as quiet as possible to avoid causing disturbance for the local residents as we saw reminders on the wall."
You should go there,"Authentic village Seoul, with wooden houses, great view to city. You must keep silence, staff on the streets help tourists."
Charming,"Despite the swarm of tourists, this is a charming area to wander and where one can experience what Seoul was like before the high rises arrived. "
Walk and Marvel at the beauty of Bukcon,"Visited this in July 2014. Started off from the tourist center at Bukchon. Took off on its suggested route. It is a beautiful neighbourhood. There are Tourist Helpers along the route who can speak English, Chinese and Japanese to guide the visitors. Lots to see around the neighbourhood with shops, eateries, places of interests."
Lost in time,"What a great use of time if you want to see something that takes you back time 700 years. What fascinating architecture that you can touch and sense. As you walk the streets and view the houses, you are able to step into some of them and and see what the elite class considered their homes. There are not many places where you can see and touch history."
It's just a neighborhood.,"This was probably my biggest disappointment in Seoul. Yes, the houses are somewhat old-fashioned, but you can see similar architecture all over Korea. Personally, I felt like I and the other tourists were being very intrusive - it is a residential area, after all. I'd only check it out if you happen to be in the area, and even then I wouldn't stay for more than a few minutes."
Scenic place,"We enjoyed a nice walk through this neighborhood and took many photos. Although is was packed for the Lunar New Year, we managed to escape the crowd by leaving the main path.Great area to see how the people used to live. May photo opportunities.Grab a map from the small tourist stalls in the area. They suggest different kind of walks and good explanations."
Wouldn't see it anywhere else. Go high ,"Get lost in the side streets and explore. The higher you go the more you can see. Narrow streets that overlook the city below. Worth hiking up the hills for a unique perspective of the architecture.very touristy with lots of popup shops. Some homes open for a fee. I heard one say 800 won each just to go inside and look, no thanks, found a free one around the corner.Take your time and get lost. You'll find your way back eventually. "
Unique place for photos,"I like those charms of traditional Korean houses and the simplicity of beauty.It was a sunny day in winter, all wonderful scenes."
Great Experience,It's fab place to be to see how the OLD korea looks like. It's a short walk but it's worth it. I took so many pic there.
Unique perspective ,The architecture is beautiful in this historic area and you really get a sense for what the city might have felt like a few hundred years ago. It was really neat. 
We were having fun with Hanbok.,"Hanbok is the traditional Korean dress with vibrant colours. To try on it, you have to pay 7000 won including entry fee. Nice place to have fun and feeling Korean traditional culture there. You should try!"
Huge Hanok Village,"Hanok Village in the big city of modern Seoul. Should join the ""Bokchon Hanok Village Walking Tour"" for the first time to check out the important points."
Charming,"Bukchon is a lovely area, well worth exploring. Old-school Korean architecture and lots of independent cafes and restaurants serving authentic Korean cuisine. Also art galleries and shopping. Not to be missed."
Bukchon: traditional Korean housing renovated for today's living!,"Bukchon is one of the most delightful areas in Seoul to spend and hour or two comparing old Korean hanoks(not so many of them as more are being renovated every year) as they were originally built with beautifully renovated hanock for today's modern living. It is both interesting and informative to see how the modelling of these houses are enhanced with the use of pale wood panelling and modern fittings.Some hanok owners are offering home stay experiences, well worth a visit if not one or two night's stay!"
Absolutely Go and experience the Charm of an Old Seoul Village,"Just like some of parts of Tokyo, I love the low rise, old neighbourhoods that have been renovated but have kept the charm of an Old Seoul Village. It's walkable, and a lovely combination of the old with new shops and cafés. Charming! "
Like traveling back in time,"Going here really does feel like stepping in a different place and time, so very different from Seoul's modern buildings. We had a free walking tour from the Korea Visit Org (highly recommended, the guides speak good English and are very friendly -- plus it's free) and it was enjoyable.Only thing is the entire walk can be very tiring, especially the uphill areas. My two elderly companions didn't enjoy it as much because of all the walking. Wear good shoes, maybe trim your itinerary a bit if you're short on time. This is a place best made for slower walks and absorbing the scenery."
Where history comes back to life,"I went there very early in the morning thinking that there would be less people and easy to get around. I was right! It can be a bit difficult to find your way and manage to see everything, but there are maps and dirrections to help you. Even if it is a turistic area, people live there, so try to keep your voice down a bit!(just a small advice)"
Good for taking photo,A nice place to visit. There are many Korean style houses which are in good condition. 
Traditional bukchon residences,"If you have time, do make a visit here to view the architecture and streets of this residential area. Views from some of the streets are awesome!"
Walk through the Past,It was nice to walk through an old neighborhood. So much of Korea has been modernized that it is nice to imagine what it would have been like.
Traditional Style House,Great way to spend an afternoon. Great for strolling and exploring. You can pick up a map with a suggested route at the tourist office at the foot of the neighborhood if you like.
urban hustle and bustle old and new,"Great area with very old architecture beside very new buildings. Great little shops with a focus on creativity and arts and crafts. Great walking around with some cardio up those hills (but then you can go down, too). Definitely a spot to go while in modern Seoul for a taste of the past."
What a great experience,"Bukchon...I've always wanted to visit it ever since I watched a Korean drama with my favorite actor Lee Min Ho which was filmed there...I did get a chance to finally visit the place in the fall. I was amazed at the number of narrow streets, traditional hanok houses and modern cars parked in front of them. Lots of tiny traditional tea houses are located on the main street leading up to Bukchon, which I visited. So many things aside from sightseeing can be done in Bukchon, but I only had a few hours to spare on the day I visited. There are cultural experience venues, traditional pottery and jewelry stores. You can even stay overnight in one of the specified houses. When you get to the top you have a fantastic view of old vs modern Korea with hanoks by your feet and modern Seoul skyscrapers in the distance. A paradise for a photography enthusiast such as myself. I will definitely be back there, and would recommend going to Bukchon to everyone. What a great experience. As I mentioned, I went in the fall, so everything looked twice as beautiful with fall foliage. Oh, and I did get to find the filming drama house location which I was ecstatic about."
Nice place to wander,"Get a map from the Bukchon Cultural Center before wander through the streets and alleys of Bukchon. Do note that it's rather commercialized, with cafes and retail stores that is far from traditional. But still interesting..."
Traditional Village,See and take photos in this traditional hanok village in seoul. Takes a lot of walking uphill though but it's all worth it.
A mini glimpse at traditional Hanok villages. But for a more pure experience head to Gyeongju near Busan. ,"This is a good experience to see traditional Korean housing without leaving Seoul, but it's crammed with tourists like everywhere in Korea. However the buildings are cute and it's a nice place to spend an afternoon with good weather. If on a limited schedule and you can't make it to Gyeongju check this out instead. "
Great Part of a Walking Tour Of Seoul,"Let me just say that having lived in Seoul for two years, I developed a walking tour route for when people visited. This attraction is part of that tour that can be lengthened or shortened as needed. The general route was: Begin at City Hall, walk up through Gwanghwamun Square visiting the Cheonggyecheon Stream and a possible visit to Hangul Museum under statue, continue to Gyeongbukgung Palace. Time permitting walk up through Samcheongdong into the Bukchon Hanok Village, continue down to where the tour ends in Insadong. This is enough for just about a full day of touring and requires A LOT of walking.One of the interesting things about Bukchon is that it is in a sense a 'living museum.' People still live here and these are still active houses. Looking down the narrow streets over the roof lines really gives you an idea of what Seoul might have looked like long ago.Being one of the major tourism spots in Seoul, there are a lot of tourist trap type shops and cafes. But, all round this area are some really great traditional tea shops and even little art galleries tucked away. It's worth doing some exploring. As touristy as it is, it is not as bad as Insadong and tends to be far less crowded.Well worth the walk up for a vist!"
Don't miss this!!,"This is absolutely fantastic! Bukchon is a traditional Korean hanok village in the heart of Seoul. The hanok houses are so beautiful, and I couldn't stop taking photos. It is possible to go inside some of the houses, and you can also buy morning or afternoon tea and just enjoy the atmosphere of this amazing place. The streets are quite steep, but it is definitely worth making the effort to navigate your way through them. And you'll find some great views over Seoul too. I would highly recommend a visit to Bukchon."
Very different,"Bukchon is a place to go if you are into something different, unique for photography. You feel like you kind of step back in time a bit there with the architecture. Traditional village and some unique shopping can be done there."
Beautiful yet Not enough,"been to this place the morning before our flight going back home (manila). though im satisfied seeing the hanok, but i would love to experience going inside and see how traditional houses were arranged. unfortunately, we were not able to follow the tour map and were not able to reach the highlight of the hanok village (where the abundant hanoks are located). dont forget to try a mango dessert at philippines dessert cafe. :)how to get here?we took a train from myeongdong. the nearest subway station is Anguk (orange line, line 3). take exit 3, walk few meters and take left turn for Gyedong-gil (road/street).For tour map, visit this site and print the map: http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&art_id=58509&lang=en&m=0004004004001&p=04"
living museum,"Bukchon is like a living museum, right in the middle of the city and within walking distance from the main tourist attractions in Seoul, namely Gyeongbokgung, Insadong and Gwanghwamun Square. Having said that, there are people living in the well-preserved village. Unfortunately, tourists did not think about that fact when they shouted at each other like it was an area full of residential buildings and nothing else. Because of this, there are signboards seeking tourists to keep their voices down which seemed to be ignored.It was nice to get lost in the village but it does not hurt to get a copy of the map from the tourist information counter at the beginning of the road.There are a plenty of hanok villages in Seoul alone. This is probably the most popular one due to its location and wonderful hilly view with photo opportunity spots you may find along the way."
Traditional Village Remind me my school days,"Defiantly worth to visit to bukchon if you want to feel true atmosphere of Korea , especially traditional village is very lovely , gotta walk a bit but there is signage on the street in English and there is even a tourist information office to assist you when you lost your way , you can spend the whole day wondering around the area ,this is one of the best place we visited in Seoul ! If you are the type who appreciates and like to experience local attractions Bukchon is the place to visit in Seoul"
Not so impress with old town,"The area is nice filling with coffee shop and nice shopping area. However, I am not very impressed for the old town part. It is nice to visit but don't expect too much."
Pity the Residents,"With so many noisy tourists milling around this small area, I felt kinda bad for the poor residents who have to endure this inconvenience day in day out. Some of the *ahem Chinese ahem* tourists were even screaming at each other to align themselves for the ""perfect"" ""jump shot"". (Dear me!)People talk about this place like a teleport to ancient times, but it's hardly the case, unless old roofs and old doors are your kind of history tours. There were no shops open when we were there (some of the houses have been converted to run-of-the-mill souvenir shops), but to see them open would probably affect the atmosphere even more!"
Beautiful Hanok Village & the cathedral,"I've visited Bukchon with my mom in one of the coldest winter day, but it was definitely worth all the chills! Its a must see sight if you are interested in Korean traditional culture and its old architecture style. Theres a free cultural museum/gallery along the hike so make sure to stop by and take a peek. (They sell souvenirs like postcards and magnets in there, too.) Last but not least, small tip for Catholics who visit Bukchon - Theres a cathedral nearby called Gahoe-dong Catholic Church, which is a historical place for the Catholic Church of Korea. The cathedral itself is a mixture of Korean Hanok and Western-style architecture which is worth a visit."
Worth a trip,Its interesting to see the old style of housing and the juxtaposition of the old and new architecture in the area. We also went to the Bukchon Traditional Crafts Experience Center there and had fun doing crafts.
A gem in Seoul,"Located in Insa-Dong, Bukchon Hanok village is easily one of the best places we visited in Seoul. The ancient traditional Korean houses are beautiful. People still live there although commercialization has taken place where houses have been sold to be converted into shops, restaurants and cafes.We patronised one of the cafes, not just to have a coffee break, but also to experience a hanok. We were given a room where we had to sit on the floor round a low table. The architecture is interesting and the sliding doors similar to traditional Japanese houses. The view from the balcony overlooking the village was really awesome. (The café was located at the top of the hill.)If you are the type who appreciates and like to experience local attractions, Bukchon is the place to visit in Seoul. In fact, the entire Insa-Dong district is lovely with its Korean-themed shops that sell wares different from what you normally get at mall and even Myeong-Dong."
Favorite Place in Seoul,I LOVED THIS PLACE.You can spend the whole day wandering around this area. Traditional design buildings and cute indie craft shops and cafes a genuinely beautiful part of the city
Nice place filled with Hanok (Traditional Korea Houses),"This place is beautiful, gotta walk abit but there's signage on the streets in English. There's even a tourist information office to assist you when you lost your way.It's definitely worth the walk up the slope. A nice place to look around and take a stroll. "
Traditional vileage,Definitely worthy to visit to Bukchon if you want to feel the true atmosphere of Korea. Especially the traditional vileage is very lovely.
No Regret,Easy to find.. stop at anguk exit 2 so cool place and i miss to get back here next year.. many hand made store that i love the moat of Korea
Very pleasant stroll around the alleys,Very pleasant stroll around the alleys and neighbourhood. The Customs and arts are excellent. People are very nice. I dined in a couple of traditional Korean Restaurants in the neighborhood and they are very delicious and reasonably priced.
Quaint and quiet,"The streets of Bukchon are lined with many hanoks or Korean traditional houses. These hanoks are protected against modern development so you can see and feel the aura of old-style Korea. As the place is situated on the mountain, it is rather steep and hilly so do be careful when walking around the place. The hanoks are privately-owned so people still live there. Due to that, there are many signs along the way reminding tourists to be quiet as so to mantain peace and quietness of the place. The main street of Bukchon has many hanok-styled cafes where you can grab a cup of coffee whilst soaking up the atmosphere. If you get lost, fret not because there are many tourist information staffs around the place and they'd be happy to give you directions or answer any of your questions."
Old part of Seoul,"This corner of Seoul is a must see, if you want to experience the old part of the city. Be sure to pick up a map at the tourist information and follow their walking route to see all the best streets. You get great views of the city too, especially the Namsan tower. Best come later in the day and take in the sunset."
Unique Hanok House,"We were here by Nov 2014 after we visited Changdekgong. We saw many unique and magnificent Hanok houses. Most of the Hanok had changed to guesthouse. It's good attraction to know these traditional Korean people living places. Also we can saw some wall paintings with beautiful picture, very cute and special."
Bukchon,"I stayed in a traditional house and slept on the floor for 2 nights. It was a little hard for my old bones but I enjoyed the experience. It was fun to walk around the neighborhood and see all the old houses. note:( I was there in April 2013, not 2014 but was not given that choice)."
Small corner of paradise,"This would have received five stars had we not visited similar areas in Jeonjo and near Andong. Nonetheless, it was a treat to see these traditional structures preserved and to wander about. Interesting cultural center with excellent maps. I think I would have really enjoyed the culture/art making classes at the center if had had more time or in warmer weather!"
Get your souvenirs here,I was ready to go home almost empty-handed. Then I came by Bukchon hours before my return flight... Very interesting things you could buy for your loved ones back home!
Traditional Korean archtectural beauty,"It is a great place to appreciate Korean archtectural beauty and functionality. It is also interesting to see how people actually live in these traditional structure with modern improvement. It is hilly but worth the cardio. There are several work shops you can vist and learn some of traditional craft. It is also close to the major touristic spots (e.g., palace or Insadong or the temple)."
Worth a visit!,Its really worth a pay to visit. I enjoyed walking around the area and seeing the architectural aspects of the houses and how the entire alleys are meticulously planned. Its a good example of having the old and the new. 
Well worth a visit to walk around these lovely traditional hanok.,"Seoul's Bukchon Hanok Village is a traditional Korean village with a long history located not too far from the Gyeongbok Palace and Changdeok Palace and is well worth a few hours to explore and take in the culture. The traditional village is composed of lots of alleys, ""hanok"", and is preserved to show a 600-year-old urban environment, but it is a residential area with people living in the traditional wooden and stone houses and so you need to respect that when you walk around the hanok.As well as the lovely architecture of the traditional homes there are plenty of shops, craft centres drinking and eating places to spend your time exploring. Pick up a map from the tourist information office as you enter the Bukchon Hanok area as this I found was a great help in navigating my way around the narrow streets. It was very popular and very busy with tourists so expect to be one of many as you walk this fabulous historic district. It is rather steep walking in places so probably not suitable for those in wheelchairs or those whom are not in great fitness."
hilly walk.,"quite boring. shops and restaurants, not much really.But! there is a free shuttle bus right at the turn where the main palace Geongbukgong and the Hyundai art gallery. There is free shuttle bus service in front of the Hyundai gallery thatvtakes you to Sam Cheng Geok, a beautiful traditional Korean residence preserved on the hills with fresh air and trails. Kuch is delicious there at the Sam Cheng Geuk but pricey. "
Cater about 2 hours for your walk,Its a series of well-preserved village houses with some nice views at the top. Be prepared for some steep climbs along some parts of the route though. There is a tourist information office along the way so go in if you have to and get your necessary directions from inside. We took about 2 hours for the walk at a casual pace.
Traditional experience,"If you are interested in history and culture, you will love walking around this historical and yet modern region. Beautiful hanok buildings, combined with the vew on the mountains, pine trees and bamboo wil emerge painter in you. There are shops and excellent restaurants as well."
Bukchon -an interesting neigbourhood in Seoul,Do TaKe a walking trip in Bukchon. There is a tourist information booth where you can get a map for a walking tour! You might not find all routes and photospots without it. 
What a great Village,"Next time I go back would like to stay in a Traditional Korean wooden home, kitted out with all the latest hi teach amenities. Worth a walk around. Good restaurants around."
Unique and people still living there,"Whenever you visited an old village, one would think it is a show case. In this case, this is real life though the building dated back some 500 years ago. They have couple of houses open to visitors to see inside.It is only available to visit before sunset to give residence some privacy. The area outside the old village is also very interesting with cafe and restaurant', also very near to president residence."
Nice place to walk around,"Lives up to its name. Lots of nice buildings to admire. Just walk around and explore the tiny narrow streets to see what's around the corner. When tired, just find a nice cafe to rest and have a hot drink."
Traditional homes and architecture,A must see if you like to see traditional architectural homes. Need walking shoes since it is a nice area to see the sights.
Extremely beautiful place,Walking in Bokchon and admiring the Hanok was one of the best experiences we had in Seoul. We visited all the 8 scenery and couldn't understand why some people advised travelers to start from scenery 3. They are all so unique and beautiful. 
Well Preserved Village Houses,"Went there on our last day in Seoul. It was very cold but we were so glad that we managed to squeeze this itinerary in. This is just a small village but as we were rushing for time, we didn't managed to visit the Traditional Culture Centre and probably covered only about 60% of the village alleys / streets. Definitely worth a return trip.I really enjoyed admiring the well preserved and maintained traditional houses in the area. Some streets are filled with quaint looking little cafes (unfortunately they were mostly closed, even at 11am) and various souvenir / handicraft shops. We bought some hand-painted ceramic paintings and art prints in some of the shops there. A friend gave me a Buchon Walking Map. Not sure where she got it from, perhaps the Tourist Info Centre or the Culture Centre. You can use the map to guide you around the alleyway, focusing on your area of interest. Do take note though that some streets are very steep, and in winter, it can get really tricky, to manage the slippery streets (due to the melting snow). My kids and I came upon this section near the top of the hill, where the street was extremely slippery. We met a group of tourists there and a few of them almost slipped, while trying to navigate up the hilly road."
Only visit if you like traditional designs and buildings,"We just visited the Bukchon Village last week (10/Dec) and we loved it. As we went on a weekday afternoon, the place was quite deserted and peaceful. Moreover it is chilly and nice weather for a stroll around the place taking plenty of photos.. haha..We had a nice time moving around at a leisurely pace just getting the vibe and feel of the whole place.However in order to fully enjoy this place (in my opinion), you need to be relaxed and really like looking at the different structure of the Hanoks. We were on our own Free & Easy trip so we had no time restrictions... haha.. and go on a weekday, it seems alot of ppl will visit over the weekends...I feel sorry for the residents there over the weekends with all the crowd...Anyway be prepared to walk around and take photos...Getting there is easy: take the Line 3 to Anguk station and exit @ Exit 2.Just go straight for about 300m and there is an information booth. Take a map and walking guide and just follow the ""suggested"" route.. haha..Have fun..."
Glad this type of culture is highlighted,I am so glad I made the trip out here. Easy to get to via subway with just a short walk. As I made my way through the windy streets I really enjoyed the care that people take to keep the streets and homes so well maintained. There are a lot of little alleys to explore and still stay oriented to where you are.Stop by the visitor office if you care to get a quick map to help navigate the streets. 
Pretty village but nothing really interesting,"Freezing cold to walk around the village. There were some houses open for visitors to look around to get a feel of the history of the place. But other than that, I did not quite enjoy it. We were lucky we were with a private tour company that had local guides who knew how to bring us to the top of a church that had a birds eye view of the village. That was the highlight of a rather dull place. Hmmmm.... nothing else to talk about it really....."
Olds in very modern city,"Many traditional houses in use. And also many well-interiored shops and cafes there.Chosun dynasty is living in the very modern city, Seoul.Old royal palace and other hot points are in walking distance."
The best long walks during winter time,Long walks during winter time is killing with the wind blowing pretty strong but we have a wonderful time at the Bukchon Hanok Village. Took lots of pictures and there are many shops to buy little cute items for yourself and as souvenirs.
Stunning,"after few days shopping with friends. I enjoyed my last day in Seoul by walk around Bukchon in the morning, with coffee and dessert, nice and quiet. Nice place to take pictures."
Incredible views!!!,"Lots of traditional homes still preserved from the olden days. I went here on mid May and it was still chilly. So bring your jackets during any season. You have to walk a lot from the station and the place is quite hilly so sneakers are recommended. The neighborhoods are a mix of traditional and modern houses. People live inside. Lots of flowers blooming on early summer. The roads were quite narrow and scenic. Excellent for pictures. It was great cultural experience. If you don't care about culture, don't bother with it. You might find it Uninteresting.I was very tired of walking towards the end of my journey there, so I rested in a Cafe And had some shaved ice cream with red bean paste and rice cake. The portion was big but still it was overpriced, in my opinion. Actually, everything in there is more pricey than anywhere else. It's a stylish little town. And I bet the merchants know tourists go there so it's expected, I guess.Despite the cold weather and aching feet, I still really enjoyed my trip there. Definitely recommend!!!! ♡"
memorable,Like the fact that it's free of charge.. and we can wear hanbok with a mere 3 dollars rent price.. picture taken in traditional house OMG I felt like in a movie...
Place to visit in winters?,How s d place to explore it in the winters ?Please suggest as its too chill outside ...Reviews are tempting me to visit d place
Historical Serenity,I love all the buildings and the view. Historic and amazing experiences. Tourists have to be quiet and walk slowly because of the signboards hung all over the wall that required us to be quiet as the historic and classic buildings are housing areas.
If you're in it for Culture,"I just like the idea of an old heritage village wherever it may be. Luckily Seoul has it with Bukchon. It's a nice feeling to get lost in here. Surprises await for wanderers alike. Here we wore traditional silk hanbok and tried imagining how it is to live in ancient Korea. Great experience! Dislikes - Hmnn... Sometimes we got into a private property or we struck a dead end. I hope more signposts would help DIY travelers like us who do not depend on tours. Other than that, the place is amazing!"
If you want to traditional houses.,"If you want to traditional houses, here is the best place. And it is also very near Insadong and Samchungdong where traditional couveniers and luxury boutique shops are located in."
Beautiful place!,"The area has lots of beautiful housing that one rarely has the opportunity to see elsewhere. Most are distinct with its own character and all are beautifully designed and decorated. There were signs reminding people to keep their volume down especially from the evening onwards out of consideration for the residents. Many quaint shops and cafes in the area too. However, there are many stairs and steep slopes which might make it difficult for some."
Nice place!,there is really nice place!. wonderful traditional village!
A lot of walking,Nice walk around the neighbourhood. You can see old style houses and visit some sites in the area. Get the map from the visitor centre on the main road. It's not recommended for people who cannot walk for long as there is a lot of uphill walking. We struggled to push our child's stroller. Lots of cafes and eateries at Samcheongdong and in the neighbourhood. 
Very busy and just OK,"I've been here a couple of times and each time I was underwhelmed. The last time I visited I brought a friend who was passing through Korea, to say he was unimpressed is an understatement. It's a real shame that this area is not more interesting. It is a historic area but it feels very manufactured and sterile. You do not get the impression this is what Korea used to be like. Couple this manufactured feel with the huge crowds and it's just not a great place to visit. If I didn't live in Seoul, I probably would not have visited here. If you don't have much time to spend in Seoul, I would go other places."
Really Interesting,really enjoyed this neighborhood. Definitely worth seeing and walking around. A Must see in my opinion.
Live museum,(+) This is a village with traditional Korean houses with people still living in them so it's like a living museum.
Gives you a sense of the old Korean community,"Walking through the streets of Bukchon make you feel like you're walking through the past. It's a nice place capture the essense of the old wooden house community. Even if commercial stores have occupied some of these houses along the roads, you can still see some odd shops like a hat making shop, a tailoring shop, an old style barber shop, where the owners themselves are still making the crafts themselves. It is also nice to turn into the small alleys and see the locals going on with their daily chores."
Explore but please be quiet,"The Bukchon village is a residential area and while we go around walking about the rows and rows of well-preserved (if not, designed & constructed) hanok style houses, we were reminded to keep noise at a minimum in order not to disturb the families that live there. You don't want a tourist peering into your house, do you? Enjoy the sights and photograph all you want but give respect to the privacy of families that reside there. We descended at Samcheondong for some food and drinks and to rest our legs."
Lots of walking!,This is a very interesting part of the city. It is like a city within a city and most of the homes are preserved with the old ways of building. Lots of shopping too! Make sure you have comfy shoes on for this tour! 
No Regret,This place is so cozy.. many cafe many unique store.. old houses arround you.. you can spent whole day here.. i sure you no regret to come here.. i will gonna miss this place..
Seeing the Old Seoul,"Yes, I'm a Lee Min Ho fan, so I made it a point to find the Sanggojae in the Bukchon Hanok Village where Lee Min Ho shoot for the Perfect Match koreanovela! The village is perfect for architecture enthusiasts who want to get a taste of the old Seoul. Perfect for a visit after your tour in the Gyeongbokgung Palace. "
Not so much fit for travellers in wheelchair,The area is quite hilly and it's difficult to explore more than the main street (which also goes up hill).The houses are old and many of them require you to use stairs to enter or to visit the basement.So my experience there was short and unsatisfying.We did try some local snacks and they were good.
"great experience, great architectures","Must visit if you have time, its an uphill and traditional korean housing area, very nice , tidy and clean, lots of houses to take photos with and coffee strips just below the hill. you can get maps from nearby volunteer staffs or tourism board staffs they will guide you around the place with markings on the map. Yes its in korean words but its not too bad with the map. there's an observatory somewhere around the area, where you can have a clearer look and a taste of entering traditional korean housing."
Nice traditional place for photo-taking,"This is one of the beautiful places in Seoul where travellers may wish to consider. I loved the traditional looking houses and it makes me feels like Iiving in a warmth environment. Going to this place is not difficult and it is about 300 m walk from Anguk station with tourist information signage to guide along. If you crave for coffee while walking to Bukchon, you may wish to pamper yourself with a cup of Americano coffee from ""unlimited coffee"" and I am sure you will like the aroma."
Trip to the past!,"It was a very nice day when we went to Bukchon. Walking around w/ a map, while eating some red-bean manjoos, everything was going so very well. That is... Until my friends saw that we had to hike a bit to get to some of the other areas. The place was very nice and there's a tour, but you had to pay for it - We opted to go around the place on our own. The houses were very pretty and around the place, there are shops! There was one which sold little succulents and another one which sold clothes. The most interesting one is the quaint store that sold pen drawings! The details were amazing and it's done by just one person! My friends bought a few of his pieces, actually! Anyway, past the traditional houses, there's an area w/ more modern stuff - more shops and restaurants! Very nice place and the ambiance is great!"
Nice traditional houses of Korea,This is a must visit place if you go to Seoul. We got there by subway. Alight at Anguk station (line 3) and exit at #2. You can find a tourist information centre not far away and they will advise where are the places to visit. This place is really beautiful.
Photographer's Delight,"This village of traditional homes is probably the only single-family homes that you'll see in a city of high-rise living. The character is well maintained, there are good restaurants, galleries and shops, and a lovely view of the Seoul Tower. Don't forget to also walk through Insadong."
A good walk.,We came because we wanted to see traditional houses. It turns out to be really beautiful and clean. Wish there was more things to do around. It was a little hike and then there was all.
Back in time in Bukchon,"Bukchon is a pretty historic neighborhood in Seoul. The architecture is uniform, unique and typically Korean. Beautiful!The nice thing is, that it is not 'just' historic architecture. The area is also filled with galleries and cafes. Very cool.Read more here:http://curlytraveller.com/2014/02/bukchon-hanok-village-seoul.html"
naaaah... is that it??!!,we were soooooo disappointed in visiting this place. going up is a challenge then when you reach the village all we can say is.. is that it!!!??!!?? i thought i could see the traditional old houses. not worth it! better look for other place to visit
Hiltop views of Seoul are enticing,"I went because I had wanted to see a ""traditional Korean village"" and a friend had recommended it to me. I had me imagined a model village for tourists to see what traditional style Korean houses look like. However, upon arriving at Bukchon, it turned out to be a neighbourhood that happen to have a lot of traditional style Korean houses with real people living there in. The neighbourhood is on a hillside and so a lot of places it's quite steep. You also get some pretty amazing views and there is also an observatory that you can go to. Go in the day time so you can see the views. There are volunteer tourist guides all around that supply you with a map of the places to see in the area. Also just down the road there are some really good and inexpensive restaurants. There are some cute shops, cafes, and restaurants tucked in unexpected places."
Beautiful Old village,All the small houses and road are very interesting. You seems to travel back in time and walk on the streets that history walk on. Just like going to Paris or other old Europe city.
Charming and authentic area of Seoul,"Strolling through the streets of Bukchon you will get a completely different feeling from the one you can get in the other neighbourhoods of Seoul. Bukchon has an ancient and charming look but maintains the fashionable, hip and cool bars and cafés that are typical of the city. You can go shopping here, but also eat in an authentic small Korean restaurant or have an afternoon break on a rooftop, while watching the sun set.Definitely worth a visit!"
"Real, tiny and very interesting","It is a very tight place to navigate around as a tall person, and the streets would not be good if crowded, but people are still living in these places that are hundreds of years old and incredibly basic. I went mid week, and found a local guide for a few dollars who gave me a good and informative tour in English. After the megalopolis of Seoul and Gangnam, it is a simple and lovely space and a quick visit."
old city,"Nicely renovated, quite authentic, wear comfy shoes for lots of walking on narrow streets. This is a historic area where you can see how people lived before the 20th century."
Both touristic and authentic,"BukChon is a great place to visit. The obvious reason is what every guide mentions: a look at a traditional village, and great views over JongNo, DongDaeMun, NamSan from the top of the hill. Obviously, BukChon delivers, although one could argue that the village is not overly impressive or that there are better places in town to get a great cityscape panorama. But there's a unique flavor to BukChon. It remains it's touristic flavor, with small museums, shops and trendy restaurants. But at the same time, it doesn't feel overblown like InSaDong. There's a right balance, as between touristic shops, you might run into people cleaning their cars, kids coming back from school, and more simply, people going on about their life in this nice, quiet environment. The atmosphere is really what sets this place apart, and I recommend strolling around without a map to get a real glimse at what BukChon has to offer."
"Charming village and beautiful scenery, perfect for a weekday afternoon","This old village is a charm, but be careful to go on a weekday instead of holidays or weekends as there could easily be a crowd in this popular tourist attraction. It's much more enjoyable if there were less people walking alongside you on the rather narrow streets. Quite a number of lovely cafes and boutique shops here, though the price is on the higher range, you would definitely appreaciate their uniqueness and novelty. Rather than offer coffee, some cafes here provide specialty teas and desserts. You definitely would not want to miss trying those set in the beautiful backdrop of the Bukchon traditional houses and the Inwangsan Mountain and Bukaksan Mountain nearby! Some of the tables are even made of stone and have ""ponds"" in the middle of them. How interesting is that!"
Quiet and fun,There are many traditional house hotels (hostels) around that you may stay and experience Seoul's traditions and welcome. 
Traditional korean culture ,"Went there on a sunday afternoon, it was nice walking on the streets and seeing the tradutuinal Korean houses, there is also an activity center kind of thing where yoh can go and make handmade jewellery and dye some cloth in the old korean way. I think a lot of things were shut there maybe because of a sunday so olease check before going there."
seeing Korean traditional houses in the city,"You can visit Bukchon Hanok Village if you want to see Korean traditional houses in the city. Unlikely Namsangol Hanok Village, this is a real village where residents are living. You can take your time, looking around cultural centers, guesthouses, restaurants and tea houses, and at the same time feeling traditional Korean culture."
"The ""old"" Korea, just right in town !","To be honest, I didn't plan to go there. My plant destination was the Changgyeonggung Palace, but it was closed (Mondays!)Hence I looked for something else and found Bukchon Hanok Village. It was certainly a good compensation for not being able to visit another Palace. I was strolling around for almost two hours. Just outstanding! "
Stroll and enjoy,"plenty to eat, see and do in Bukchon. See the traditional homes, antiques and shops, nice restaurants and coffee houses. Wonderful walking around the area. Go 'up Bukchon' towards Seongbuk-dong. Hit the old city wall. Next door is Samcheong-dong, insa-dong and the palace. Really worth your time - especially on a beautiful seoul day. "
Bukchon Hanok Village has restored Korean wooden houses,"A lovely area to stroll among a remnant of the Joseon dynasty (1392-1910) where you can view restored Korean wooden homes plus galleries, cafes, and shops. Hilly streets that reminded me of San Francisco. Great views. We reached it by taking subway line 1 to Jongno 3-a, then transferring to line 3 to Anguk."
Bukchon is good place to see the traditional korean houses,Bukchon is good place to see the traditional korean houses. and it is near samcheong-dong where you can see many boutique shops.
Wonderfully scenic walking route,"You don't really have to do much research to locate the best photography spots here because they have people (and a tourist information counter) placed throughout this residential area to lead tourists around with a proper Buckhon Hanok village map. On the other hand, if you are searching for some houses which may have been used as filming locations, you will have to come prepared as these information are not disclosed (rightfully so, as to not disturb the residents of those houses). All in all, there are a lot of tourists around the area so silence is vital to maintain its peaceful nature. Come prepared with a good pair of shoes though, as the climb can be pretty steep (especially for the elderly)."
Absolutely stunning,I love almost everything in Bukchon. Well except that you may need to go up the steep roads. But you'll love the view up there. I started from Samcheongdong. Less climbing than to those who started from Anguk Station. 
Antique korean style architectural,"It is a place full of korean traditional hanok houses. Most of the hanok houses are currently with residents stay inside. Therefore, you can only take picture and admire its architectural design from the outside of houses. Some houses are developed into shops such as coffee shop, tea shops, fashion shops, etc. It is a pleasant neighbourhood with nice and ancient architecture."
My legs were screaming...,"We climbed up from Samcheong side (Kyeongbok Goong east gate), following the map given by the red moving tourist info girls. Make sure your legs are ready for the extremely steep staircases. Definitely not for elderly and those who are afraid of height."
great point for photo shooting and cultural view,"i stayed at bukchon during my visit at korea.the best time to visit bukchon is early in the morning before 8am cause it is not crowded. so, this is the best time for you to shoot a nice photo.then ,enjoy your delicious breakfast at bukchon area.please get a map of bukchon from the bukchon tourism center before you walk around bukchon.if you visit at the right time, you may enjoy their cultural monthly show for free as well. please checked the schedule before you depart."
Well worth the visit,"We visited a renovated Hanok house and received a guided tour with tea after. Plan to spend the afternoon as there is so much to see. There are other small museums and many shops. Look for the people in red shirts and red cowboy hats, they are there to give you information and detailed maps."
Traditional korean houses,"Good scereney for photo shooting. It takes you less than 2 hours to check over bukchon. There are few more attraction such as ""korea palace"", insadong market and etc that you can explore over that idea. 5-10mins Walking distance from anguk subway station."
Must see,Lovely place. In the morning very quiet and hardly trafic. Don't skip this in your visit to Seoul it is really worth it. Friendly people (all over in Korea)
Good insight to old Seoul,"It is not prevalent to see so many old (600 year-old) buildings in one place. Especially with all the gentrification and rapid urban development going on, this is a rare gem situated in the heart of the city. It is like walking back in time. I'm glad they preserve these buildings to give an insight to the past. It is good for a relaxing stroll as there are signs urging visitors to keep their voices low as it is a real residential estate."
I would skip this.,We though we were going to visit an old village but we ended up looking at people's houses. It is an actual residential area where people decided to keep the traditional design..
Good way to see old stile Korean houses,"A very nice place and very convenient location, as it is walking distance from many other attractions.I would not call it ""a traditional village"" as the majority of the constructions are quite new... But following traditional architecture, nevertheless I can't imagine a visit to Seoul without stopping by this place.1 hour should be ok for a good walk around"
Traditional Korean Neighborhood,"Streets are really steep but you can have a look of another time as you walk through the streets and watch the traditional Korean Home Architecture, built of wood and with curved tiled roofs. In buckchon-ro-11 there is a traditional house that can be visited in a guided tour that cost about 10 dollars, but it is worth the visit and when you finish it they give you a cup of a really good prune tea and you can seat as long as you wish and watch the garden and verandas of the house and also the city scape."
A traditional village in the heart of Seoul,"Visit early in the morning around 9 a.m. before the hordes of tourists descend on this village. You can see the interesting architecture of the houses, especially the roofs and the doors/gates. There are museums within the village--some are for free. On the other side are small quaint stores."
Loved the area.,Traditional homes and structures. Quiet alleys. Like nothing else you've seen. We stayed there a could night. Loved it but our backs protested the sleeping on floor challenge. 
Nice for a quick walk,"Bukchon hanok village is a combination of old and new buildings, with some cute stores. There are also several little museums that are independently run, and lots of residential housing. There were good photo opportunities, but overall, it wasn't quite as charming as I'd hoped. I did like that it's still functional, though. Note that this involves a lot of walking, including up steep hills. It's not really handicapped accessible. There were fairly clear signs and also Seoul tour information people who could give directions and provide maps. Overall worth an hour's stroll."
Stroll around town,"This area has many traditional korean houses, and it is well organized with plenty of tourist offices and good maps with recommendations on the houses, views and businesses in the area. Get one before you head out."
Not too impressed,"Not really knowing what to expect, so ended up a little disappointed. It is interesting to see traditional houses mixed with modern buildings, though. Lots of coffee shops. İt's okay visit just to chill & unwind."
Bokchon Village,Loved looking at the traditional homes there. It was a very nice sunny day and we took a slow stroll through the village. I wished that we had more time to spend there because there were interesting stores and restaurants to explore.
Where is it?,"I felt like I spent endless hours looking for it. There were absolutely no signs, and I was shocked to see the number of other tourists who were similarly lost as I was, as the village is deemed a main point of interest in the city. That said, the neighborhood leading up to the village is charming enough that it makes up for it."
Traditional houses preserved in a modern city,"Perhaps it is because I have visited Insadong before coming to Bukchon, I did not find this area to be as interesting as anticipated. There were traditional houses everywhere and small shops along the street. The area is a lot less crowded than Myeongdong or Insandong. The hanoks are more authentic here, but it also means some need a bit more upkeep to remain beautiful. The streets could be a little steep, so you need to be careful. Also, since it's not a walking street all the time, there may be cars marching through the narrow streets. This is a nice place for a leisurely stroll and to soak in the atmosphere of a bygone era. :-)"
glimpse of past days,"very nice part of Seoul with pretty traditional houses (hanok). If You know Korean dramas (and like it) You can find house, which played in Personal Taste (where Gae-in lived)."
Very good for a walking tour,"Well documented, and very scenic. Reminds me of San Francisco, with a Korean spin to it. The houses, the landscape. Beautiful, and along the tour route there will be cheap (1000-2000W) exhibits to allow you to go deeper. If you stick to the suggested route - you start from the tourist center, and take a great walk back to Insadong area. You can even visit the palaces which flank the neighbourhood."
Historic and unique place,"The area preserved the traditional village setting. There are information guides wearing uniforms with hats with the letter I! These are steep hills so be prepared, better yet book a stay at a Hanoi locally and stay for an evening. Lots of restaurants, plenty of tourist shops, and there is a visitor center which can give you a map in English."
nice area around,it has a nice area around with a lot of small shops and cafes. each of them very unique. nice art work to buy
great,"maybe in the past it had to be a great place, it still keeps some of the old fashioned style. you'll enjoy walking around 1 hour for sure"
Beautiful neighborhood!,The neighborhood has home with old korean architecture. Stays open from 10 am to sunset. Nearby (betweem Bukchon and Seoul Museum of Modern Art) is a small market with quaint shops and eateries. Do have this place on your itinerary!
"Great place, worth a stroll around","Here the old style houses line the streets and it is a lovely stroll around this area to see them and how cool it is that they have been integrated into modern day Seoul. The buildings, carvings, decorations, dragons, architecture is amazing. The streets are so clean with boutique unique coffee shops, restaurants and clothing stores all over the place. Really enjoyed my walk around, and even went back another evening. Very convenient from the metro. Totally different from Seoul city centre."
Take a Little Stroll Back in Time,"Strolling the streets of the Bukchon Hanok Village is like stepping into Joseon Dynasty Korea for a while. The traditional houses are beautiful and kept in pristine condition considering their age.I suggest getting a map in your language since the streets felt a bit like a maze or labyrinth at times; although, there are so many people around, it would be nearly impossible to get lost. There are some really fantastic views of the city from this area as well; so, it makes for some perfect photo ops as well.Some of the hanoks have been turned into tea rooms, museums, and art galleries. This would be pretty much the only way you could view the interior of one of these historic homes; because the rest are still private residences.Go when the weather is fine and you have a few hours to stroll."
Must see,"A beautiful place where you can take some excellent photos and learn more about Korean culture. It's easy to reach by subway, there's a tourist center with information guides and maps in english."
"Hanok Village in Bukchon, a Lovely place to visit","We went to walk around in Bukchon and visited the Hanok Village on our very first day in Seoul, which was just walking distance from our bed and breakfast.We fell in love with this old village immediately even though the whole village only consists in a few blocks, we can easily trolling through all these little narrow streets admiring the very well kept Traditional homes, the colors and the designs of these home are so amazing, from walking around these streets in this village, sometimes we catch a glimpse of Namsang Seoul Tower, seeing the contrast between Old and New.Also don't forget to stop by and take a Tea break at Bukchon Best Prospect Tea Museum, they served very good tea even though the price is a little expensive, but it worths it. Tea and coffee's culture are huge in Korea."
Bukchon Hanok Village is where the present meets the past !,"I'm really impress with this place. Walking along this road, seems I were in Korean drama.At Gahoe-dong Alley, You can see the traditional Korean houses along with modern buildings and N Seoul Tower as the background. he traditional Korean houses are still inhabited by residents. You can catch a glimpse of residents' day-to-day life. The contrast of modern life and traditional building is the best point of this place, burglar alarms at the wall of traditional houses and modern cars.(People who live here must be great at driving because the alleys are so twisty. I think it is really amazing ! )You can enjoy nice and antique cafes and galleries alone the ways also. It takes a few hours to walk all areas but it's worth. "
Bukchon Hanok Village review,"The info desk had a nice map in English, that was helpful! The streets were a little confusing, but if you follow the other guests - you'll do fine. There are a few shops, restaurants, and guest houses on the way. It's a nice stroll. The only setback is the fact that you can't see inside the houses (at least when I was there - in the evening). Overall, it's a good afternoon activity. "
Excellent. To take pictures and have a date. ,"Excellent. To take pictures and have a date. Bukchon means nothern villiage. You can enjoy traditional houses, guest house, experience. Houses are real house where people lives. A little modernized. Never the less, from the hill you can see Jongro Tower and N Seoul Tour those are skyscrapers. Tradition house with modern back ground this is really good place. "
My favourite area in Seoul,"This is my favourite area in Seoul for the old feeling. From up the hill you can see both the old and the new (old hanok houses against the modern skyscrapers of the city in the backdrop). The area surrounding Bukchon is full of cute shops and boutiques. There is a hanok museum right at the top of the Buckchon village which is worth visiting to try the hanbok (the typical Korean costume) on: this requires a fee of 8000 won but when we went we were the only one there so we could take our time, take photos around the museum while wearing the hanbok and generally enjoy the experience without the crowds. If you have only time to visit one area in Seoul when in Korea then I would definitely recommend Bukchon. It is also close to two of the main palaces. "
OK but not as special as I thought it would be,"Don't really understand all the fuss. The buildings are not as old as they are advertised just built in traditional style. If you go now (August/September 2014) you can see a couple be built.If you are new to Asia and have not seen traditional style buildings then it is worth a visit. If you've been to Asia before and seen old buildings elsewhere, especially Japan, then I think it can be missed. Plenty of cafes and restaurants and some good touristy shopping.Near to several other sites (palaces) that can be done all together 1 one day."
It's worth the stroll,"Bukchom hanok village has the most number of traditional koren houses in seoul. Although filled with shops and cafes for tourists and locals, it is still worth strolling along its narrow streets. To see real traditional korean houses, go to narrow alleys. It is advisable to try one of the quaint cafes for a quick rest."
"Look, See, Enjoy","We stopped by the Bukchon tourist information center and pick up a map. There are 8 Buckhon scenic views in total. We went to no. 4 to no. 8. Of all the view, the best ones are no. 5 and no. 6. It's the uphill and downhill view of a street between row of hanok.It was nice walking along the street where actual people are staying but I gotta say the hanok are too modernized. If you love walks, then this is a good activity for you. Otherwise I find Jeonju Hanok Village in Jeonju has more to offer."
Extremely touristy and modernised,"It was a shame, there was a lot of modernisation to the buildings and it's surrounding area, clearly themed to target tourist and there is little to no access to the so called 'historic' sights."
Pity about the tourists,"Picking up a tourist map from the Bukchon Information Centre we spent a few enjoyable hours following the tourist trail and admiring the traditional architecture of Korea. The views from some of the high points are impressive, as are the picturesque, narrow lanes of the village.Whilst this residential area risks being overrun by us annoying tourists, judging by the number we passed and the 'please be quiet before 9am and after 6pm' signs, the village is well worth a visit. "
Nice scenery but nothing special,"Came here after reading reviews on internet about the village.Here's a few things you can probably do:1. Explore and admire the village + buildings2. Sit and drink @ various cafés/restaurants3. WalkIf you're in the area, you can just drop by. Otherwise, I feel it isn't worth the travelling."
Good for pictures.,There are people dedicated to help tourists that you could ask for directions and they'd also give you a free map.The place is hilly. You'd only see the facade or the roof of the traditional houses. Good for taking pictures. I found no other activity to do here.
Beautiful,"This is the old part of Seoul with the original houses that used to run through the city. It is a steep walk up to the top however it is beautiful when you look over Seoul from the top. Great picture opportunities also from here. You can get guided tours, however we just went to the tourist information centre and got a map. The lady in there was really helpful and pointed out the best places to go and have a look. Loads of little shops and places to eat round the area also. This is really near Gyonbokgong palace, so you could do both on the same day. "
its cool if you're in the area,"if you happen to be in the area, than check it out. the nearby temples are worthwhile, but to make a specific trip here, is not worthwhile. small area, not very large, and its just a small area which is a quaint ""hold"" street. there is also an old school library/education center nearby"
history of old style Korean house,"actually, lots of this area is private are which is owned by citizen. but the government opens for public as a tourist destination. so, they suggest you not to make noisy sounds. you can see the typical of old style Korean house. my friend who was my guide said that this area is quite expensive. so, all the house might have expensive price.don't forget to take a map at the tourist information, because they give a direction how to explore this place. only few place in the Bukchon that have free entrance. if you want to see inside the house, you have to pay 10.000 won. if you want see all around Bukchon from 3rd fl., you have to pay also (but i forgot how much is it). i've found nothing special in here, just to improve knowledge about the Korean tradition. Bukchon is very near to Gyeongbokgung. so, after visit Gyeongbokgung, try to walk to find Bukchon."
Super beautiful village,"Super beautiful, recommend you to take a walk during evening and sit somewhere near the observatory to chill. There is one famous local noodle shop - 手撕面 (in chinese), it costs about 7000 won for one set. It is super good. "
Historic place to visit,Great place to spend a few hours wandering the streets of Bukchon. Loved seeing the old traditional houses in Seoul. The area has guided maps along the way as well as Korean guides which speak a variety of languages which are very helpful (look for the people in the red vests - languages they speak are written on their back).
"Nice, but too crowded","It's actually a bit over-rated because the place is swarming with tourists, particularly the two main streets with the old hanok houses. Some of the teahouses are nice but overpriced. The walk through Samcheongdong and into Bukchon is nice though. "
Crowded but interesting,"We walked here from Changdeokgung Palace and looked for a place for lunch. Found a pizza place, very good. Then walked around the historic homes with the traditional tile roofs. Walked up hill and down hills. Could see Seoul Tower in the distance. There were stores for shopping also. Very picturesque."
Takes You Back in Time,Spend a few hours walking about the area taking in the traditional Hanok style houses. A few nice photo opportunities. There are quite a few museum/workshop type places where you can take part in making traditional crafts. I went to the Dong Lim Knot Workshop and made a necklace.
Not much to see.,Perhaps the taxi driver didn't take me to the best part but what I did see wasn't very impressive. Just saw a few buildings and a historic house museum which was nice.
Bukchon Hanok Village,Got here on a stroll from Insa-Dong down the road and behind the Constitutional CourtIts a quaint place and has some very well maintained (though recently renovated) old Korean houses.It was a Thursday evening and the roads were deserted and I enjoyed walking in the narrow alleyways between these houses - This maybe the only photo-op a short stay Seoul visitor may get of Old Style Seoul/Korea. There is a walking tour route available with a clearly marked path.
"Take your map, but then ignore it","This area of wandering narrow streets is filled with preserved older houses, many of them converted into small exhibits areas or so-called museums. It's fun to try to see how many of them you can find, based on the map distributed at information areas. It's just fun to wander, look in doorways, maybe stop at a museum or two. We saw the Gahoe Museum, Paper Doll Museum and Jewelry Museum. The latter has a somewhat high ticket price, but has a lovely collection. The views of Seoul over old tile rooftops are charming."
Beautiful little village inside the metropolis,"Quaint little houses and streets, somewhat akin to old Korea (although also somewhat touristy). Certainly worth going for."
For photography purposes,"Since you are in Korea, this is a must visit place for tourist. Quite a long walk to the main place from the station especially during the hot weather. Wear comfy shoes and clothes. Nice spots for photography but can get quite crowded since the paths are narrow. There are some cafes around if you're tired after a long walk but they could be more expensive than your lunch meal."
Old Seoul?,"I wonder if the old Seoul looked like this neighborhood. Anyway there are some nice spots inside but it is almost just a residential neighborhood, and it seems to be an expensive one."
Traditional Korean Village,"I just walked around Bukchon with the map in hand, which you can get from the tourist information centre nearby. It is a quiet residential area. The houses are all traditional korean style. one or two are kept open to tourists. There was a lady there who explained to me about the features of the house. There are lots of small pathways in the streets so it is easy to get lost inside. But people are very nice there and will guide you if you are also nice to them. Overall it was a nice experience."
Traditional houses,"Bukchon Hanok Village is really wonderful. Do not follow any guide or path: just walk around wherever you want and make sure to get to the highest point, so that you can get an incredible view of the whole area. PS: the area is a residential district, so keep quiet while visiting."
interesting,i didn't do the treasure hunt or get any souvenirs but just walked around and saw the houses there's a view from the top :) a unique place to visit 
Traditional houses at their finest,Bukchon Hanok Village is still a residential district- houses are well preserved and are still occupied by various generations. Head to Bukchon Information Centre to obtain a map of the walking trails and be prepared to climb steep slopes in return for a magnificent view of Seoul and Gyeongbukgung Palace 
Cute alleyways and some history,Bukchon Hanok Village is unique because it is mostly residential. It is a quiet and calm area which is definitely worth visiting if you're only staying in Seoul. If you have more time in Korea I would highly recommend the Jeonju Hanok Village which is much larger and more interesting (it has lots of cute cafes and boutiques too).Pick up a map from the tourist centre and do some exploring in Bukchon :)
"A throwback in time to peaceful, traditional Seoul","The visit to Bukchon was one of the more enjoyable aspects of my 5 day trip. If you are yearning for a respite from the city and all that shopping, it's worth visiting Bukchon.Recommended that you wear very comfortable walking shoes as there's lots of walking to do (think up hill and down hill as the roads are very steep), bring a bottle of water and a camera!The place is very scenic with lots of traditional Hanok houses/roofs!Did not spend much time walking around as it was summer and the sun was scorching hot! Took a rest at a cafe but would love to come back in the winter!"
Neat,"We went here looking for a specific restaurant, so we did not explore too much. It was hot and the place is hilly, but it's a unique neighborhood in a modernized city. Tourist information people hand out maps if you are hopelessly lost (which is easy to do) and it's imperative to keep quiet as it's a residential area, but it was a nice stroll."
Worth going,"Traditional Korean living district, recommend to walk there. Be ready for lots of ups and downs - the area is mountainous."
Calm peaceful old Seoul,"I enjoyed my visit to Bukchon. The walk around is peaceful and quiet. You get to see the old Korean houses and the view from the hills are beautiful. If you want a break from the city, this is the place to go. Would definitely love to go back!"
Old Famous Korean style housing area,Way too many tourists in living areas. Visited the area with much nostalgia where I used to live as a kid. Some buildings seem to be out of the way and it does not appear to maintain the traditional Korean housing style any more. Eye sore. But it is still great to see many houses maintain the old style and receive local residents and tourists.
Nice preservation,"Took some time to find the village. From the route that we took, we have to get up a flight of stone steps before locating the village.The traditional houses are very beautiful. Especially when you can find rows and rows of it. They had inhabited houses, so we took care not to make too much noise. A lot of the houses we found are unique and we took some great shots.However, the area is filled with tourists. If there had been less tourists, I think it would have been a more relaxed stroll in the village. "
Must Visit,"A laidback place that's still located in Seoul, you get to experience the past while not travelling too far. Do not forget to visit the observatory as well, since you can get to see the view of Bukchon from above."
Walking in Bukchon,"I walked by myself in Bukchon. You can book in for a free guided tour but I did not have the time to do this and i also thought it would be rather too long for me (about 3 hours). I walked up to the Tourist Centre and got a map of the area from them. I also told them my time frame and the girls at the centre advised me on the the best route. I only covered about half the area but it was a lovely, interesting walk, quite a lot up hill. I went into the open house which is run by the Museum. I wandered up and down the streets admiring the traditional houses and looked out over the city from the high spots. I would have loved to have done more but the day was very hot."
A look into the past!,This is one of the few places you can see what Korea looked like before she became an economic giant. Take time to wander through slowly before walking to Chandeogung Palace.
good to see Korean traditional house.,beautiful Korean traditional house. There are some traditional house to stay. 
Excellent day out,"This is one area not to be missed if you are in Seoul. A stroll through the streets of this lovely Korean village, with the traditional homes still being lived in, is an absolute treat for any traveler."
A traditiona Korean Neighborhood,We visited on a Saturday morning. Very interesting to see a traditional Korean upscale neighborhood that dates back centuries but still functions as a residential area. Worth the 1-2 hours to stroll
Interesting,It was interesting looking at the places where people lived. Want to try staying in a Bukchon the next time
one of my favourite places in Seoul,"I would highly recommend taking the time to see this areaThere is an info office on one of the main streets where you can pick up a map and an itinerary and it shows you around most of the area and gives an insight into the life of the villagers who lived there and worked for the palaces surrounding the area, its very interesting and awesome views from the top of the city"
A must,"But quite but not off the beaten track, still enjoyable. Gives a good picture of how the city used to be. "
All-purpose district,"The awesome part about Bukchon, is that it is alive and utilized in compliance with its purpose - as a residential district. Inhabited traditional houses are mixed with culture centers, shops and cafes, street vendors and even a school. the district is laid-back and bustling at the same time, and every corner worth sticking your nose into =)However, if you plan a visit, please note that tourists are kindly requested to keep reasonable hours (around 10 am to sunset)."
Nice place to walk around,"I went there on a Friday afternoon. I didn’t read up much on this place before I go so I was expecting it to be a fully developed tourist location. However, most of it is a local living neighborhood. It is nice to walk around this neighborhood slowly, as it got a lot of traditional houses and the view are stunning."
Beautiful place,"The houses and streets here are well kept and they are really beautiful. It is like going to a different city but it is located in Seoul. A place not to be missed!Get a map from the tourist center to help you go around the place easily, or ask the guides that are stationed there!"
beautiful!,In here you can see traditional houses of korea and some handicraft that they made.You can try walking around here while eating some ice flakes. Yum ~♥
"Beautiful, quaint historical neighbourhood","Make a turn off a busy street into this quaint neighbourhood with beautifully preserved traditional housing. There are still people living inside some of these houses while a few had been turned into galleries or shops, so there is a courtesy hour they ask people to observe (basically don't go there too early or too late). It's a steep walk with no facilities, but is worth it. If the weather is too warm or cold, get yourself a nice iced/hot coffee to-go from the little cafe right at the start of it to enjoy during your walk."
Traditional,"Nice afternoon spend doing arts and crafts with the locals. Kids enjoyed and had a taste of Korean crafts and culture including painting, bracelet making, jewellery box making. Time well spent!"
Traditional Korean village,This is a very accessible place to visit on foot. Delightful architecture and glimpses into inner courtyards with view of distant hills. September 2012 was a pleasant time to stroll there
Steep walk but well worth it!,"Put on some comfortable shoes and get ready for an uphill walk. You'll love the architecture, view and stretches of cafes! "
Hidden gem everywhere,Hanging around at bukchon could easily spend you a day or couple. It's a place with rich historical stories and places there are full of Japanese accents. Little handicraft shops at reason am price are also key attraction 
Traditional houses with the background of modern Seoul,"Bukchon traditional Village is a great walk even though you would have to walk uphill at most of the streets. You would be able to see the beautiful traditional Korean houses, if you walk uphill a little more, you will see the modern high rises. I really enjoyed this place and it do not take long time. and It is just walking distance from Insadong. Get the free map from the tourist office at the main street."
Great place to see Korean tradition and quaint cafes and shops!,"This area is definitely something travelers must go to when in Seoul. Not only can you see many examples of traditional Korean architecture with different streets lined by hanoks, but there are also various shops that focus on design along the nooks and crannies of the area. The streets from the hanok village towards Samcheongdong area are also lined with many different types of cafes and shops. There are also a lot of quirky street art, a feast for the eyes and photographers. It is a great place to stroll about, wind down, have a cup of tea, and maybe shop for eclectic items. We brought traditional Korean sweets from one shop, then a french baguette from a specialty bakery, took a break at a tea garden, gazed at the Blue House, and then window shopped at several of the boutiques in the area. "
Great experience,Bukchon really brings you back to the traditional old days and has a great vibe to the area. The hanok houses villages are beautiful. Great walk in the neughbourhood make sure you bring comfy shoes as there is a lot of uphill walking.Close by on samcheongdong road there are loads of cafés and shops which are certainly worth a visit
"Great walking, cafés and shops","This is a neat area, with an older feel, to walk around in. Just take a stroll, grab a meal and do a little shopping, including a nice chocolate shop! "
Quaint houses,A lovely place to visit after you have finished the palace. The houses are all built on slope and the uniqueness in the houses take you back to ancient history. Make sure you wear good walking shoes.! 
Pretty but very Touristy,We had a good time and I loved all the little houses in the Hanock Village. However there were people EVERYWHERE. Not sure if it is that busy every day but it made it feel much less like exploring and more like everyone was just shuffling through it together. Still got some good photos and saw some interesting things though! Would probably suggest going on a weekday not in the holidays if you can to avoid the crowds!
Beautiful Traditional Village,"Bukchon was great for shopping and eating, near the palaces and Insadong. Great place for traditional Korean food. "
Great for a walk back in time,"Fans of Heartstrings 넌 내게 반했어 (a.k.a You've Fallen For Me) by Jung Yong Hwa of C.N. Blue and Park Shin Hye, and Personal Taste 개인의 취향 by Lee Min-Ho and Son Ye-Jin will not be unfamiliar with the filming locations of the Korean dramas in Bukchon Hanok Village!Bukchon Hanok Village (북촌한옥마을/北村韩屋村) is home to hundreds of traditional houses called 'hanok' that date back to the Joseon Dynasty. Many of these traditional houses are currently used as cultural centres, teahouses and restaurants.Great for a leisurely walk. Photography lovers will enjoy the walk with the beautiful architecture. "
Seoul's traditional houses,Go here if you wanna see the country's traditional houses. You could easily stroll this place and it's for free. Take pictures everywhere!
Quaint Area,"It's worth spending an hour in the area to see the traditional Korean houses. Besides, you can also find some cute little shops that carry some unique stuff.Make sure you have comfortable shoes on when visiting there."
Quaint and traditional,"We made our way here from the Gyeongbokgung Palace and The national Folk Museum. It's not too far to walk at all. There are over 900 Korean traditional houses in this area. It is like a village frozen in time although the location is in the middle of the city. Although there are restaurants, cafes,art galleries, museums etc, it is still a residential area and there are many signs requesting to refrain from speaking loud. There were 2 tourist volunteers at the entrance to the area and we were given a map showing various routes to follow and specific areas marked on the map for great photo opportunities. It is definitely worth a visit."
come and see before commercialism takes over,"I would like to ask the world to come and see ""Northville"" before cheesy tacky commercialism takes over just like it did to Samchung and Insadong. Some people might argue it already happened, but i still believe there are independent spirits trying hard to not be swept away. This is a cool neighborhood. You dont get to see a lot of 80 year old houses in Seoul with growing kids and veggie garden. Its absolutely rare to see open sky. Young and creative artists showrooms and ateliers.Northville used to have it all but its changing. Come and see before its too late."
Picturesque korean village in Seoul,"Split by a main road into 2 parts, the western side is larger with uphill streets lined by old houses which make for nice photo shoots. Some houses hold art displays that are free to view while others collect entrance fees. Drop by the tourist info office for a map guide before you start exploring. One is along the main road 500m south of or before the entry roads to the village. The other is about 300 m up across the road opposite the 1st office. There are several cafés which serves as rest stops and to quench your thirst after the long routes."
Cute little part of town with nice cafés and stores,"I walked through Bukchon on the way from Gyeongbokgung Palace to Changdeokgung Palace. It is a charming area with cute little houses, cafés, bakeries and some really nice stores such as 'Object'."
A land back to the past,Get the feel and architecture glimpse of traditional Korea era by roaming the hallway & streets of Hanok. A village that gives you ease & an eye opening land to your heart. 
Take time out for a 'time capsule',"This has become one of the 'must do' sights in Seoul, and deservedly so. Translated as 'northern village', this well preserved time capsule of domestic architecture sits comfortably between two of the extensive northern palaces and is becoming increasingly popular, thanks to relatively recent publicity and promotion.As an architectural conservationist, I have a few issues with the commercialisation and sanitisation of parts, but am delighted that it is being maintained and integrated with the community.Allow a few hours; take your time and savour the all-to-rare historic environment, set against the backdrop of the expanding high-rise metropolis."
Excellent Place,"It was excellent place and residential place. Please keep silent during visit at there because it was is a residential neighborhood where people actually live. Bukchon Hanok Village is a Korean traditional village, those are staying with many yangbans (people from the ruling class). From there, we can visit a lot of different types of design. It was impressive. There are also a number of museums of traditional Korean culture including the Gahoe Museum, the Han Sangsu Embroidery Museum, the Museum of Korean Art and many more to get more information about hanok. "
Korea's Venice,I recommend that you have at least 2-3 hours set aside for Bukchon to meander through the streets. The Hanoks or Korean design houses are beautiful and they are found. In various corners. Meandering through the alley ways and the streets are the best way to just enjoy the architecture and the quiet neighbourhood. 
A leisurely stroll in an old-style neighborhood,"The traditional giwa tiled roofs of the traditional houses (Hanoks) make this area in Seoul quite uniquely interesting. Head to the Information Center near the Jeongdok Public Library to grab a tourist map and walk at a leisurely place around. Note that the Korean Tourism organized guided walking tours are no longer provided due to complaints from the residents about crowds and noise, so be quiet and respect the people that live in the area!"
Definetely my favourite spot in Seoul,"Bukchon is definitely my favorite spot in Seoul.. it is a great area with narrow winding street, I find my self lost in the time, wandering what life was a long time ago. Go there early in the morning when the place is still quiet - less tourist.If you are into traditional culture and heritage, love architecture and have soft feeling for old times - this is the place you need to visit in Seoul."
Find a Hanok to stay in,"What a great area – narrow winding streets, small cafés, art galleries, quirky little craft shops, and brave souls living like the Koreans of old in Hanoks. Sandwiched between the palaces to the east and west, and the narrow streets of Insadong to the south filled with bars and restaurants, Bukchon is a taste of Korea that you are not going to get staying in a large hotel tower.If you can't stay, go for a walk through the streets, try some soju at the cultural centre, or marvel at the restoration work underway on the houses."
Intimate walk,"This might just be my favorite place in Seoul. The first time, we dropped by the museum, which gave a good preview of a Hanok. It was early in the morning and most of the shops were still closed. So we had to visit it again during the day and it's nice to walk around and drop by the small boutique shops. It's good to know that regular people still live there although I also feel bad for them because there could be big groups of tourists walking pass by. "
Lovely Old Neighborhood,"Really nice hilly stroll through an older neighborhood in Seoul. I wish we could have gone into more of the homes. If you do go, you have to look carefully and research which ones are open to visitors. Make a point into going into a few. Really special experience!"
Quaint,"Quaint village... a little like you are walking through a movie setup for a period drama shoot.Go early before the crowd comes and you may get a good shot of the buildings, architecture and small lanes.We started on a small road immediately after the palace (this place is next to a famous palace but eh name escapes me at time of writing this review) - and this section are mostly residential.On the other side, there are lots of small shops and restaurants/food stalls.So, go for a visit, have lunch plus some window shopping/browsing.Overall, a lovely lovely visit and yes, I would recommend a visit to this place."
Keep your voice low,"The surrounding is nice and very suitable for photo shooting, having fun around, but too many people and hard to take a very nice scene. If lucky you may find some hidden view in the alley.  "
Worth seeing,"Great to see all the gorgeous hanok houses,had afternoon tea at one that has been turned into a cafe.Area has great atmosphere and some great fashion boutiques.Walked here after going to Changdeokgung Palace which is a 5 minute walk around the corner."
Just ok,The traditional houses are nice but i dont think the walk is worth the hike. I stopped midway through at a beautiful tea house and enjoyed a cup of ginger lemon tea and seoul views in autumn. I'd go again but just for the cuppa tea.
Mixture of past and present,Its very informative and you're faced with beautiful buildings from the past. Some are used as shops/ restaurants but others are residential areas. So we had to be quiet so as not to disturb them. I would advise you to wear comfy shoes because there will be lots of walking and hiking! 
Old n new co-exist side by side!,"use the subway: Line 3, Anguk Station, exit 2. Walk to the Tourist Info booth close by and pick up a map of the heritage walk. Well worth the 1-2 hour stroll, with a stop at one of the cute small cafes on the walk path. The one we went was adjacent to the Music Boxes store. Had a really small n cute outdoor seating in the courtyard surrounded by the cafe indoor seating. Had relics from the past, including a old horn type HMV gramaphone. You will see the various designs of traditional hanuk homes, with a smattering of places offering various types of workshops. Dont miss this!"
Beautiful and lots of walking,Memorable cultural walking trip! Lotsa photo taking opportunities! Traditional houses are very well maintained. Had breakfast at a traditional house and it was yummy! Can spend an entire day here!
Bukchon Village,You can get to experience and see traditional house here. Very nice place for people to visit and getting the feel of old traditional house. Their house are very well maintained and it's easy to get here via subway.
Beautiful traditional building but nothing special,"It's a nice stroll if you come with your partner, but there's really nothing special.Might be better and able to experience more if stay in one of the hanok hostel.There are some unique stores selling art and crafts, nice cafés, but all are pricey."
Heritage walk,"A must visit in seoul, where the traditional old quarter situated in the middle of modern glitzy seoul. A comfortable stroll next to the palace and Insadong area. Can easily spend about an hour or two. Has the lovely korean traditional houses. We'll preserved. If lucky can visit some inside and take a look. Has some lovely cafés and art galleries."
Interesting but nothing special,"May be nice for Korea; but doesn't compare to other historical districts in China or Japan. Very easy to find, just walk out of the subway and walk down the street. There is maps in the subway station. And the information desk provides maps to use for walking. I do like just walking around and plenty of nice shops and restaurants. Just not that special for historical district."
Different Seoul,"These streets and alleys takes you away from Seoul, like to an other city. Small roads and characteristic buildings are mainly well kept. There are several wonderful coffee shops, tea houses, restaurants and small shops. You must try one of those bakeries, just delicious. "
Interesting stroll,Interesting to see the mix of old (traditional houses) and new (latest model of cars). You walk up and down the hills to visit real people's residences. Get a map at the information center. The map points out 8 suggested spots in this area for good picture talking. We had a very nice lunch in this area and had a nice stroll in the neighborhood after meal. Follow the map and read the information provided. It is worth a visit.
Get lost in the atmosphere...,A great hike where tradition meets modernity. Gives you a glimpse into old Hanyang. Look out for the photo spots.
A nice stroll,This is a great neighborhood. Take your time and stroll through all of the little alleys. There are great views of the city from some areas. The roving tourist helpers are wonderful!
A must do in Seoul,"The access to go there is very easy by subway. Getting off at Anguk Station, Line 3, take exit 2, and you will find a tourist information booth where you can get a map. Without a map it is a bit confusing. This is an awesome place because it mixes the Korean traditional houses with the modern part of Seoul. What I like the most about this place it that it doesn't get crazy and super crowded like Gangnam, Hongdae, Itaewon... It's very different. There is a lot of cute places to eat (Western and Korean food) along with coffee shops, and a bunch of cute little stores where you can find from jewelry and clothes to handcrafts. I definitely recommend this place!!"
Not at all what I thought,"I saw a lot of beautiful photos of Bukchon Traditional Homes so I expected a lot. But I was a bit disappointed as not did we walk way far from the metro station, but it was a steep climb up as well to reach the actual houses. They were awesome yes, but you can only take photos outside. Map was a bit confusing to us and there were no helpful signs along the way."
Tradition Amidst Modernism,"This was a really interesting part of Seoul. We got a map at the information center which gives your observation points and places that have appeared in korean dramas. We loved the narrow alleys with beautiful traditional Korean houses neatly packed together. Do walk down the stair alley for experience! Alot of walking to be done here though, so wear your most comfortable shoes and bring your camera! Do also try the traditional tea tasting here.Another reason I loved exploring Bukchon was because there were many interesting buildings along the way, and many coffee shops! Waffle and coffee are a must try."
Awesome,This is really an interesting part of Seoul. Get a map from the information center and head north towards Bukchon. The left side part which is Hanok is much more interesting. We really enjoyed the twisting streets and the narrow alleys and of course the traditional houses with very low roofs. There is an observation point where one can have a magnificent view of the surrounding mountains and the Gyeongbokgung palace. Nice antique and art shops specially the one close to the main entrance to Hanok village (check the photo attached)
Korean Traditional Village,A nice place to take photographs but have to walk quite a bit from the nearest train station. It is a worth visiting place in Seoul as it is a place where visitors can embrace the beauty of traditional Korean houses.
view of the traditional and modern seoul,"we took the subway to go here so it was a bit of a walk but the tourist guides (with the letter ""i"" on their hat) can speak good english and can guide you on which part to visit. get the map from the information center before you start the tour. it will take you 4 hours to go around bukchon but if you only want to see the spots for nice for pictures, then there is a short cut (it is marked with red line on the map) and will take you about an hour to complete. go up a little bit further and there is a great view of the traditional houses and then at the back are the modern buildings of seoul. i think the place looks better with snow but unfortunately there is no more snow when I visited. there are several gift shops in the area plus cafes and restaurants. after completing your tour here, you can go straight to insadong which is just near the area."
Korean traditional house village,"There are many Korean traditional house village and Buckchon is the one in Seoul.If you are going to stay just in Seoul, I recommend you to stop by here, because traditional village in Seoul is just this one.And It's next to Gyungbock goong,(royal palace) so It will be easy for you to find it.But if you are staying in R.O.K more than 1 week, I think It will be better for you to go to the countryside just like Junjoo or Andong.There are many traditional villages there and those ones are much more better and in the countryside, there is a traditional show so you can enjoy the show."
Mix of traditional and modern houses,"A place that is good for evening walk and taking photographs. Not much to see here, only traditional/modern houses.Make sure you grab the map at Bukchon tourist information so you know how to explore it right. Bukchon is a big area, get lost among the alleys and enjoy the view! But if you go here during the winter, make sure you wear something to keep you warm. There're a lot of local restaurants nearby, make sure you try one of these ;)"
Great little shops in quaint village,"Be prepared to walk and if in winter, then dress very warm. A web of small streets with a variety of shops to browse in. When hungry, there are numerous cafés and restaurants to try. We had traditional Korean cuisine in a restaurant with no English name and hence will not be able to write a review on it. However it was hearty hot pot black sauce teibokki that was great on a zero degree day!We had amazing waffles in a Cafe Dal along Samcheongdong gil, an adjoining road."
perfection !!,the most beautiful place .... traditional places !! .... thats korea .... not just kpop and dramas .... this is the real south korea !
a mix of restoration levels,"This area has some lovely old houses. Unfortunately, not all are restored and they can be an eyesore. To see these houses, though, is well worth the walk."
Kinda disappointed,"There are 2 ways that you can get there:1) From Exit # 2 of Anguk Statio2) From Exit #5 of Gyeongbokgung Palace StationWe walked from Gyeongbokgung Palace Station, along the palace wall to samchengdong area. We saw a signboard ""Bukchon Hanok Village"", however after walking some slopes and around the area, we just could not find it. We saw a sign ""Tourist Information Center"", however, we could not find that too.We wanted to give up but we saw a long slope. We decided to just try and walk up. It is about 10-15 mins walk up a slope. Along the slope, on the left side, you can see the city. Then finally there is a turn! And we found the place! Luckily we persevere on! And we are lucky that we climbed that slope as the main photo street of Bukchon Hanok Village is a super super steep slope if you climb up from there. For us, we climb down from that street. Along that street, there are all the traditional houses. However, I was kinda disappointed as I was expecting more houses instead of only on this street. Anyway, just took several photos, walked around samchengdong and I left the place. Nothing much and you need to spend some time and effort climbing all the slopes... At least I don't feel worth going there."
A great place to stroll in Seoul,"This area has a mix of tradition mixed with modern amenities. There are so many museums, restaurants and quiet streets to visit. It's very photo friendly if you want to create great memories of Korea and it's connected with other major attractions. Please pick up a map from the tourist info booth before trying to explore on your own ... Bring a camera!"
Nice change from the Big City,We visited the home area and went to a tea house. This is a beautiful part for the city and very different from the big city feel.. Lots of great artistic shops. We purchased some needlework and pottery here
Fabulous Look at Days Past,"This neighborhood is a fascinating walk back into Old Korea. Of the many times I have been to Seoul, somehow I have missed this neighborhood. I had even been to both Palaces that border this slice of history and still had never heard of it. I took Metro Line 3 to the Anguk stop. Walking out of Gate 2, one block down the road I found a Tourist Information Center. The woman there spoke English very well and provided me with a map and verbal advice that was wonderfully helpful. I followed the recommended map route which worked very well for my intentions. The walking course took me along the nostalgic streets of this old neighborhood past many of the old houses (and a few reproductions) as well as several rustic alley ways. There were a lot of picture-worthy sites. Along the way, there were also a few boutique shops that kept with the theme of the neighborhood as well as small restaurants and coffee shops that looked inviting. It was fascinating to see this place. It truly was a walk back in time. For those who have the time, there were also several activities and a couple of museums/galleries that were available. I would definitely recommend planning to at least stroll through this area. Before you do so, stop by the tourist information center to get an orientation."
Old Seoul,"Bukchon is gorgeous and very atmospheric. Weekdays are uncrowded, and it's possible to go inside some of the old houses - some for free. I really recommend a walk around."
a journey to the old Korea,"while other corner of Seoul is hype and crowded, full of cafe and make up store and fashion, this corner is very silent and the house are still well kept in Korean traditional houses. this village is still so pure and people still living inside the house so be aware to not just enter and photograph, since there is some rules for photographing people in Korea please ask permit when you want to photograph them in their house. the houses is all private and some houses offering courses on Korean traditional drink 'soju' making, knotting, painting etc. the great thing is we can go to observatory, its on the hill part of Bukchon and held by old lady, from 3rd floor we can better view this whole village with palace on the background.the place offer green tea and coffee, in winter this is the warming station after freezing discovering korean tradition. :)"
Explore Bukchon and learn more about Korea,This old village is a must visit. In here you will see not just the shoot locations of your favorite K-drama but also the old and traditional Korean houses. The architecture and designs of these old houses is a preview of the Korean culture. You should not miss it. 
Very sweet and pretty,"This area is full of little nice but surprising museums : chicken museum, embroidery museum, amulets museum. We even got the unplanned opportunity to learn how to paint on wood and get a tea ceremony. So don't hesitate to try some of those little museums , you never know what awaits you inside !"
semi-modernised with rustic charm,"Outside Anguk subway station and around a corner, Bukchon has many of the traditional Hanok still standing.We went on a snowy day where the flurries added a sweet icing to the cake, perfect for photos."
Nice place to walk and see the architecture,We combined this with a walk around Insadong and then back to our hotel - The Metro Hotel. It's a lovely place to take pictures.
Take a chance..,..to see Korean traditional homes in the heart of Seoul. Nice small shops with handicrafts are nice and lovely.
Must see,Explore the romantic walks on a quiet weekend and have some hot tea in their quaint cafes. Lots of galleries are open to the artsy fartsy set.
"Take the time to view these typical hanok, traditional Korean houses.","Yesterday was frigid but we made our way up the hill and what a delight it was to view these lovely old,and or reconstructed homes is the old fashion. Most have been turned into restaurants, coffee shops or shops with varying merchandise, much of it quite ethnic and interesting looking. We were cold enough that we were finally driven into a coffee roasters where we had a divine and warming mocha latte. We took any number of photos of some of the more interesting ""homes"" but as darkness set in we decided that we should head back to the station. On our way downhill, we sopped to watch a gal half seated, half lying on the ground, who was heating a pot of sugar over an open flame (probably about 5 minutes) until she could pour this carmel colored ""batter"" onto a baking sheet where she folded it in half, cut it into 3 equal pieces, flattened each piece with a spatula, and then impressed each with a different imprint. She was selling them for 1 won each and you'd have thought she was giving away diamonds - basically just burned sugar but warm and wonderful - a sight we've not encountered before. Give it s try if you see it."
worth visiting!,"My parents, 76 and 70 years old and my self visited this village as I searched from online that its very near the place we were staying from Somerset Hotel, so with the guidance of the map and very helpful Souls of Seoul we tried to visit this village. Albeit cause the Osteoarthrtis of my father to act up, we soldiered on. We saw the famous street and its really beautiful, worth to take a photo as a memento. We chance upon one Hanok house that you need to pay 10 dollars as entrance fee, with the history of the house, guided tour and free delicious plum tea and you can stay as long as you like.if you can spare some cash , go and vist it, its worth it. You can see from the balcony the thatched roofs of the other Hanok houses, although some are residentials and people really are living there so need to be respectful of their privacy. But there are some Hanoks that can be visited just like we did and i say its worth the orice.There's a lot of interesting cafes, restaurants, stores you can broswe upon and I might say the people are very friendly.One can identify some locations from the dramas if you are a Korean drama fan."
A must see when visiting Seoul,"This place is indeed a surprise. My friend was leading us to this place, saying its like a Korea cultural village. It was much more than expected. So many amazing architectures, we could not stop taking photos. Also, there are many arts and crafts lessons if you wish to partake in. My only regret was that we were there at about 2pm and most of the places close by 5pm, otherwise we could have explored more."
Emerged in traditional Korean living!,Beautiful traditional Korean houses. It's a real residential area so gotta keep your voice low... Go there for sunset! It's definitely worth the visit.
Nice little neighbourhood,Very authentical residential area. It gives a good impression of local customs as well. there are maps available to guide you through the villlage
Authentic hanok village,"Went to Bukchon in the afternoon after heading to Gyeongbokgung. Walkable distance from gyeongbokgung and tosok ginseng chicken, would be good to take a day tour around the area. There are many tourist information centres at different spots to ask questions and get maps. There are also walking information guides dressed to red who can help to give directions around. Some of the museums provide demostrations on korean culture but comes with admission fee.Overall, a nice place to experience korea culture and see the hanok architecture."
很漂亮的景點,如果你愛看漂亮的建築，如果你酷愛拍攝。。你超愛這里。。and there have very sweet shopping area uphill from 安國地鐵站，it's a bit like 自由之丘in Tokyo....all the shops are very cute....
Worth a visit,Worth going to see the unique village and the houses. Just be aware it's basically uphill the whole way so not an easy walk. Easy to get to from the subway station and a short walk from Insadong shopping area.
Lovely area of Korean houses,"The site itself was a bit far from the train station so my mother (being a senior citizen) had a bit of a hard time walking. I had to ask for directions from a tourist stall we came across. Upon arriving at the ""village"", it was nice to take photos in front of the Korean houses. Lovely cultural place. The day we visited though, there were a lot of police due to a demonstration so it was kind of unnerving to be walking with all of them around."
Great picture taking area.,"This is a real village that people live in. And it looks straight out of the old Korean dramas! There are free maps of the roads, and there are many little homes that offer you to make a Korean craft (paid). Or you can walk around and just take pictures. Also there is an artsy hipster like area where there are art, hand-craft items shops and little coffee shops. Very cute. What's also nice is that there are about 9 picture spots that are truely nice."
village,"Great houses there, very culturalI really wish to be there again, sooner or later maybeTake the pictures front of the houses"
Neat little place,"I enjoyed thus little area, quaint shops. It was snowing, and cold but places for a coffee along the way. Enjoyable atmosphere. Not an earth shattering have to do, but fun."
Heritage houses with Mod Cons,Basically new or refurbished homes and streets set to look old but clearly for the wealthy in Seoul. Not so great but the odd original house is worth a look. 
Nice walk,This is really not much more than a pleasant walk. Make sure you get a local map from the local tourist guides - you can't miss them dressed in all red.
Historic & cultural Seoul,"Great place to know more about historic and cultural Seoul. An enjoyable walking tour through alleys and slopes, passing by traditional Korean houses, handicraft shops and residential areas. A very unique place to explore apart from the highly satisfying shopping trips in Seoul. Get a map from the tourist centre, follow the trail and look out for the ""photo taking"" spots. Don't miss these spots as they are really places to take breathtaking pictures. Immerse in the charms of Samcheongdong while taking your walk to Isadong. Experience the serenity, comfort and character in this area. A nice change from the bustling Myeongdong and huge shopping malls in Dongdaemum."
Getting Acquainted with Seoul,"This is actually one of those heritage places that even though goes on with their usual lives, also allows the tourists to have a peak at their culture. The whole Bukchon is spread over steep and narrow alleys that have traditional Korean houses aligned along its line and along with these houses; you also get to see lot of handicraft shops and restaurants that serve authentic Korean cuisines. The walking tour is actually the best way to see seoul in its day to day life and you could interact with the natives to learn about their culture and lifestyles. The walking tour actually comes with proper instructions and guidelines so that you do not get lost around here. The place being an active residential area requires one to be in their best behavior so as to not meddle with the daily chores of the people living around here. The whole place is very quiet and serene and has lots of attractive and impressive view."
Historic Seoul traditional houses,Like this place but try to go there in the afternoon to avoid group tours in the morning. There are areas where you can take a photo with n Seoul tower on the background. It's also near chungang high school famous place where winter sonata was shoot!!!
Nice old village,"To get there, you need to get the subway to Anguk and follow exit for the village, once out keep walking straight and you can't miss the masses the tourists. The place itself is beautiful and have breath taking views. It was a nice change from the hustle and bustle of Myeongdong and there are several street food places jotted around the outskirts if the village, wifey would recommend the pasty that looks like a fish on the outside and red bean on the inside!"
Walk up the hill,"Walk up the hill to get away from the biggest crowds, and slowly take in the beautiful homes up here. Some are old, some are new, and some are new but made to looks historic. Virtually without exception, all are a feast for the eyes, with terracing and architectural flourishes that demonstrate an understated Korean luxurious life."
Nice change from the usual shopping activities.,"Interesting old buildings but also many newer buildings that was constructed to replicate the old buildings charms. Too many shops and restaurants for my liking,"
Nice Place!,"We did not spend much time here but I did manage to walk around the alleys and take lots of pictures of the old Korean styled houses. Perhaps it was due to the weather, extremely cold. The houses were very pretty and with the recent snow fall. Art and craft shops to visit!"
Okay,"Perhaps it was due to the weather, extremely cold.The houses were very pretty and with the recent snow fall. Art and craft shops should also be visited and experienced. Shopping is also interesting and actually slightly cheaper than Seoul with good quality too!"
Prepare for a good walk!,"There are 8 spot for tourist to take photo within Bukchon, to complete the whole circle will take more than 1.5 hour walk (around 2.5km).Can reach there by subway @ Anguk Station, exit 3 and you could start the search of the spot follow the route shown in the tourist map (map could be obtain at Bukchon Cultural Center neat to Anguk Station exit 3). In my personal opinion, some of the spot could be omitted and Spot 1 & 5 got the most photogenic spot.Get ready for a good walk as some of the route are very steep."
traditional style buildings and a lot of walk,I would recommend to get the map from tourist center before start your walking trip in Bukchon. And pls be quiet!
"Interesting, but retail-ful as well ...",A different feel from the usual shopping areas in Seoul as this area comprises of older architecture. Good to venture beyond the shops along the roads to see the homes on the steep hillside. Enjoyable cafes here too.
"A lot of ""new traditional"" hanoks, but beautiful","I had a free guided tour all to myself, so it was quite nice, it gives you an idea of what real hanoks looked like however, most of them were reactualised,and there is also many museums abs things to see in the area. Wear good shoes as you're there for a walk! Although it was a rainy day I enjoyed the walk and sights"
Tradisional house,make sure you didn't make a noise when entering this beautiful housing area. These tradisional house is very beautiful to feast by your eyes.Love it 
Wear good walking shoes,"It was a cold day when we took a walk in the Bukchon Hanok 'village', where there are many rebuilt houses in the traditional style. Go prepared with good walking shoes so that you can enjoy the stroll. There are ample opportunities to snack and enjoy hot drinks. Thankfully the residents do not seem to mind us tourist taking photos outside their houses and along the streets."
Latent xenophobia,"Tourists who look like ethnic Chinese should be wary when walking along the narrow roads and taking photos. Some of the resident simply hate Chinese tourists and will abuse you and force you to delete the photos they claim should not be taken as Bukchon is not a public area. That was the experience of our group of 10 people on November 25, 2013. A woman from one of the residences with a dress tag describing her as a ""staff"" abused our group, snatched a camera to delete photos taken and screamed ""we do not welcome Chinese to Korea. We hate Chinese!"" We tried to complain to the ""Information"" people in maroon to no avail. The police were not helpful either, language was a huge problem. We are writing to the Korean ambassador to lodge our complaint."
Well preserved history,We did not spend much time here but I did manage to walk around the alleys and take lots of pictures of the old Korean styled houses. It is nice to find history so well preserved here and there are lots of small restaurants in the periphery if you want to grab something to eat whilst walking around. I was told by the lady at the information office that the areas marked 5 and 6 on the map that they handed out was the most picturesque. 
worth-walking,"korean traditional houses right in the heart of busy seoul? surely you don't want to miss it! i think it's one of the best site in seoul. it's very near from changdeokgung palace, and you'll still have times to explore other sites nearby. i really love the architecture of the houses, but please be silent, for people are living in those beautiful houses. there was a backyard in a house with adorable exterior. i'm not quite sure what place it was, weather it was a cafe or just a backyard, but it was really-really charming. my advice: be prepared to hike the hilly pavement, and prepare your camera batery full."
Experience Yi Dynasty era,"This is a neighborhood near the 2 palaces (Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung) where sometimes houses of nobleman existed during Yi Dynasty. A lot of the traditional houses have been converted, but half or so houses still keep the traditional old flavor (and now they are unable to take them down and build modern structures). This is an area where you can experience staying in Hanok (Korean traditional houses with warm floors - Ondol), and over the years, many living national treasures have started to congregate to promote the traditional crafts and traditions. Few examples of such are: traditional artisan Soju maker, knot maker, embroidery, etc. It has become extremely easy to see this area as starting few years back, a detailed map can be obtained from tourist kiosk and follow the path."
Village with traditional Korean houses,"I visited this place on last Sunday and it was very nice. If you want to see traditional Korean houses - Bukchon village is the best place. To go there you can take subway. Get down at anguk station. Form anguk station, it is at walk-able distance of 5-10 mints. For more clear directions you can also take help of help-desk near anguk stationThings to see here : - traditional Korean houses and roads.- In few place you will see some workshops for different activities. You can also enjoy over here.- There are few shops which sells some traditional things of Korea like ornaments.Overall place is very good for one time visit."
Korean village,"This is a place where someone should not miss if you want to feel like coming to korea. When we venture along the village streets, we could enjoy the Korean traditional houses closely. Streets are clean and quiet and we enjoy the serenity."
An adventure into history with a modern twist,"Read ten things one must do when i am in korea!!! So went with low expectation with tourist trap mindset. But what a lovely surprise. I loved the small shops, and restaurants, loved the tourist shops, and loved that every corner was a surprise. I walked for hours and had a most wonderful time. The shops were so amazing and shop keepers friendly. I would really recoomend this for all who travel to seoul."
A little disappointed,"Although it did make for a good walk around to explore, I always all that amazed by the hanoks themselves. Lots were new, and some were still being constructed. I didn't feel very much like I was ""back in history"" like many others claim. Different experience for everyone I guess, just not a great one for me."
A step back in time ,A great walk around the streets of old Seoul. It's free and you can really see and feel the history here. A must for you Seoul trip
Interesting flavour of old Seoul,Worth an hours walk after seeing one/some of the nearby temples. Gives a sense of what Seoul must have been like before the concrete took over. Lots of small guest houses for the more traditional stays. Small restaurants selling a lot of cheap traditional korean food....
cute town with lots to see!,it's a dynamic neighborhood with lots to see - with shops and people from around the globe in the most traditional Korean atmosphere
Nice architecture and narrow streets,"I went to Hanok village with my mother in early November. The old houses are very well maintained as there are people staying in them. It was nice to walk through the narrow streets although there were cars parked along it. Although the roads were quite steep, my mother still enjoyed it. Actually what I liked most was shopping around the area near hanok village. There were many eateries and shops which were busy and it was fun walking around. It's easy to get to - take the subway and drop off at Anguk station, exit 2. Walk for 300m straight and you will be there. I went there after strolling around Insadong street which is a slightly long but manageable walk from Hanok Village."
"Walking, walking, walking","It's a nice neighborhood to go around and take pictures in, but that's kind of it. We went on a Sunday morning, so it was..sleepier than usual, I think. Be prepared for a lot of walking. We got tired pretty quickly. Luckily, there are a bunch of small restaurants in the area. "
Traditional village in a middle of bustling metropolitan,"I thought I was going to have a photographic feast in Bukchon Hanok. The houses were nice but to me, the whole area was nothing special. Only get a few nice shots because there were so many tourists flocked the houses. If you are planning to come here, you can start your walk from Insadong area, then make a stop at Ssamsigil (they have plenty of cute knick-knacks for your family back home), then continue your walk a little bit to Bukchon Hanok. There are plenty of tourist guides along the area just in case you need some directions."
Bukchon guest house,We were able to check out one of the guest houses in this area. Very cute area. would love to try out the guest house the next time we visit Seoul.
Traditional village,Nice place to feel the past while being in the future. House are very nice and very authentic. Please respect that people are really leaving in these houses.
Traditional Village,Enjoyed walking through Bukchon. The houses are traditional and historical but are occupied and updated in terms of front and garage doors. Would love to see inside the homes. Walked past one where the owner was installing an outdoor light fixture and could see the modern conveniences through the open gate (yes; I was looking). Fantastic view at the top of the street. Stand on top of the cement clock/cornerstone at dusk. Beautiful! Loved the character and feel of the neighborhood. Worth a look!
Love this place!,"Walking through Bukchon is a very refreshing experience. You get an eclectic mix of shops, and there are also many small boutiques and boutique hotels there. There are also coffee places and tea houses for you to get a cuppa to soak in the atmosphere. All this makes a walk through Bukchon a different experience from other parts of the city.From Bukchon, you can also get a panoramic view of Changdeokgung, and there are many arts and crafts shops there too. Go to the tourist information at Changdeokgung to get a walking map of Bukchon."
Feel of old Korea,"Well not much feel of old Korea as when we were there, there are a lot of renovations going on there. Some of the old house you can sees it has preserve the old construction but using modern material. Example the main door entrance of the houses are using digital code lock but the door was old wooden style. :)For photography, this is a good background view of village buildings. We took a lot of picture here. Great things here was the Korea tourism guide are standing around the corner if you need any assistance. They will point you where to take the nice picture as per their map or flyer."
flash back to the old korea,"this area are full with traditional korea house""hanok"". my korean friend told me that all the villagers in this places were rich family who worked with goverment or have relation with the king in ancient year. this village is now recommended by unesco, hence some of the villager had to rent their house to be restaurant or to be various museums.some of the shops such as the rice cake (toppokki) shop in front of Doo Guest House has been operated for at least 35years by using the traditional style to cook the rice cake.i love this village and i stayed at the hanok house in this village for four days. the best way to explore the village is to have morning walk around the village and walk into the museum to experience the culture and traditional of korea."
First impression of hanok (traditional houses),"If you don't have the opportunity to see the traditional houses (hanok) in Jeonju or in one of the folk villages, you should not miss Bukchon. There you can see these lovely old houses - and it's not a museum because people actually live there."
Locals area,"Bukchon Is an alley, where you can find the Hanok village, its not the real village but a re creation of what their traditionbal house looks like. I like the alley, where there are locals shopping for Korean made trinkets, there are also restaurants there that offer affordable meals"
I fell in love immediately!,This is as authentic Korean village and entire experience was delightful!We lunched at a tiny family owned cafe...The language barrier was overcome by the welcoming warmth of the owners! The homes are lovely and the overall feeling was simply awesome! 
Beautiful houses but not a tourist destination,"This area has some lovely looking houses in the traditional Korean style. The area is not hard to get to from Insadong.However, it isn't really designed to be a tourist destination. These are people's houses. They live in them. There are signs asking the tourists to stay quiet (though they are not that effective). People living there try to drive to their house and tourists are blocking the way.There are few signs so it is a bit challenging to find the best streets of houses though there are often people in red shirts directing the tourists where to go.It was an alright visit but I felt quite awkward being in a residential area."
"600 years history, convenient to access by subway","Nice place not only it shows you 600 years history of Seoul in Bukchon, but also many nice shops established in the neighborhood. They sell hand made products. And there are some gallery and some art works placing on the street when you walk around Bukchon. The tourism develops not bad with well maintainance of Bukchon old style and the special landscape. Worth to have a day trip or a stay at traditional guesthouse at the area."
peace at mind,"Had an amazing time wandering the alleyways of Bukchon and peeking into various shops. Samchongdong street has an overabundance of 'super cute' coffee shops, but the Sujebi restaurant with a long of Koreans waiting to get in as if it was a meatpacking club is a gem - they serve traditional handmade noodles."
A glimpse of Korean history and culture.,"I arranged for a free goodwill guide for this Bukchon Hanok tour and we're so glad we did. The guide, Mr. Park educated us with the culture and history of Korea before we headed to the village. It is located in a hill which makes it even difficult to walk. I am so amazed that they were able to preserve the original structures of the hanoks built centuries ago. There are homestays to better feel what its like living in the past. "
When ancient meets modernism,"Wander around, get lost in the small streets, get into all the houses. Have coffee, tea, take your time. Discover Korean arts, Korean food. Experience Seoul away from the concrete jungle."
Uphill walk,Was so tired after climbing the stone steps all the way to the top but you will see very interesting Hanok guest house. More picture taking!
Like the Hutong area of Beijing,"Bukchon Hanok village is a sampling of ancient Seoul. Famous artisans and well connected families supporting the palaces used to live here. The area is near Gyeongbok Palace, Changdeok Palace and the Jongmyo Royal Shrine. I spent an entire day walking between these three places since I like to hike. It's possible to see women in traditional Korean wedding dresses using these street corners for photo opps on weekends. Steep hills and a few cobblestone roads make running or hiking shoes with ankle support a wise choice for touring these places."
Bukchon Hanok Village,Bukchon Village is an interesting place to explore and you can find many traditional Hanok over there. Good for taking pictures!I had written a blog on Bukchon Hanok Village you can read it at http://loveanqila.blogspot.sg/2013/09/travelogue-bukchon-hanok-village.html or www.loveanqila.blogspot.com under the travelogue tab.
Roofs,An active neighborhood of traditional architecture. The view down from the hill looking at the rooftops of the old buildings is interesting. It was easy to get to with the subway. 
A walk through the historical footpath,"I loved this place! However, due to the wet weather, we only managed to spend half a day walking around the alleys and admiring the hanoks. For people who plan to visit, please respect that this is still an active residential areas hence please control your excitement and keep your volume down. "
Amazing place to experience a bit of Korean,"This place is very organized. There is a small information center before the walk starts. Just ask around where the information center is. They will give you a map and then you can follow the map to walk around all the typical Korean streets in the area. It can be quite hot if you go in summer time, however there are coffee shops you can stop, which makes is very enjoyable."
Probably the most beautiful place of Seoul,Walking though this typical old style streets you can feel the real hearth of Seul. Lovely shops and cafè make the atmosphere more enjoyable. You can find typical korean handicrafts (I have to say not very much..). Easy to reach using the Line 1 of the Metro. There are also some guesthouses.
Stretch of traditional Korean Houses,"The stretch of traditional Korean houses were very appealing to the eyes and for picture taking as well as the elaborate design of the houses were fascinating. Houses were located at the hilly side so it is quite steep going up and down. There were like two areas where you can see the stretch of said houses. Others traditional houses were mixed with the new ones in the area hence were not exclusively traditional houses in one location or village.The place has many restaurants, coffee shops, convenience stores. What is so great about visiting this place is that Korean Information (personnel who assists tourist locating the areas) was available in the area.Recommending this as a must see for first timers."
A wonderful walk,Bukchon is an area where we can enjoy artwork. Also we can have a walk in the ancient wall. We can know something about ancient Seoul. But be sure to bring your passports as you have to register for safety procedure.
Now this is Korea!,"Whatever you do, please take time to walk around this area. You will not regret it! The most lovely Korean homes on multiple streets! There are staff from Korea tourism walking around to point you in the right direction should you have difficulty finding anything!"
Please tiptoe quietly,Homes of Nobility and High ranked government officials in the Joseon Dynasty period. Historically significant. Homes had intricate details. Just lovely. Twenty minutes is all you need. Good shoes needed for steep walk. People live in this neighborhood today. We didn't feel good imposing on their privacy.
Nice quaint village,"Nice place to shop, cool cafes and nice restaurants. Some of the restaurants are private kitchens with limited menu selection but food is delicious and comforting, very home-made feel."
Lovely......,"We stayed in a Hanok when we spent a week in Seoul & enjoyed every second of it. So needless to say this was not top of our list of things to do because we had already spent time staying in one. On our last day staying in Seoul we decided to check Bukchon out & Im glad we did. This place really is beautiful & special. If you get to understand Korean history & culture just a bit you will understand why this is special as well. My favorite spot was the street where you can see the N. Seoul Tower, it was a moment & view I will never forget spent with my husband & 2 children. & just for the record ANYWHERE you go in Korea in the summer, especially outside touristy stuff in Seoul, you are going to be HOT! Why do you think everyone carries fans everywhere?!?! ITS HOT! So get yourself a good fan & an umbrella & enjoy all of the beauty that is Korea! :~}"
Quite Disappointed,We saw pictures online of the place with a lot of traditional houses and activities happening. We went during Summer in Korea and Summer is extremely hot and humid. Had to walk about 300M from the subway and up and extremely steep slope to the Bukchon Village. Nothing much to see except beautiful traditional houses but that is about it. Great place to take some pictures but if you're there in the summer i'd say it isn't worth to travel all the way. 
the 'old town',"this old area of seoul is full of traditional style houses, that have been well preserved and maintained. it seems that any renovation or upgrade work is strictly controlled to maintain the look and feel of the area, which is great. it is definitely worth spending some time walking through the narrow streets and soaking up the atmosphere."
Pretty cool,"The name ""traditional Korean village"" had me imagining a model village for tourists to see what traditional style Korean houses look like. However, upon arriving at Bukchon, it turned out to be a neighbourhood that happen to have a lot of traditional style Korean houses with real, live, living inhabitants in them. There are signs along the narrow roads asking tourists to keep their voices down and no photos inside the residences out of respect the the privacy of the owners. A couple of the houses actually will give you a guided tour of the interior at a fee. We didn't do that, so just walked along the lanes and looked a the houses from the exterior. The neighbourhood is on a hillside and so a lot of places it's quite steep. You do get a good view at certain points though and there are some cute shops, cafes, and restaurants tucked in unexpected places. We happen upon a little cafe that was so cute. The shops etc. are not in the same area as the traditional houses though. We wandered beyond them but I couldn't say exactly in which direction. We ended up down by the main streets and close to Gyeongbokgung Palace. The houses were pretty from the outside but I don't know if it alone was worth the trek. The view down below and the nice walk was good though."
Peaceful...,"Have to say that I love this place! I love wandering around the village. There are many restaurants, cafes, shops and private houses but all are in traditional style. Verybeautiful. I also love the atmostphere here, quiet and peaceful. I visited many famous places in Seoul, but all other places are busy and noisy. Come to Seoul everybody should visit this place. But don't forget the map in case you get lost!"
Forget the map,"A quaint little, well maintained village behind the gyeongbokgung palace. My suggestion? Once you are done with visiting the sights one has ticked in this village, just close the map and walk around the streets with the aim of getting to Samcheong Park. The walk itself will be worth it and once you get to Samcheong park, do the trail which leads to the wall and view Seoul from the top of a hill."
Ancient in Modern,The old but renovated building is attractive. Walking at a place which come out in the drama make me feel slightly excited.
Nice ancient architecture,"If you like ancient architecture and buildings, you will enjoy the Bukchon Hanok Village. Don't except too much as you can only admire from the outside and not the inside as it is the actual residential area. There are also signs for you not to disturb the resident. Fair enough. Still nice to go and have a look, but I wouldn't say it is a must go. "
Interesting experinece...,"You will find many traditional homes and guest houses here. My favorite was a cafe with the hours of operation listing ""9 am - whenever"". I come from a city where things shut down at 6pm for the most part and most people go home after work. Too see shops like this was a treat along with the historical backdrop."
The beauty of winter with traditional roofs covered by snow,"I can say this place is one of the must-visit spots in Seoul. Specially in winter of Seoul, try to visit after snowing even though it can be freezingly cold. The village is on a hill so the view of Seoul from there is wonderful,,,you can feel the unusual mixture of standing in the middle of the traditional village with a view of modern buildings ahead."
Trad houses,good walk with volunteers in red speaking both Mandarin and English to guide you if you are lost.Policemen are very polite and courteous.
Best place for a relaxing afternoon,"Walk down the streets, have a coffee and waffle ( the one I recommend will be C I- 2 Cafe ) the waffle with green tea ice cream is great ! Visit the art gallery and check out the local designers accessories. I can spent a full day here and not feel bored. It is a must see place in Seoul.I cannot describe the feeling. Walking along the street you see a mix of building of old and new. The overseas chain of coffee as well as the local chain. Of course the local chain of coffee wins the market share. It is suitable place for families, couples and for singles and friends who want shopping , window or buying, gather for chit chat and have a slow afternoon."
Must See,"The highlight of my trip this July! The Bukchon is a cluster of traditional Korean houses, small shops and musuems. Try to avoid Mondays as most museums are closed and even the Tourist Information office is closed! If you see young people in RED T-shirts standing in a street junction, they are in fact mobile TI and they will point you to the right directions They spoke good English and Mandarin too. Do ask for directions as signage is not adequate in the area and you will easily miss a turn and you will never find the traditional houses."
Traditional private hanok houses near central Seoul,"Interesting to have a wander through this hillside area. The houses are mostly private homes and the locals do not want to be bothered by intrusive tourists. Clusters of houses converted to restaurants and cafes, and some interesting little cottage museums, like the Embroidery Museum. "
Like walking thru history of Seoul,"Its a traditional village architecture in the middle of seoul. Interesting architecture & good for great picture. Walking thru the place makes me feel like walking thru the old days of Korea. Its not easy to take great nice picture due to the people walking thru the alley. You need to walk up the hill thru the alley with 3 kids. Tiring but its worth it. There're some shops, cafe's at the end of the alley where you can clear the thirst. We found 2 tourism representative where you can get pamphlet & info's with regards to the place."
Nothing special,"Village with some restaurants, small shops, and private homes built in a traditional style. Prepare to do LOTS of walking. Good for people who have have plenty of time to spend in Seoul. If not, you can skip this place. It was just okay."
Walking experience,I would suggest walking the neighborhood. The place reminds me of the old Seoul that I used to know as a child. There are a few restaurants around here but nothing special. 
Great walking & window-shopping area; the folk village is charming,"The little alleyways full of traditional workshops and homes are beautiful, and this is a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of nearby Jongno and Insadong."
Amazing traditional Korean houses smack in Seoul!,"This is my second visit here (my 1st was in September 2012), and this time I made sure I covered the area (see my earlier review). I think September is a better time (maybe even October) because one gets to see the greens turning colors with the autumn coming. Last year I even spotted a pear tree. Make sure to come in the morning when the sun is not so high up because it sure gets hot when you walk around admiring the houses in the quite hilly area, houses that have been maintained and live in. Get the map from the tourist information center as you walk from the metro exit towards the Bukchon area. You will also be informed of the house number where Korean dramas have been filmed i.e Lee Min Ho in Personal Taste and Jung Yong Hwa in Heartstring - just the outside people:("
Are we still in Seoul?,The most impressive feature of Bukchon Village is that it is nestled in the heart of a global metropolis. You will be amazed that such a traditional village exists and wow just about everything you see. A truly must see for anyone coming to Seoul.
Hidden residential area in downtown Seoul,"This is a lovely neighborhood, with private houses more than a century old. It's nice to stroll the narrow streets, avoiding the tourists groups,that annoy the locals so much. Signs are placed in many walls, reminding the visitors these are family homes and asking for silence.A couple of such houses allow guided visits to admire the interiors. The lack of furniture there is to see is compensated with an intresting and versitle distribution. Take the time to visit one of this houses."
Two thumbs up!,"Love the charm of this place, like walking through the""old Korean time"". Do plan to drop by Bukchon Hanok Village when in Seoul"
Small houses on a steep hill,"If you want to see small houses on a very steep hill with lots of time to kill, here is a suitable place. This used to be a rundown and cramped lower middle class area which failed to draw attention by the destroy-anything-old syndrome of the 1970's and 80's building craze in Seoul. Most of the grand mansions down below on more habitable flat ground were long gone even before that period. Now there are only two homes worth mentioning in the area. One belonged to former President Yun--a 99-unit home in traditional Korean style. The other is at the summit of Bukchon--a genuine Victorian home. In any case, both homes are privately owned and not open to the public. The small houses in Bukchon are also privately owned and are not possible to visit inside. Those few that are open to the public, you have to pay an entrance fee! Why on earth would anyone be interested in visiting a claustrophobic home that somehow avoided demolition decades ago? Bear in mind, they may be well-maintained now but are not homes built two, three centuries ago. It is shameful and embarrassing that there isn't a single area of grand old residential homes surviving in Seoul. If quaint charm is what you are looking for, try Hannoversch Münden in Germany with homes more than 600 years old. Or Dinkelsbühl. Or San Gimignano in Italy. A bigger city? Try Florence. Bigger? There is always Paris."
Scenic,"A very short walk from the Folk Museum, this suburb is wonderfully scenic, though small. Stop at the tourist information centre for a more detailed map and directions. They are multilingual."
Peaceful and very pretty,"Walked around Bukchon Hanok village for hours, taking pictures and loving the pretty traditional houses. We only found one of the eight photo spots but it didn't matter, still got to enjoy amazing views ^^ Be prepared to walk up and down a lot, this place sure has a lot of hills"
Great area,Loved walking around this area. We went into one of the traditional hanok village building and did a stamp rubbing and had some tea. Really interesting place to see. 
interesting area,"interesting architecture, small modest museums, and craft displays. Bring a map (available free at tourist center) so you don't get lost."
Favourite Seoul suburb,"If I were to move to Seoul, this is where I'd stay. Love the quaintness of the whole suburb with its mixture of new and old from residences to shops to museums. Will probably need 3 days to complete the whole suburb and take in the sights, not counting the palace visitations! Bukchon sits between 2 palaces. The area is pretty hilly where the houses/hanoks are and a gentle hill where the main shopping street of Samcheong-dong is. If you're looking for local designs and quirky what nots, Samcheong-dong is the place to go."
Beautiful area,"Bukchon is a lovely place to walk around. It's not as big as I expected after visiting the hanok maeul in Jeonju, but it's pretty (great views from the tops of hills) and has lots of little shops."
Nice,This place was a little hard to find. The tourist info office was closed when we arrived at the area around 9am so we had to ask people in the street for directions. which is a bit of a task because few can speak english. It's a good place to see. We went inside a private house where the girl guide explained the traditions of Hanuk houses. (charged us 10000 won).
Nice traditional houses of Korea,This would be a good place to visit if you want to see the traditional houses of Korea. Most of these houses have people living in them so we had to make sure not to make too much noise while we were visiting the place. There was a couple of houses where they actually allowed you to go in and take pictures but I guess it's all up to the owners. There are museums and workshops inside too but we didn't manage to visit them all as we didn't have enough time. Would definitely come and explore more again if I had the time.
Travel back in time to old Korea...,"Bukchon Hanok village is an interesting place in the middle of Seoul. It nestled between the 2 main Palaces, Changdeokgung and Gyeongbokgung. Walking distance away from the first, its originally a housing complex for High Ranking Official during the Joseon Dynasty. Now most of the hanok had been turned into museum or cafe but some were still occupied by families. Find a small but beautiful museum here that offers experience in trying out Hanbok, korean traditional costumes. Ended up spending most of our visit to the village taking picture of ourselves in multicolour Hanbok..haha! Unforgettable souvenir from Seoul."
korean traditional houses,See korean traditional houses and the best view of Seoul here. Experience the old world charm and snap beautiful pictures of old houses and alleys.
"A scent of Korean Tradition ""KKok-doo Museum""","I visited Bookchon Twice. When I visited Bookchon on Monday, the main street of bookchon was a bit quiet and not many people around. It was quite enjoyable for me and my friend to walk around Bookchon area. The only problem was the Bookchon Information Office was closed on that day. Fortunately we met two Bookchon tour guides, who provided us with a proper tour map and explained to us how to reach the lane with many traditional Korean houses. Finally we found the lane and had many photo taken in front of a traditional Korean main door. When we were about to leave the lane, a group of Chinese tourists with a guide turned up. It appears that the lane is quite famous. On the way back to the main street, we found ""KKok-doo museum"". I was fascinated by the exibition, älthough the museum is a branch of ""main KKok Doo museum"" located in Haewha-dong. Even so, the exibition items at ""KKokdoo museum at Bookchon"" was facinating. I read a newspaper article before that KKokdoo had an exhibition in London. ""KKokdoo is a human shape craft, which decorated coffin in Chosun Dynasty. In Bookchon area, there are many shops and restaurants decorated by creative designs. I bought many souveniers, including magnets, books and Korean traditional design post-its. I want to visit Bookchon again at my next visit Seoul. This time, I will visit Bookchon perhaps Tuesday. I would like to visit museums and galleries at Bookchon.Tip - Certainly Bookchon is a facinating place to visit, if you like traditional Korean style. Monday looks to be the best day of a week to visit Bookchon, if you want a quiet environment. The only drawback of visiting Bookchon on Mondays is the fact that many galleries and museums at Bookchon and near Bookchon are closed on Mondays. I visited on Saturday and surprised at the crowd. The Bookchon main street was packed by so many people Saturday afternoon."
"One of the few places to see ""old Korea""","Beautiful old hanoks mixed with new ones makes this a special area. Filled with artisan pottery and textile shops along with tea houses, gardens, coffee shop, boutiques and restaurants. It is particularly lovely in autumn when the leaves have turned. "
Bukchon,Wish to visit the inside of the house rather than looking at the over from the roof tops. The free walking tour guide was very helpful. 
Historic district,We were able to have a private tea in the presidents previous residence which is now a high end bed and breakfast. Truly amazing. The entire area is residential but tourists were swarming all over
Quaint,"This neighborhood is awesome, though I wonder how the residents feel. It's great to just explore all of the various tiny (and I mean tiny) roads. Just be respectful and mindful that people do call this place home.I recommend that you go on a weekday to avoid a sea of visitors. I actually went twice. The first time was great because it indeed was a weekday. I decided to return on my last day in Korea to capture a few more photos. This time, it was Buddha's Birthday (a national holiday) and the place was crawling with people posing for photos. Not ideal if you're trying to capture that quaint residential feel."
Well worth half a day,"Situated right next to the main palace, if the weather is right (dry and cool) these streets are worth a visit. Situated in a residential area the houses are lovely to see and so are the cultural museums scattered around the area. With lots of (not cheap) funky coffee shops around you will never be too far from light refreshments. The little nik nak shops are all pretty cool as well.It's very hilly here and the views are delightful but do make sure you have comfy shoes on!TIP: Try not to go on a Monday as many of the museums are closed."
Quaint Historical Neighborhood Alleyways,"A must see in Seoul and good to do this along with the palace tours as it is just east of the main palace. Similar to hutongs in Beijing, these are the traditional Korean style residences perched in alleyways on a hill in Seoul. Great for just wandering and having a coffee break at one of the bohemian coffee shops that artists have around the area.They usually have tourist volunteers on some popular corners where you can get a map and they show you the popular walking routes. You could do this in 1 hour, but definitely worth checking out for your first time visit to Seoul."
If only I have more time,"love this place.... the place is really huge, if you really want to visit all 8 photo spots, remember to wear your most comfortable walking shoes, winter sonata fans, the high school in which the bae yong jun and choi ji woo met is in this area as wellToo bad i went on a rainy day, and I got lost, though we holding a map and asking the locations of the photo spots from the locals, we still got lost, nobody seems to know where the photo spots located"
Love this neighborhood!,"I love this neighborhood. Absolutely adorable and the best place to see traditional Korean houses. Walk around the alleys to soak in ""korean style"" of living. please budget 2 hours."
An old neighborhood on a hill,"A nice glimpse into what Seoul used to look like, but with paved roads and presumably cleaned up considerably. This is a great place to spend an afternoon walking around taking pictures, etc. Lots of cafes in the surrounding area, and on the roads leading up to the neighborhood. Most of them are independent cafes, which is pretty odd because most of Seoul's cafes are the same handful of brands. "
A glimps into old Seoul,After decades of war there wasn't much left of the city but in this place you can still catch a glimps of what it must have been like.
Unique walk in the ancient city,Experience architectural traditional building. Start off the walk by going through some well maintained hanok reaching the top you can see the samcheongdong and gukbyeonggung 
Worth the Hike!,"It was a wonderful area to explore. The view is great, but the walk is steep and winding. Many people have turned their homes into museums, like the Owl Museum. The area below the hill is also great for resting and getting a bite to eat. It was picturesque, historical, interesting and fun. Could be crowded on weekends and holidays in good weather."
A step back in time,"Well maintained, elegant and pretty, this in an area of intrigue. Beautifully landscaped, touristy and endowed with museums and workshops but it is still real place where locals live. A must see! Allow at least four hours. There are numerous places to eat and drink."
Old times,"So, this is what Korea looked like before. Worth a look. But be prepared for the uphill climb. Thought could go in the houses but they're residences! So keep quiet. "
Great walk through time,Preserved homes and lovely walk through the area. Definitely worth a visit. A better tourist map would help.
Combine with palaces and Insadong,"A visit to one or more of the royal palaces, a wander amongst the shops and restaurants of Insadong and around the Bukchon neighbourhood makes for a very good day out in Seoul.The Hanok houses are beautifully maintained and you can pick up a map from one of the Information booths in the area which sets out a walking trail around the area."
Old town of Seoul....,"A nice neighbourhood to have lunch or afternoon ""Koppi"" in.Walk up the maindrag from the ... Metrostation. Do then go into the sidealleys if you want less tourists and more living quarte to SEE."
It's Free,"Visited a few Hanok village. Thought this was excellent. Korea Tourism office, near Angguk Station Exit 3, has a walking trail (you can still get lost as it is not very detailed) which will take you through all the good spots. This is a living Hanok vilalge. Some hills to climb. Average fitness is required, I think!"
Interesting traditional residences,"This is the historic Bukchon Hanok village where some traditional Korean residences have been preserved. Village isn’t quite the term I would give it, as it’s really just a residential district. It may occupy you for an hour or so. The houses may interest you from an architectural and photographic point of view but there’s little else. If you’re in this area then you may as well visit the nearby Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung palaces. "
Great market,Great market to see. Many people speak English. Great mix of old and new. You can see traditional Korean dresses for sale mixed in right next door street food! Reminded me of a county fair in the United States!
Quaint,"Loved looking at the old style homes of Korea. Beautiful architecture and awesome cafe's, restaurants and great shopping. Neat boutiques and stores galore. All outside."
cool area,"Located North east of the main palace I love how this area has renovated and offers lots of shops, restaurants and cafes while at the same time retaining much of it's traditions. Definitely worth checking out"
My favourite escape to the past,If you wanna lost yourself in the hide and seek of a old village inside the city. Escape to Bukchon. First get yourself a guided map at the Bukchon cultural center then seek out the treasures. Its a maze.
Korean traditional houses!,"There are tourist information assistants walking around to provide information and guide in this area. Perfect place for phototaking, the traditional homes are beautiful and there are private houses for korean traditional tea. Cafes and shops - excellent to hang out on a lazy afternoon. Very close to Insadong, which we walked to after visiting Bukchon."
Good way to spend a lazy lunchtime walking,"We spent an hour here just wandering about and having lunch after we visited Gyeongbokgung. It was easy to get here and once you are on the main road you are immediately surrounded by lots of other tourists. The first tourist information booth we saw gave us a walking map which we followed. This was as good a way as any to see the area and get some scenic photo shots. Since we were there on a Sunday, most of the shops/houses that were not on the main road were closed.I was a bit disappointed by the whole thing since it didn't really feel like an 'old town' (in the European sense at least) but DH was very keen to get the photo and video shots so it was worth it for that. Overall, the area is overun by tourists all doing the same thing (heading for photo spots to snap away). If you like that kind of shopping it appeared to have lots of small boutique like shops around the main road which my teenage daughter found quite interesting. Otherwise, it lends itself to just walking around aimlessly taking in the atmosphere. Since it is located right between two palaces, it also makes for a good 'bridging attraction' between the two. Just don't underestimate (like we did) how long it can take to visit Gyeokbokgung. By the time we finished there, looked around Bukchon and had lunch we had missed the timing for the English tour at Changdeokgung."
peaceful,"We found this a very peaceful area of town that was nice to walk around in the morning. We stayed at a wonderful traditional Korean homestay (hanok), and Bukchon was an excellent base for visiting other sights in Seoul. We easily walked to Insadong and Myeongdong from this area. Taking the subway is also very easy as well. As for Bukchon itself, there are lovely traditional wooden houses here and there as well as some interesting western style buildings. We found it an excellent neighborhood to stay in since we were mostly interesting in visiting the palaces in Korea along with some of the shopping districts."
This is the Korean style ;),Go back in time and experience the feel of heavy wooden doors and low ceilinged houses. Be impressed with the cobblestone paths and intricate details of the dainty houses. A map may be provided at the tourist information center near the subway exit. They also have English speaking personnel in the area in case yo needed assistance with the Directions. This is a great place to visit if you have 1-2 hours availability.
very educational,"We went to the Traditional crafts experience center in Bukchon and my daughters enjoyed the workshops they are providing their guests. They tried the dollmaking, dancheong accessory and the jewelry box making. "
Goes with a visit to insadong,"This is a neighborhood of traditionally built Korean traditional houses with a bit of semi traditional houses built in between.Best done with a visit to insadong since this is just a 20minute walk/climb away.the whole bukchon experience-walking around the area-can be done in a maximum of 2 hours.2 hours since there are bits of steep climbs.Regard this as just a walk along a neighborhood and you will not be disappointed...there are areas where you get a nice view of the palace and walls.This is a residential area where people are still going about their daily lives,best to keep this in mind.some houses are open to receive visitors for a fee.inquire at the tourist kiosk found before entering insadong street.ask for a map of a walking route and to see which houses are open.Only for the able bodied.kids strollers ok as long as the kid can climb on his own when the climb gets too steep and uneven."
Old Korean feel,"Here you will see their old traditional Hanok Village. There are about 8 photo spots where you can snap beautiful pix with stunning backgrounds! Along the way, alot of cafe and waffles shops. Drop by for a tea :)"
A Happy Accident,"I was looking for Changdeokgung Palace and was relatively lost when I found Bukchon Hanok Village. The first thing I saw were the quaint cafes around it, then I decided to explore and saw the neighborhood. It's quite a sight to see the hanoks all clustered together, their roofs very distinct in the horizon. If you're lucky, you might find a hanok that opens their doors for you to visit for a fee. I found one at 47 Bukchon-gil 11, and was completely entranced with the architecture and design of the hanok. The owners will allow you to enjoy the view while drinking tea. It was fascinating to go around the hanoks and see the old mixing with the new. You could probably spend an afternoon here just strolling through the streets. If you get lost, try to look for people roaming in red vests. They're tourist information people who speaks English. They will basically help you around the village and give you a map of the vicinity. They were really helpful. I found some of the nicer parts of the village through them and managed to get directions going to Changdeukgung Palace."
Worth a visit,Quaint little neighbourhood. It's actually an old residential neighbourhood. There are also many small cafes around (try their patbingsu! shaved ice). Overall a nice place to visit
A bit disappointing,"I had a difficult time finding the more scenic areas here and became rather frustrated. There are however many great shops and cafes in the area. I'm glad I took the time to do this, but I was looking for something more than just another shopping area in Seoul."
Walking along BKCHON,I read the review and walked along the trail but could not find the beautiful scenery spot that they were talking about. There were too many people walking along the same path and most of them were playing. There is nothing much to do as most shops were closed on Sunday.
Tradition in a modern city,"I read some of the reviews wondering what people expected to see and why they were so negative. Bukchon is a gem: it is extraordinary in a city where anything built per-1980 is ""old"". Several hundred single storey houses in a tight little area in a city where real estate prices are sky high and the pressure to develop is intense is a testament to a combination of good fortune and enlightened government. A stroll through Bukchon is delightful and there is always the opportunity to dive into a gallery or coffee shop if the slight climb to the top Is too much effort. It is no wonder that film crews are regularly found preparing their scenes for Seoul-based soaps.I imagine many reviewers go on package tours. That is a mistake in Seoul - everything is so accessible and the delight is coming across little lanes almost by accident. So it is with Bukchon. All you have to do is walk between the palaces (less than a kilometre) and you are then in the midst of a wonderful example of modernity embracing a piece of history. "
nice pre-dinner walk...,"...if you like steep up and down! But seriously, tucked away next to the Gyeongbokgung Palace, it is a fascinating area with many original cottages preserved, most still lived in, some converted to living workshops or little museums. Tourist guides literally patrol the streets in the area to be at hand to answer any questions - brilliant."
Take a stroll,"It's easy. You can stop by the Bukchon Traditional Cutural Center as we did-empty and lifeless when we were there-and pick up a map, or just take a stroll. Poke down alleyways to find galleries and artists workshops. We stopped in the Bukchon Arts & Culture Museum. Interesting collection but the docent couldn't be bothered. in great contrast, very helpful staff at the Asian Art Museum and the brand new branch of the Kokdu Museum located in a traditional Korean house (hanok) at 48/48, 11-gil, Bukchon-ro, Jongno-gu. Three dollar entry fee, a delightful collection of carved figurines that come from funeral biers, and the pleasure of being in one of these old houses-which is why you came to Bukchon in the first place."
"worth a look, but nothing special","Maybe I just didnt find the right part, but it didnt seem like there was a huge amount of old architecture there"
Interesting,"This might be a little hard to find, and many might not find it worth it after you see it, but it's very interesting to see this traditional housing and how they are built."
A glimpse of the traditional Korean home,"When we were walking along Bukchon (the start of which is about 500meters from the Anguk Station exit 2), you start to feel that you really are in Korea as you see the traditional houses around you. We went there during the weekend and there were some very helpful tourist guides stationed in certain areas to direct you to the different spots with the best views. "
The best spot in Seoul,"The most beautiful place in Seoul, I think.You can feel the traditional beauty of Korea with the traditional houses in 북촌. I love there and I go there sometimes for a photo shoot."
Not enough hanog for me...,"Bukcheon is supposed to be Seoul's old historic quarter and while it still does have a few quaint Korean-style houses (hanog) to see (which, incidentally, are much prettier than traditional homes in, say, Japan), the folks here have been very inconsistent at keeping their historic archictecture, if they ever tried to at all, so the hanog, even in this most historic part of town, come interspersed with thoroughly modern functional buildings -nothing even close to the solidly historic neighbourhoods of many European cities. One of the hanog I saw sported a mass of barbed wire all over the garden wall, which was not exactly a pleasure to look at. Still, it is a precious piece of heritage as all the other historic architecture (the very small amount left of it) in Seoul are either religious or military/government buildings, not civilian ones, so this is both special and something ordinary people can more easilly relate to. It is possible to stay in a hanog bed and breakfast in Bukchon and this would be something I would definitely go for. I only had dinner in a hanog restaurant here and it was a great experience, although of course you need to be able to be comfortable sitting on the floor."
Not impressed...,"It's really nothing special to me and really didn't impress me compared with other Asian attractions...If you have limited of time in Seoul, I would say you don't miss out much if you skip this."
somewhat overrated ,"this place is easy to find, about 200m from the Anguk station. But is it a traditional village, or residential houses that look traditional, or handy craft workshops or...the highest concentration of coffee shops in the world within a square km? it is all of the above...cute? sure but it wears off after five minutes...my girlfriend summed it up: it costs 3000won to visit the palace but it costs 10000won to visit someones house in bunchon?"
Old Houses as you are in Korean Drama,I got a map from Seoul tourism office and walk around this unique neighborhood. There are 8 photo stops and lots of supposedly traditional crafts exhibition. It is great to take pictures outside but a lot of times I have to be careful not to be run over by cars. Since people still live in this area.
traditional houses!,the view is awesome. we just walked around and it was strange; contrast between the high scrapers and the old village. It is very beautiful. 
Traditional Korean houses,"Lots of good food in this area. They don't speak english but they have pictures of the food and brief description and the prices are posted. Here you can see traditional korean houses and can try/wear their traditional outfit called Hanbok. Up to the top at the end of the main street, you'll find the Private School as seen on the famous K-drama, Winter Sonata. A few teahouses and guesthouses in the area too,"
Reminiscent,You can get a free travel guide from the seoul tourist office or walk around yourself in this quaint residential area that showcases the preserved old korean houses even cobbled paths. It is quite interesting and admirable that they have chosen to preserve this community amidst the unceasing urbanisation of seoul
Historic Seoul - A Must for Photographers,"This is a nice place to visit for a quick walk around and some sight seeing. We spend all of about an hour here, but it was nice to walk around the streets and see the old houses (hanoks) framed against the skyscrapers in the background.There are a few hanoks that operate as tea houses and B&Bs now, so there is an option to get inside if you like (we did not).I'd recommend not driving through here. It's tight and crowded with tourists. We saw one car get quite damaged trying to turn around."
A Glimpse of Old Korea,"The thing about our afternoon in Bukchon is that we explored it on our own. It was a freezing afternoon (a windy -4 degrees Celsius!). We saw a lot of the hanoks from the outside, but only got to go in one of them, which was a bed and breakfast place. There we got to rent one hanbok each, and take pictures of ourselves in traditional Korean costumes and accessories. It was so much fun! Had we planned our Bukchon visit better, we would’ve been able to do so much more that the place offered: participate in Korean handicraft making, learn to make kimchi, among other things. But it was a good walk anyway, like a blast from the past of Korea. There were a lot of independent cafes and small stores that were really interesting. The lunch we ate at one of the cafes in Bukchon was probably the best one we had our entire trip in Seoul.Bukchon Traditional Hanok Village is a definite must-see when in Seoul."

Couldn't find this place!,"We couldn't find this place and couldn't get much help too but we walked around that area and it was quite interesting, saw a protest and had good lunch :)Make sure you know where to go unlike us :P"
Korean Traditional Village,"ok, this is a small neighborhood up on top of a hill that is full of traditional korean homes. They are very nice with amazing wood work. the homes are set up around a central courtyard, and several offer tours for a small fee, dont miss out on at least one of the tours, and dont skip this attraction because of the steps, it will be worth walking up all the steps for sure."
A walk into the past,"Bukchon is like a tiny maze with lots of tiny streets appearing at unexpected corners. It's a peaceful neighborhood. If I could afford it, I would buy one of the hanoks there! The architecture really fascinated me. I even got the chance to see how a hanok was built. The frames were fused together by joints and not nails. A walk uphill will reward you with a great view of the heart of Seoul. Within the neighborhood, there are cafes, galleries and museums. You might want to pop by one of the tea houses as well. Don't be afraid of getting lost in Bukchon. Volunteer guides are present at selected spots. Thanks to them, my friend and I had a good walk around the neighborhood and out to Samcheong-dong, just outside of Gyeongbukgung. You would need to spend a couple of hours wandering and taking photos. Don't rush past this place."
The best Chill-Out Palace,"I found my dream cafe in Samcheong-dong. The nice cafes is a mix between modern and traditional. You find modern cafes, housed in traditional looking building. A must try is waffles and coffee in any of these cafes.Just sit and people-watch and see the world goes by at these cafes. Do take a slow walk up to Bukchon Hanok Village. You find very unique Korean Traditional House. There are 8 photographic spots. The unique thing is the locals still resides in this traditional houses. Do spot for persimmon trees growing at the higher ground of these residences. Definitely a place recommended to visit. Read More on: http://snewthewanderlust.blogspot.sg/2012/12/bukchon-samcheongdong-seoul.html"
Bukchon Hanok Village," This is a really sweet place to go, there is also a Buddhist temple near by, which you can go to, these are traditional Korean Houses that have a variety of things going on, you can make traditional knots or create some traditional paintings, they cost a little, but not much and it makes a fun day out.Worth a visit, they also have good tea houses in the area."
Traditional Houses,"quite ok for those who like to see the traditional houseshowever, we did read about the history and etc about this houses at the museum before entering the area....its ok if you didnt choose to look at the houses.. all sorts of information can be found at the mueseumwe walked quite a distance from end to end of this areaits a great experience nonetheless.. there are tourism staff available to assist you should you face difficulties in finding the housesdown the hill...is an array of boutiques, cafes and etclotsa coffee shops/cafes..."
Charming walk,"Awesome juxtaposition between traditional Hanok rooftops with the Seoul skyline in the background. You will get some absolutely picturesque shots here. Do drop by the tourist information center to get the handy map with photospots clearly marked for the camera-totting tourist! Also, there are all sorts of arts/handicrafts/cultural experience workshops. We didn't get to try any but they look really good!"
Nice walk,Nice but a bit disspointed as there isnt much to see. There are some good houses and residents are well off judgibg by their cars etc. Fairly commercialised
I WOULD DO THIS AGAIN,"After taking the city bus tour (hop on-hop off), I chanced upon a website in their brochure where you could book a walking tour in a hanok village. When the day came, I wasn't sure if I would show up or not because of the cold. In the end I did. And now I would like to go back there sometime!What was so good about the tour? Well, the volunteer guide was a friendly, engaging chap. And the village itself was a sight to behold - with snow covering the rooftops and the green pines. We got the chance to do some interactive touristing: gold leaf imprint (spent about an hour there!!!) and dyeing. Of course you would have to pay for the materials (e.g. 100% silk scarf, silk bookmarkers or cards) used during the 'demo' but it was worth every won!I spotted a hanok that accepts people wanting to stay in to experience the life. I hope to do this the next time I visit Korea (preferably in spring). It should be very interesting to be exposed to how Koreans lived in the past, wouldn't it!!!My big regret: going there on a Monday so the embroidery and knot museums (2 Korean things that fascinate me) were closed. But I shall return!!!A TIP: you could explore the village (where we went was in the ANGKUK stop) on your own. But to save time, it is best to ask a volunteer tour guide to accompany you. Hope you get as lucky as we are to get a very affable one! We even got to have coffee and donuts in a nice office with his churchmate, a soft-spoken journalist who spoke English. You can check out the Korean Tourism website for info about how to book one."
Walking in the Past,"Seeing these homes - and people are still live in them today is amazing. It is very quaint and worth walking the neighborhood. If you watch Korean dramas, you'll recognize that they use these houses and streets a lot as the setting for their stories."
A very lovely area,"It was relatively easy to navigate to the Bukchon Hanok area from the subway station, because there were helpful tourist info helpers along the way who provided maps and pointed us in the right directions. It is an extremely lovely and pleasant area to walk around, and do visit one of those hanok-converted museums to learn more about the hanoks. "
Interesting place and a different view of Seoul,"Bascially if you like to have a look at how a hanok house looks like, this is the place. They have interpretors around, dressed in red tops, and get a map from them! The mapshows you the different areas of the village and where the good spots for photo taking are. Try it if you can since it's free entry anyway. "
Mix of old and new,"I want to call this area 'cute' but that seems patronizing, but I do think the old houses and buildings are quite cute. There are many new buildings in this area as well, as well as shopping and food."
Time stands still,"If you like the traditional houses (Hanok), you have to make a trip here and get lost among these houses. It gives a nostalgic feel and there are some traditional centres around to teach traditional skills such as painting and knot-tying. "
Cafes Galore,"Long street with plenty of boutiques, jewellery shops and cafes selling coffee & waffles. Apparently eating waffles is a romantic Korean thing to do these days. Very quaint!"
Scenic,"Interesting place to relive how traditional Seoul was like. Pretty near from Gyeongbukgong, it would have been more fun if we stayed there, or took some of the classes."
Cup half full,"Entering Bukchon I was initially disappointed. It is a western influenced part of town owing to the wealth there. After passing umpteen coffee and waffle shops along a street with obvious European influence, we moved up the hill. There the residential quiet along with the gorgeous views of the city and the fall colors took over. The actual ""traditional houses"" are largely eitherrenovated or reconstructed to look old, but they are charming, especially when you come across a lane of them together. When there isn't a tour group or a late model luxury sedan nearby, you can almost imagine what the area might have been like for a rich Seoulite a century ago."
Best at dusk.,"If you want some good light for photographs, definitely go for a look around dusk. I have some amazing pictures of Bukchon Hanok Village. This area is really the sort of place where you can wander around for a couple of hours and just get lost in the maze of streets. One thing I was disappointed with was the advertised Bukchon Hanok lookout... it was at the top of a persons' house on their balcony and was around 5000 Won. Not worth it! There is another panoramic view you can check out not far from there, it's just a little lower, that's all."
RASC Day Tour,We went on a walking tour with the Royal Asiatic Society. The guide was well informed and gave a lot of interesting info about the place. It was very pleasant to walk through this part of Seoul and well worth it if you are a resident of tourist...
Worth a visit for the handicraft classes,"I found the Bukchon Hanok village to be rewarding soley for its nifty handicraft classes. The area is dotted with different ""museums"" where you can practice everything from Korean calligraphy to knot-tying. You can find some truly unique gifts here that are superior to anything I have seen in Insadong. However, if you are not shopping, I suggest visiting other areas. I feels a little tourist trappy."
Seoul's best kept secret,"Nestled behind the imposing and majestic Kyeong-Buk palace and a stones throw away from the president's residence 'the Blue House', Samcheong dong really is Seoul's best kept secret. Although it has an exclusive feel, it is very easy to get to: just follow the road which hugs the right side of the palace (if you stand at the entrance). Art galleries line the right side of the road and soon you will hit a feast of little artisan shops selling jewelry, shoes, clothes and other goodies. You would be forgiven if you got slightly confused as to whether you were in Europe or Asia. If your feet get tired, you can enjoy Korea's thriving cafe culture with a warming coffee and perhaps that cafe's special snacks and cakes. There are some very high quality restaurants on the main road which typically specialise in only one or two main dishes. You may think that you have seen enough on the main road, but do take the time to get lost in all the little alleyways. Don't worry, they all lead back to each other but it is in these tributaries where the true spirit of Samcheongdong can be discovered. You will see wall art, quirky shaped buildings, vintage clothes shops, ceramic wares for sale. You might even get to see a craftsman at work. I don't want to name specific places because the whole point is to go and find things for yourself with a blank canvas and open mind, but if you are fortunate enough to find the tiny alley cafe that sells patbingsoo, don't be put off by the fact that the waiting list is already an a4 side long....that's a quiet day! Samcheongdong is a refreshing celebration of creativity, self expression and talent. It's on my must-do list every time I go back and if you've never been, my question to you is...why ever not?!!!!"
A historic place to discover in Seoul,One of the best place you must see if you want to feel an authentic Korea traditional house.Terrific place with an awesome view and tt is nice to walk through the street to visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace.
Great sites of historic Seoul,"This is a very fascinating area, and a definite visit if in Seoul to get a sense of culture, history and tradition. The Bukchon Hanok Village is nestled between the Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Changdeokgung Palace. It is located in the Insadong area of Seoul and an easy walk from the Angkuk subway station. The history of the village goes back 600 years, but the area has been preserved and reconstructed to the way it was. The narrow streets and the walls are all brick. Many winding hilly paths, and great views of the old Korean residential neighborhoods. There are still people living in these houses and also some people still working their businesses out of these houses. The problem is if you start on one path and continue, you my not see what is in the other direction. There really is no specific course to take so it is pretty much on your own instincts. There will be modern structures also as you go thru the area, maybe a place for a meal or drink and of course souvenirs, but not in a tacky way. It is a great picture taking attraction. "
Combine with Samcheong - dong,The Korean tourist office put out an excellent walking map of this area - do the walk late afternoon and stay on for dinner in Samcheong
Combine a great walk with some dinner,Go at various times of the day if you can - the light in the late afternoon is lovely and then stop at a roof top restaurant for dinner - lots to chose from
Charming,"Little but charming. I was lucky enough to visit it during a special week for foreigners, when they offered traditional Korean medicine advice and treatment inside the hanoks, by young doctors wearing traditional clothes - and their English was really good!!!"
Traditional houses,There are lots of tourists in a residential area. It's interesting to see traditional houses. It's a beautiful corner ; it feels peaceful. 
Traditional Korea,"This neighborhood is quaint, looks and feels like traditional Korea, and has been taken good care of. It's simply a delight to walk down the streets and check out the various shops and buildings. If you want the complete Korean experience, stay in a guest house!"
North village old v new,"We had a great time exploring Bukchon for an afternoon - there are so many amazing sights and it's fun meandering through the alleyways enjoying the old traditional Korean architecture, some houses with more modern additions and also the quaint coffee shops, art shops and other interesting restaurants along the way. Found a great little store near the observatory where they take ideas from anyone willing to submit online and if they like it, they manufacture the product and cut you in on the deal. Some amazing and creative things to buy - spent half an hour there! Great place for exploring the more artsy side of Korea - close enough to Insadong, the Palaces, Jongno and the Cheonggyecheon stream to make a lovely day of it!"
Interesting place with the traditional houses,the bukchon hanok village was interesting and we could see how the traditional korean houses looked like. some points also had views of the city!
A Blast from the past!,"It's like living in Korea long before western influence dominated the skyline.Typically a korean village set in a long forgotten era of kings. noblemen, and commoners."
Glimpse of the Past in Modern Korea,"If you are visiting this place, do also set aside some time for the nearby Samcheong-dong Bukchon area, which has quaint cafes and street shopping. Over here in Bukchon, you get to see the traditional look of the villages. My feel is that while the facade has been perserved to some extend, you cannot help but feel that that is all that is there. The neighbourhood is actually quite a wealthy people place. While you walk around, just be considerate, do not make too must noise, and try not to intrude into areas you are not suppose to go into. The view from the top is quite nice showing the old houses with the city view in the distance.You will also notice it's quite ""touristy"" - meaning many tourists will pay this place a visit, so just don't expect it to be exclusively just you and the place with great quiet. Nevertheless, you can try visiting on weekdays, hopefully it will exclude more locals from the visitor count :)"
Quaint Leisure Walk in a Cafe Filled Place,"Would be nice to walk along the road, and see the cafe lining up the road, and the shops selling interesting stuff in the back lanes and smaller roads. Feel free to stop and have a cake, snack, coffee or tea, and watch the world go by. If you are done in the cafe area, walk up the hill to the Bukchon place to see traditional houses from a higher ground, and travel down. Nice place to walk around on foot for an afternoon! =D"
Just a peek of the real Korean Traditional House,"The Bukchon Hanok village is quite big if you are on foot. The tourist information center near the Bukchon Village Cultural Center provides a walking map. Follow the 8 view of Bukchon Hanok village in the map, if you are interested in taking great pictures of all view. If you are just plain lazy to walk, hit the number 4,5,6 and 7 picture spots which are around each other. if you are afraid of getting lost, you can join one of the walking tour provided (free but at scheduled time).All the exterior of the hanok looks almost the same, and it is a shame that tourist cannot enter any of it. We saw one Hanok that is open for public, but the owner is charging 10,000 Korean won as entrance. That is a hefty price to pay!If you are game for the Hanok experience, some of the hanok have been converted to guesthouse.I sort of pity the residents that are still staying in the hanok, as the alleys are crowded with tourists. The alleys widths are only the size of a car. So you can imagine if some inconsiderate tourists talk louder, the voice will be disturbing the residents.Do come here early to avoid the crowd."
Bukchon Hanok Village-korean drama or not...,"Those who had watched korean dramas may appreciate the actual sites of what you saw, they are different, interesting - but then I like ""old architectures"" unlike my friend who walked with me. I wish I had time to really walk all the streets and imagine how life was then. I appreciate that this hanok village has been preserved amidst the city buildings. And there were guides to help you when you're lost in that array of old streets and hanok houses.To guide to where this drama or that drama was filmed. You can walk to Insadong for souvenir shopping when you are done sight seeing."
Quaint village within a mega city,"Bukchon Hanok Village is a neighborhood of old houses on top of a hill overlooking downtown modern Seoul. To reach here you can go to Anguk station. The houses themselves are lovely to look at, with their old architecture style. Some of the houses are still occupied by residents but most of them have been turned into museums, craft shops, or cafes. It is a great way to spend an afternoon walking through the narrow alleyways and taking photographs along the way. We booked a walking tour of this neighborhood which I strongly recommend. Our guide took us to see 8 spots in the village and each one had a different history. This village is situated between the 2 major palaces of Seoul so arrange to see at least one of them after you visit the village. Afterwards you can have lunch in one of the local restaurants along Samcheongdong. After lunch we walked through Insadong, then we walked along Cheonggyecheon stream which is lovely (and we decided to return to it the next day and walk along its length) and then we walked to Myeongdong. A lovely walk through old and new Seoul."
Lotsa Traditional Korean Houses & Nice View from the top,This is located on top the streets of SamCheong-dong. You will see stairs leading up the hill when U r walking along Samcheong-dong. Climb them & viola! U r at the Bukchon Village.
Best street in Seoul,"Made it to Samcheong-dong by accident. My sisters and I were walking around Bukchon, when we realized that we're lost. Somehow getting lost was fun because we came across this dainty street. Samcheong-dong is parallel to Bukchon so it was nice to see two cultures that Seoul offers: traditional and modern. Samcheong-dong is lined with low rise buildings that are well thought off. The paintings on the wall, water hydrants that has designs and cute little shops make walking and taking pictures around Samcheong-dong worth visiting."
Nice to visit,"For the real experience, stay in a Buckchon. Else you just walk the small corridors, but you don't get the real feel for the place."
Interesting folk living,"Just like much of the old Korean architecture, most of Seoul was destroyed in the Korean war and in rebuilding, several areas were rebuilt to dimensions of the old style villages that Seoul originally began as. There are a plethora of small shops, museums and art centers. Weekends are the time to visit, as the areas are residential and more are open on the weekends. Interesting, but not more then other Korean sites."
A Walk,The architecture of the traditional houses were beautiful. Will need a good pair of shoes and strong legs. Some of the streets were winding and slightly sloppy. It's not as crowded as Insadong which was nearby. I will like to visit it again and have a cuppa of coffee in one the cafes.
nice back in time area,"go there on sundays. walk around, shop for great souvenirs, food and delights, rest in a coffee shop, buy great tea to bring home. don't forget your camera."
Worth your time,"When you think how Seoul was flattened in the Korean War and how modern times results in conformity in dress, architecture and lifestyles, be certain you don't miss this village for a sample of traditional Korean house architecture. "
Quiet street of Seoul,"The Village is like a museum exhibit, only later will you realize that the houses there are actually lived-in. I like the various art shopes in the fringes of the Village. A must visit area after a stroll in Insadong, has a good view of the Korean Folk Village Museum and Gyeokbokgung Palace. "
Beautiful Hanok Village,You have to visit this place. There are so many little corners to explore and the old Hanok structures gave us a great old feeling vibe. It also feels very trendy here. Look out for the uphills and downhills.
Having a waffle at Samcheong-dong,I enjoyed my short time here. The locals are trendy and there are so many things to see. My girlfriend and I found a little coffee house nestled at the corner of one alley way. They served up awesome waffles with coffee. We chose to sit outside to experience the Autumn breeze. It reminded me of those romantic Korean movies that I used to watch. Of course people watching here is great too.
Cafe is everywhere!,"Good place to find a cute cafe and relax! Love the area there! It's much like those which in Korea drama, so cute!!"
Good,It's good place if you would like to see some traditional houses in Seoul but you won't stay long there as the houses are not open to public. Just take some pictures will do :)
Should not be missed,"The old hanok houses which are so quaint. Its nice to walk in the alleys and look at the architecture, enter the art galleries, small musums, shops selling hand made crafts, tea cafes, great photos will come out of this walk...definitely should not be missed"
information center close on Monday,"i was here on Monday and the information center was closed,but there were a lot of walking information provider which are wearing a red jacket.you can get the bukchon map from them so you can plan the route that you will like to go.I only visit the 5 photospot out of the 8 as not much time i have,if you are really good stamina and have more time,give here a visit for looking at the traditional hanok."
Not much to see,"A few small traditional houses. After seeing the palace nearby, this wasn't too impressive. Just a narrow street on a hill."
wonderful attraction,"good to take a walk within bukchon hanok village and down the hill have many nice cafe , restaurant and boutique, hand craft boutique and art shop.. it is truely a wonderful oasis in a bustling city, up the hill point you could get a view of the city and mountain. must visit."
A rare treat: a sample of old Korean life,"This wonderful oasis of quiet in a bustling city features reconstructed traditional Korean houses, demonstrations of Korean hand crafts, such as basket and shoe making, Korean dancing (check times for shows on bulletin board at village), and a shop selling art work and a bit-better-than-average souvenirs. We did not take the free walking tour offered by Seoul Tourism; however, we had been to other traditional villages throughout S. Korea, and could make comparisons. If your visit is only to Seoul, I'd recommend this village as a good place to see how Koreans lived in the past. There are some steps at this village but also wide, open spaces where wheelchairs can go (albeit a bit bumpily). It's not a huge place, so walking should not be a problem."
Go on a Free Walking Tour to see this village.,"We booked a free Seoul City Walking Tour with Seoul Culture & Tourism Volunteer Guides to see this village. You must book ahead; you can call or book online. They email you a confirmation and tell you where to meet. We went on 3 of these walking tours and all the guides were very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. You are not expected to tip the guides as it is voluntary and the guides are paid a small amount by the government. Have fun as you walk and learn with a local."
A Pleasant Walk in the Past,"This is a great place to visit if you like quiet places, old houses and artsy craft shops. A walkable distance from the subway station, take a taxi from the station if you aren't fond of walking since you will have to take a walk to the best picture stops with a good view of many traditional houses. Other nearer areas are a mix of the old and new houses. If you aren't sure which way to go, you might want to ask the red vested tourist information people standing in strategic corners, like we did. You can go inside some of the houses for a fee, and there are also some houses where there are classes for kimchi making, traditional knotting, embroidery and some traditional musical instrument. Some of the houses have been converted to guest houses and it is nice to take a free peek at the interior courtyard with rooms that open up to it."
Well maintained old style house,It's hard to see those old fashion houses in big city so please enjoy a walk here. Not to make too much noise here as this is a residential area.
my best place in Seoul,"this place was too amazing! lovely art cafes tucked into little corners. the view from here was amazing, can see all of downtown"
Walking besides Gyeongbokgung Palace,"A number of featured shops, food and handcraft stuff. Either Korean style or foreign style. It is nice to walk through the street before or after visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace."
Try a Hanbok,"Take a walking tour of a traditional Korean village, view some demonstrations, learn about how difficult life was before now, and try on an hanbok! "
A Beautiful Place ..,"This place is simply awesome, I love it !Clean, safe and very relax to see the traditional houses along the way.. One thing you should keep in mind that try not to make so much noise during your walk here cos I saw many tourist laughing , talking loudly while taking picture, it's pretty annoying for the residents who live there. I like this place a lot. "
Normal Bukchon Hanok Village to visit,It not so interesting place to visit as it normal village to explore and it locate up in the hill for us to explore.Only there was show for us to see with open air and if sunshine we feel warm.
Randomly discovered,"We were looking around for Insadong and we found this Bukchon area. Its a collection of old houses in traditional designs that have been preserved in this area. I believe that these are all privately owned houses and that this is now a very upscale area.The walk allows you to get a sense of how old Seoul must have felt, as you walk through the alleyways and up and down the walking paths. The nice thing is that they have helpful guides in red uniforms as well as kiosks where they provide maps through the area. Other than the nice old houses, there are a collection of art galleries and coffeeshops that make the entire experience a pleasant way to spend the afternoon."
Well preserved and beautiful,I took a morning stroll along the small hillslope of the village. The area is very clean and the fresh morning air makes the place very nostalgic. I went into the only house that is available to be visited and opened to visitors (for a small fee of course). The house is beautiful and well maintained. We were served with a very nice plum juice before we left. Good to visit early morning when the air is cool and fresh. Take your time to appreciate its beauty.
Very interesting stroll,"We enjoy the visit to this village. It is very near to the palace about 20 minutes from entrance of the palace(side entrance to be precise)We took a walk there and we pass through guards and was told the prime minister or president live around there so you see guards.One get to see the old house and design. very interesting.However some of these homes have modern locks so it really spoil the traditional look.While you walk, there are many shops as well as restaurants serving international food. As this is a tourist area it is not surprisning the restaurants cater to the tourists.Taxis are affordable and cheaper than in Singapore. So after walking,shopping and loads of photos, you may just take the taxi back to hotel. S$10Only caution is you have to walk about. The ladies or guys in red outfit called korean ambassadors are really a welcoming sight. They welcome tourists and help the tourists with their queries. they even recommend what you should see. Do approach them whenever you see one.They are in red outfit with a hat.We guess perhaps because everything is written in teh korean language that these ambassadors coem in handy.Nice place to visit and just have a stroll and enjoy korea as if you are a local."
Beautiful,I stayed a few streets away from and here and it was such an amazing experience to walk a few hundred meters and be transported back into Korea of centuries ago. Give your self enough time to walk about and immerse yourself in the surroundings. A quick pointer some houses here are residential so try not to wonder into someones yard.
quaint charm,a different perspective to the bustling city. what a refreshing change to see that a place like this exist and that the village is an actual residential neighborhood vs a tourist trap. we had to ensure that we behaved appropriately and contained ourselves from prying into homes!
Pretty Houses,"There's not much here apart from pretty houses and people taking photographs. But, the pretty houses are very pretty! And walking up the hill to get to the viewing point is a nice way to walk off a meal ^^"
Well worth a visit,"Really nice pedestrianized area with examples of traditional Korean architecture and crafts. Good coffee shops, very friendly people. "
It could provide a better experience,The place is located on top of a hill from which you can see a good part of the royal palace. It is worth a visit but do not expect much more than sightseeing. It is good if you want to spend 1 hour trying to figure out how old houses were. In the surrounding many small restaurants. 
Back to the past in the heart of the city,"The houses in this village are hanok style and it gives a glimpse of olden days korea among the modern days building. It gives a feeling of going back to the past. Some of the streets in this village gives a very beautiful view of Chandeokgung,"
Quaint neighborhood inbetween two palaces,"Nestled in a hilly location between the massive and boring Gyeongbokgung Palace and the wonderfully thematic, tree clad Changdeokgung Palace, is this residential neighborhood. There are many examples of authentic reconstructions of Korean houses of yore. Some museums abound as well. Start at one palace and walk through this picturesque neighborhood on your way to the second palace."
Private Heritage Residential Area,It is an area where there's concentration of heritage houses. It's paved with pebble stones. It's full of traditional colour and ambiance. There can be lots of tourists that to take a photo without traffic is almost impossible. 
See small houses in old traditional style,"Walking along small roads, looking at people's houses. Not so entertaining. There are some nice corners but this is only a residential area. not a nice place to go expecially during hot summer or rainy season."
Every 'attraction' requires money,"Just the walking tour itself is good. The tourist office provides a detailed map to follow, which was good. The buildings themselves are very quaint and picturesque. However any of the attractions, such as the knot workshop, art shop etc are require a fee. Depends how much you really want to see them. Otherwise just strolling around is a pretty way to spend an hour or two"
You have to visit it to apreciate how meticulous the Korean culture is.,"This might sound ridiculous but I couldn't stop looking at the walls and roofs of the houses on this ancient town, great place to spend a morning and eat traditional Korean food, just be careful when ordering and make sure you are ordering for one person or you'll end with a lot of drinks and food."
Good views to the city.,"What a time we had trying to find the place! Once there we could talk to the red uniformed guides (at tourst places around the city and always in pairs) who spoke English and were friendly.One house was available at 10,000 won to go inside but not much to see other than exteriors unless you took the invitation."
Experience mini SEOUL,"Bukchon Hakok Village was a fantastic experience. The activities available like kite making, weaving, craft knotting and photo opportunities make this worth the visit. Warning don't try to travel there by taxi because the local taxi drivers don't understand even when you show them a map. A suggestion is a travel there via the subway. Its cost effective only costing approximately $1. "
A must do,"I believe it is number one must do in S Korea, go there take some pics of traditional houses."
A must do,"If you visit S Korea than you should allow a good half day to see this place, well worth it for the photos alone."
Lots of traditional Korean houses,"When you walked along Insadong, you should take some time to visit Bukchon, where you can find lots of traditional Korean houses up the slope. Very nice environment to take photos!!"
Away from the high rise,"This is a gem of an area in Seoul with historic houses, galleries and museums, craft shops and cafes. A great walking experience as long as you can cope with some hills."
old traditions maintained and renovated,"I spent two weeks in Seoul and 6 nights in this general area or close to it (being Anguk metro station). So I had 3 separate relaxed wanders through the area, including spending two nights in a hanok room (what's with the Hakok spelling TripAdvisor??). Mind you with a shorter timeframe and a detailed map it is probably only an afternoon for the committed tourist.It has become not uncommon for such ""old"" traditional areas in inner cities to become rediscovered and maintained in their original form. Given that so much of Seoul has been concreted and glassed over thank goodness for that. The walk up some of the steep streets will give you a contrasting vista over the more so-called ""modern"" Seoul - thank goodness for the old wood and stone!A reasonable mix of coffee shops/places to snack and traditional businesses along with some quirky boutique shops."
very crowded,you can walk in great atmosphere and great view.but very crowded. you should visit here in early morning.you can use English guide.
Beautiful traditional architecture in the middle of the city,"We visited Bukchon Hanok Village for an afternoon. It has extremely beautiful traditional architecture and is in the middle of the city so you get an amazing contrast between modern and traditional. It is this contrast that, for me, epitomises Seoul as a city. The most interesting part of the village is that the homes have been restored and are actually inhabited. There are interesting restaurants and coffee shops (and a museam) on the way up to the village from the station and back down again. Seoul volunteers that help tourists make it easy to navigate your way around the place. The downside is that whilst it is nice visiting the village, there is actually not much to do there (unless you sit down at one of the restaurants for a meal or coffee)."
Charming area,"We went up and down the hills to see the views and the traditional housing areas, plus the crafts. There are lots of little gems hidden all over for a camera enthusiast."
Café DoDo 도도,"This is a gem up the hill but well worth the walk, about 10min from Anguk station. It has a nice garden/front porch and a 2-level house. What caught my attention was the coffee roasting machine at the entrance which produces the perfect aroma. The rest of the decor is tasty and simplistic. A bit of retro as well. The waffle with chocolate ice cream is to kill for. The double expresso did not disappoint either."
Nice Place to Get Lost,"The area, which is off Anguk Station Exit 4, is filled with interesting little coffee shops, restaurants, clothes shops and galleries. The place is located in hilly terrain so be prepared to walk up and down roads a lot. "
One of the most amazing places to visit in Seoul.,"Wow. Just... wow. This place is so amazingly beautiful.You could get lost here for HOURS just trying to discover every lovely secret each sidestreet holds. From coffee shops to art galleries to street food and craft and curio shops, Bukchon is one place you can't miss."
Time filler,"Nothing more than a common city block. Traditional house are all private own and you can go in to look inside. Take photo to the roof is the only option. Road is slope and deep high, not recommend for elder and small child "
Nice place,Must remember to go to the tourist booth to get a Bukchon area map before walking around.The map show you where to walk and places to take nice photos. If you have not take a map there are a few walking 'tour guide'that can answer any questions on where you want to go and they have map with them .
Great wanderign around these streets!,Tjis area is just a short walk form Changdeokgung palace and an eclectic collection of trendy shops and authentic old houses! Really interesting wandering around here!
Very Cute and a Little Hidden,"I tried to find this place on my own once, failed, and came back again with my husband. The areas that area easily found are lined with cute little shops, and it feels like some of the hipper spots on the West Coast in the US. Lots of Pasta, Pizza, Waffle, and Coffee places to stop at and people watch. Eventually we found the area with lots of restored houses and I adored it. It you go to the top of the hill, you can see the Blue House very clearly. Overall, I enjoyed this little trip, even though I got lost ^_^If you love old houses or interesting architecture, you'll love this place!"
Different Neighborhoods Lumped Together Offer Variety & Confusion,"The name, Bukchon, or Northern Village, is a new name for an old part of northern Seoul. Actually, Bukchon encompasses Gye-dong, Gahoe-dong and Samcheong-dong. Having lived in Gye-dong for nearly a dozen years, it's been interesting to see the place change while learning about the real history of the place.Originally, the three neighborhoods used to make up a very swanky residential destination due to their location being near the center of power in all Korea, Gyeongbug-gung. Many home owners were lower officials who worked in the court or others who sought residence in the community due to its prestige. Most of the traditional homes, or han'ok, were built during the first couple decades of the 20th century. A few of the largest buildings survive from the middle of the 19th century, but they are few in number.Even back in the 1960's, President/dictator Park Chung-hee recognized the collective architectural value of the neighborhoods. As such, he designated the communities to be an architectural preserve. And so it was until the gradual democratization of the nation descended down to the local village level where denizens could take more matters into their own hands. During the 1970's, 80's and 90's, homeowners envied real estate holders in other parts of Seoul who were able to demolish their old buildings and build high rise apartments and thereby greatly increasing their wealth. So when in the 1990's local governance was granted, the first thing to go was the architectural preservation designation.Immediately, 3- to 8-storied brick cramped apartments and condos were built where the original han'ok once stood. Whole blocks were demolished and to this day the community has not fully recovered. Eventually, entrepreneurs and some enlightened city bureaucrats realized what was happening. They made it more difficult to tear down han'oks and started providing financial incentives to preserve the buildings.Today, Gye-dong is evolving from a sleepy, traditional neighborhood that was the relative step-child of the two other communities. It is now chock-a-block with upscale coffee shops, handmade apparel boutiques and, yes, some of the traditional stores making tofu and rice cakes. It also has some upscale restaurants and is now the latest ""find"" for many Seoulites.Gahoe-dong is both bustling at is south end, just across the street from Insadong, and elegant if somewhat desolate at its higher elevations on the north end. The lower south side is very popular with university students and young adults. It features many small restaurants and boutiques plus a couple of tiny museums. The north end is elegant with arguably the best han'ok collection in Korea. As such, it is the site of many postcard-type photos. However, it is hard to call the neighborhood a community. Most of these large and elegant buildings lack inhabitants other than possibly during weekends, holidays and special events. Many of the buildings have become the playhouses of the super rich who live elsewhere and go ""slumming,"" should that be the right word, in their multi-million dollar playhouses.Samcheong-dong could be compared to some of the nicer shopping communities of Tokyo, if it were not for too narrow sidewalks and the crowded main street constantly filled with traffic as the two-lane street serves as an important traffic artery connecting expensive northern suburbs to the center of Seoul. As a result, pedestrians need to be particularly mindful of cars. Nonetheless, some of Seoul's finest small restaurants and boutiques can be found in this pretty neighborhood.Overall, Bukchon is one of the nicer neighborhoods of Seoul, conveniently located among some of the best palace grounds of the nation. That is why I've lived here so long. At the same time, as attractive as this place may be, tourism propaganda can easily mislead tourists into expecting things that are not quite as implied.Good shoes and a non-hurried agenda are required to enjoy Bukcheon. And while here, you may wish to escape the urban bustle of Seoul by heading into the Samcheong Park that is located north of Gahoe-dong and east of Samcheong-dong. If you are up for a moderately challenging hike, take the trail on the north side of the park that takes one up through dense forest to the north wall of the old city. The dense forest soon hides the visitor from the reality that the hiker is still very much in center of one of the world's largest metropolitan areas."
Gives a taste of old Korea,Brings you back to old K-town in the middle of the city.What made this walk interesting for me is the fact that it leads to Chung-ang High School/middle school!? the filming location for Winter Sonata. (being a Kdrama Addict that I am.)
A walk back in time,"A trip to Samcheong-dong Bukchon felt like being in old Korea with all some Hanok houses converted into Museums. It was a tiring long walk from Anguk passing to Samcheong-dong all the way to Gyeongbok Palace, but it was all worth it."
"Old styles of Korean house, back in 1970, 1980s.","If you walk the small allies of the village, you can feel of 1980's Seoul. most of Korean ""well-living"" class used to live those kinds of houses. You can also have a look inside of Korean guest houses where many tourists stay to have cultural experiences."
Walk & Enjoy,Wear comfy shoes as there is a lot of walking (up and down hill). Try to enjoy the scenery and the peace of mind away from the city. Take little breaks in the local cafes! 
"Interesting, worthwhile","Bukchon village, Hanok houses, old style Korean architecture. Very little remains of this type given the vast destruction during the Korean War and the phenomenal development including massive skyscaperisation in last 15 years or so. The houses are occupied and very upmarket but exteriors have been largely retained. Its a long walk up and down hills, but there are plenty of coffee shops and a few teahouses.Some guidebooks suggest staying here as some of the houses are guesthouses. Coudl be good BUT catch taxis to and from."
below expectation.,Not as interesting as what you see on film or picture. However still worth a visit.
Bukchon - a journey back in time.,"The Korean Government has actually paid the residents of these ancient Hanok traditional Korean houses to have them restored to mint condition. As a result, they are now a tourism attraction in their own right.The area covered is quite large, and needs to be covered on foot. Do also visit the Bukchon Traditional Culture Centre for a briefing on the area. Wonseo-dong is where traditional artists and artisans work. The Bukchon Hanok Guesthouse was once the residence of a famous Korean painter, and now accommodates tourists. "
"OK, but just","Hard to find, not mentioned on the map in the subway.A few nice houses, but lost in the middle of unremarkable buildings.Go if you have time, only."
Picturesque old town charm meets trendy vintage,"Possibly one of my fave spots in Seoul. It's a suburb that mixes the old with the relatively new and the result: awesome.Be prepared to see some old school buildings as well as trendy vintage and retro decors.Getting pricier too, but oh so pretty!Check out pictures on my blog:http://www.girlwhodoeslunch.com/2012/05/just-typical-mid-week-lunch.html"
A lovely stroll through Seoul,Definiely take the time to spend an hour or so strolling through this village. The are lots of very interesting buildings and many fabulous restaurants and coffee shops. 
Nice views.,"This was a nice area to walk in with some nice traditional architecture, however, you aren't missing much if you can't fit it in to your schedule. We went on a Monday as all the museums were closed and enjoyed the walk, stopping in lots of the small cafes. But this isnt the most memorable part of my trip."
Views 1-6,It's great to see such unique architecture still being inhabited. Don't read up on it too much beforehand - they have gone as far as numbering all the 'views' which kinda made my experience feel less unique.
FAB!,The tourist office just up the street from Anguk subway stop is very helpful; the map is great. Follow the map for all the best views. Shops at the end of the walking tour are GREAT! Really wonderful creative products. Be sure to go to the top of one of the hills (well indicated on the map) for a superb view of the rooftop tiles of these old homes.
really?,"I didn't find anything special about this place. Descent walk with a view of many Korean traditional buildings, but those can be found in many other places. Go to Changduk palace (the palace next to Bukchon), and skip this place. I wouldn't not recommend it. If you are looking for somewhere special, I would recommend Korean Folk Village. Yes, the site is awful, but there are more things to see than Bukchon. This place also appears a lot in Korean soap operas."
A step back in time,"This is the place to go if you want to get the experience of traditional Korea. The grounds are beautiful and there are many inexpensive activities you can do there. You can dress up in a traditional hanbok and take pictures. There are tea ceremonies you can participate in, and so much more. "
Heart of Seoul,"This area is really different from anything else in Seoul!! -- Why to go and how to reach it:Seoul is mainly glass and concrete, all very modern, very crowded and noisy. I have been to several so-called Korean villages built purposely for tourists, but did not much like them, they lacked atmosphere, it was more like watching a play. But Bukchon Hanok village is not like that!It is where people actually live. We visited on a Saturday afternoon, but it was surprisingly not crowded, and most tourists behave quietly and seemed to not disturb the residents.It is very centrally located between the two palaces (Anguk st. No 328 of the orange line 3, exit 2) and near Insa-dong (artist street). -- What to do in there:Here you will see narrow winding streets, low-rise traditional houses, many traditional Korean workshops, small art galleries, nice shops with hand-made clothes, accessories etc. and various cafes. The village is situated on a hill, it is all up and down, and it offers a splendid view of the surrounding ""mountains"" at one direction and the metropolitan area with its sky-scrapers and Seoul Tower at another direction. We wandered around for a few hours, took lovely pictures and sat in a cafe on a 3d floor outside veranda. It felt so good and cozy to watch the hills and the small streets and roofs below. A few nice cafes are found on Samcheong-ro, near so-called Bukchon 8th view. There are also restaurants. mostly Korean, Chinese and Italian, but also Indian and fusion. You can also experience traditional Korean arts or even sleep in a Korean homestay. -- Finding your way aroundYou can get a free map of the area from several Tourist Information Centers. I know that there is one at the entrance of Insa-dong street (Anguk st., exit No 6), another one is at Gwangwamun, and two more are in the Bukchon village, you can reach it if you go straight from Anguk st. exit No2 in the direction of hills. The map has a recommended route and photos and descriptions of 8 views of Bukchon. It is a bit hard to follow the route, because the streets are so steep and tortuous, but do not worry, there are plenty of signs with directions and also friendly volunteers are around ready to help you.Overall, I highly recommend to visit this area, it is a most charming and atmospheric place in Seoul! It seems that this area is not widely advertised in guide books and tourist prospects. I am a frequent visitor in Korea, but somehow only found it by chance, never heard of it before this April. I would put it as a Number 1 in Seoul!"
Interesting walk thru history,"Best for able-bodied travellers, the steep streets are charming and the adjacent shopping streets are interesting. I can see that if it is cold or raining the attraction of navigating this area could be diminished. A good map is important, as one can get turned around a bit at the base of the hills where there are no major landmarks. But good for the tourist, there are several ""you are here"" maps located in the neighborhood, just keep an eye out for them."
Nice place the weather distrupt our tour,"We wish we can stay longer to tour around the Hanok area but since it was raining and we were basically drenched, we have to make our tour short. "
Over run by noisy tourists,"We came here also as tourists, but we were mindful that this is a residential area and that people live here, and so we respected their environment and were quiet, but the majority of people, including a lot of school children, were not and they were very noisy, treating it like an amusement park. It is an interesting part of Seoul full of beautiful buildings and history, with great views."
Eating Waffle ..kk,I went there with my senior of Hanyangdae. that street was clean and peaceful. Waffle is not half bad...Delicious. Nice!
oldtown,"if you walk that place, you can feel that you are in the ancient times"
Quite interesting,"It's quite interesting neighborhood, because I think it's the only one neighborhood left which are still in old traditional houses. We didn't wander thoroughly since I got really tired. Here, you can also learn some of their customs and learn a few traditional Korean skills."
Bukchon,Very nice walk to see the hanok village. Visit the tourist information booth and you will be given a map showing the 8 photogenic places to catch good shots of the area. There are guides all around the Bukchon area so you will never be lost. They wear red shirt and will approach you automatically.
Samcheong Dong Bukchon Gil,"Great walk around with traditional house that has been renovated by still keeps the old wall, roof and charm"
Tiring but leisurely walk along small alleys,"Finding the place is a little bit challenge, good thing that tourist information center is available around the areas. It is up a small hill so the walk is tiring but viewing the old traditional houses along the alleys are very relaxing."
Do the walking tour with Robert Koehler...,"This area is amazing to wander through, but even more amazing with the insights from Robert Koehler. Robert runs an afternoon walking guided walking tour every Saturday (to find out about it go to ""Seoul Selection Bookshop""). Robert has a really deep understanding of Korean history and culture and was wonderful to gain his insights whilst walking through such a historical area. We were also able to have tea in one of the Hanok houses. This tour is an absolute must if you are visiting the area."
Great spot for a bit of history!,"Located in the middle of the city, it's a quick and easy chance to experience some interesting architecture and customs! Our family got tickets to the Korean Tea Ceremony and we all enjoyed it! The hostess didn't speak very much English, but we all understood what to do. It was great! And after walking around a bit more, we were off to more sightseeing in the city..."
Bukchon Hakok Village,Great place to see the old old houses of Seoul.. It's so serene and beautiful..
Village within village,"Much better spending your time in the village streets and shops around the Hakok village, which was in itself disappointing. Found delicious ice cream, crazy art and an ice museum!"
great view :),u'll find beautiful traditional house.. be prepared with comfortable shoes :) 
An opportunity to take nice photos,"Clusters of traditional designed residential houses. It is quite a big area so there are several tourist assistants along the way to guide ""lost"" visitors. Lots of tourists particularly Korean drama fans flock to a certain house # 43, just because it was the door front used in Lee Min Ho's drama, Personal Taste. Another favorite spot is Choong Ang Middle School, a shooting location in one of Bae Yong Jun's series. If you have a free afternoon, a stroll along this area would be nice. There are several small museums and houses that offer traditional Korean art activities. Small interesting stores and coffee shops are also in the area. But aside from the above mentioned stuff, do not expect too much. This is just a normal residential neighborhood with beautiful traditional houses. If you plan to just walk around to take some nice photos and not visiting any museums, alloting 2 hours is more than enough."
Worth an experience,"Dont expect mush going to this place or choose to stay in a Hanok, because you chose to stay in an old house hahaha. There isnt good restaurant around the area. But if you want an experience, just stay in Hanok for 1 night, the second nite will be horrible. Trust me!"
Not as good as expected!,This was the most disappointing attraction of all the ones we visited. To be fair it may be that we were here on Easter Sunday and the majority of the craft shops were closed but I did not gain what I expected from this visit.
Exciting experience,A good pair of walking shoes is necessary. Lots of up and downhill. The walking tour gives a good insight to the traditional and cultural of korea. Suggest you spent at least a night in a hanok. 
Wonderful views of Old and New Seoul,"In the beginning I must admit I was a bit worried. I'd seen all these beautiful pictures in korean travel guides but we couldn't find them when we arrived. There were bits and pieces of beautiful old houses here and there, but nothing that looked like a unified hanok village. Luckily we were spotted by two wonderful red aproned volunteer tour guides, who gave us a map and pointed the way to the ""most famous view"" in the hanok village. They weren't wrong. It's a bit of an uphill climb, but when you get tot he top of a row of beautiful hanok houses and look down the street to see modern seoul framed in the distance, it really takes your breath away.Some great waffle and coffee shops abound here. so make sure to sit down and take a break after the climb. One in particular is near the subway exit 3, and serves what is essentially a grilled sandwich shaped like a fish with your choice of savory or sweet ingredients inside."
A must-see while visiting Seoul,"This is a great part of town to walk around. The Bukchon village is a village of traditional Korean homes set on a mountain in the northwest part of Seoul. The roads are steep and twisty, turns, which add to the excitement of exploring this village. At certain points you can get some great photos of the village with the city views in the background. Highly recommended. It is also close to several other tourist destinations in that part of the city, so you can include several other stops during your day."
this is a residential area; don't disturb the people,"This is a real residential area. The signs say not to disturb the people who live there. However, I saw some signs that invite strangers into people's houses for a charge. The map is not very good, but the views are excellent. Very crowded (I went with 2 other people on some Sunday). A lady from my hotel said this village has some tea ceremony, and a lunch break around 12noon-1:30pm, but I did not see where either would be happening. People just live their rich quiet lives there."
Interesting and scenic,"A great walking tour, but the maps need to be updated to reflect current workshops and a better idea of where to go for seeing specific things."
One of the few places in Seoul that is a pleasure to visit,It is generally quiet here if you leave the main street which has little worth visiting. There are a few examples of beautiful architecture here but I believe there is talk of destroying them for more profitable construction. Few people seem to visit the area.
Nothing special really,"This place doesn't have much to offer except coffee shops, restos and shopping stores. It's still a good place to walk around if you're visiting the Bukchon area. "
Traditional Korean Houses,This was the first thing we visited on our first day in Seoul. Travel a bit early if you want to avoid the crowd. Walking around the village gives you that sense of the old Korea. The hanoks look beautiful and well preserved. A must-see for travelers!
The best district for foreigners,"On the all, Seoul is, like Berlin before, not a beautiful city, it is chaotic. Bukchon Hakok Village is the place where you would like to live, small houses, friendly people..."
Complete the 8 spots,"This is a wonderful village i ever visit... the neighborhood are very kind and nice people..they are so helpful, although they dont understand english and we dont really understand korean. when someone ask, they will try to help. Bukchon Hanok Village also famous with their 8spots. Dont miss to complete the 8 spots task. You will see the sceneric places and pictures."
A wonderful day to stoll back in time,Just walk and eat and drink tea and eat and walk and enjoy a sunny day lost in time.
Living heritage village in central Seoul,"This is a well preserved and maintained precinct of heritage domestic dwellings in central Seoul, close to the palaces and other sites of interest. People live in the houses and there are lots of small shops and coffee houses. There are suggested photo spots along pictuesque streets and over the amazing rooftops."
Great day for a walk in Traditional Bukchon Hanok Korea,Step back and step ahead.. the area is a beautiful walk and the quaint restaurants are a change from the busy city fare.. it is good to visit both Palaces that border this area.
An Interesting Contrast to Seoul's Fast Pace & Modern Architecture,"The Bukchon Hanok Village (not ""Hakok"") is a small cluster of narrow twisting lanes where all the buildings are intact Joseon-era residences, most of them 100-200 years old. It is really the only significant historic district left in Seoul, other than the preserved imperial palaces. Seoul is a shockingly modern metropolis, but here is an opportunity to experience Seoul as it used to be. Many of the houses here are still residences today, but there are a number of art galleries, shops and guest houses as well.It is worth spending an hour or two wandering around (easy to get lost, but too small to make that an actual problem). Bring a camera, and a sense of appreciation for a time when life was slower, and everything was made by hand. Bukchon Hanok Village isn't what I'd call ""an attraction"" per se: it hasn't been turned into a tourist-zone, and there's no western fast food places, little English signage, not much glitz and glamour. For some people that's a reason to stay away, but for others that's a big part of what actually makes it an attraction. Note that this is a daytime destination: the area is pretty dark and poorly marked at night. As indeed it would have been 200 years ago...There are plenty of small restaurants in the area, as well as two of the significant palaces (the Gyongbokgeung Palace and the Changdukgeung Palace) to visit. It's easy to get to by Seoul Metro, or a walk from most of the bigger downtown hotels."
"If you want to see 250 coffee shops, this is the place to go","Really disappointing, I can not understand the need for having so many coffee shops. No exaggeration, there are more coffee shops than all the other businesses combined. It would be funny if it wasnt so disappointing. Nothing to see, difficult to navigate super narrow sidewalks. I went on a weekday so it wasnt crowded, but I am sure it is miserable on the weekend."
Great walking tour of traditional Korean architecture,"This is a very interesting place, but make sure to pick up a map before you go."
Awesome place...,"It was really worth the hype. Plus, with all the cool cafes around, I believe I can stay there for the whole day and still enjoy myself to the fullest."
Pictures and Video of Samchung-dong Alleys,"Samchung-dong is one of the best place in Seoul for foreign residents!!!Here we could enjoy the harmony of traditional Korean-style houses and modern building (i.e. a lot of modern art galleries are located on the same street). There are many alleys in Samchung-dong and you can find affordable street foods (like Hotteok) and small accessory shops. Most people who work here are 'okay'(..) with English.You can watch our video for the full details of the visually stunning streets!! :-)""http://youtu.be/R8Rb_XzF2kA"""
A bit of the old Seoul.,Unfortunately there not much of old Seoul to visit so definitely a must.
Bunch of Korean traditional houses.,"Its nice to walk around. also nice looking coffee shops, restaurant. Must visit!"
Pleasant surprise,"The place is easy enough to access by subway. A 5 min walk will take you to an intersection where the information kiosk is. Grab a vicinity map, follow the directions and it'll lead you through beautiful shopfronts and buildings that beg for you to slow down to a leisurely pace to appreciate its surroundings. In almost every direction you'll find quaint cafes/restaurants and a couple of eclectic trinket shops. It's just the right blend to cleanse your palate from the overwhelmingly touristy places like Myeong Dong or Insadong."
Korean Hanok Style Village,Going this place is really a cultural walk. The houses are the Hanok style architecture which is a native in Korean. amazing how these houses are kept well. 
quaint place (:,peaceful and quiet place for afternoon tea. There are numerous cafes and tea houses along the street to choose from
Very picturesque neighborhood,"We really enjoyed walking around Bukchon, the largest cluster (~900) of privately owned traditional wooden homes or hanok in Seoul. Beautiful alleys, lots of cafes and a bit of history. Within walking distance to the beautiful Gyeongbok-gung Palace."
Feel Korean Culture,I saw the Korean traditional house and small back street.You can walk to Samcheong Garden in 5 minutes.You can walk to observatory spot which is on the city old wall in 20 minutes.The view is good.It is good tour to try.
Well preserved traditional houses in the middle of the city,Good place for you to see traditional hanok houses - right in the city centre and there are actually people still staying in these houses. Samcheong-dong is now a fancy area with cafes/fine dining restaurants. Nice area to walk around and spend the afternoon in the cafe.
many nice little cafe,here you can find many cafes and art shops in traditional korea house. the street is nice to walk around and you can find many surprise in every little shop
Great place to spend an afternoon,The area is filled with quaint cafes. Great place to walk around after visiting Gyeongbokgung.
Nice artistic neigbourhood,Spent Sunday afternoon there. Lots of nice cafe and gallery in converted traditional Korean houses. Very interesting to see how they preserve the old distric yet to make use it for new modern activities.
"an ""old village"" in a ""modern city""","Anyone who loves traditional houses, want to be away from hustle and bustle, come to Bukchon Hakok Village. Lots of small interesting cafes, handy craft shops, artists workshop can be found in this beautiful village. We explored different photo spot in this village which are marked on the floor. The atmosphere is serene, just walk into any of the cafes and you can enjoy a lazy afternoon watching the clock slowly ticking away and have a nice cup of ""hand drip coffee"". Visit Bukchon Hakok Village when you are in Seoul, just bear in mind that local residents respect privacy, so do not walk into their house without knocking.."
True Korea,It's great to see how tradition and modern life blend to become one of the most interesting areas in Seoul. Samchong Dong is a great place to hang out on the weekend and enjoy a coffee and a waffle while watching the yound and afluent Koreans passing by. At the same time strolling through the little alleys and watching all the traditional and renovated buildings gives you a feeling how Korea must have looked like many years ago.
"Quaint, Charming Neighborhood","This is a very pleasant area to wander around and see a mix of traditional homes, cafes, art galleries and the like. I enjoyed it very much. There is a wonderful little tea house that serves the most amazing tea and red bean soup. I don't know the name, as I have no English translation for it...only a picture I took with the Korean signage. I'm sure that there are lots of hidden gems equally as interesting that one can find in this neighborhood just by spending some time leisurely strolling around...there are many surprises, which is what makes this area interesting."
Nice Place to Explore,"This is a nice neighborhood to explore, from the old traditional homes to the modern art galleries to cultural centers. It has a lot of tourist groups, but they usually disappear if you're taking side streets or exploring hidden corners. I suggest starting at the Bukchon Traditional Culture Center at 37 Gyedong-gil. They have free maps and guide books in English. The views from the hill tops highlight the contrast between the traditional homes and city life and are worth the climb."
"A traditional, picturesque oasis from chaotic modern Seoul","In a city like Seoul that has rapidly modernized, it was nice to find the traditional hanok area of Samcheong-Dong as a sort of peaceful getaway, right within throwing distance of Insa-dong and Gyeongbukgung. The traditional architecture is beautiful and has been well-restored and you'll find all sorts of small, quirky cafe's and galleries along the way - make sure you stop in to them, its half the experience. Unlike a lot of other Hanok villages in/around Seoul, people actually live in Samcheong-Dong, so take the opportunity to tour one of these houses and you really get a feel for pre high-rise Seoul. Even if you just want to join the others wandering around the narrow streets, its a great way to spend the afternoon. Here's a tip. You can get a samcheong-dong specific map at the KTO information booth at the end of Insa-Dong and they can chart out a route for you before you walk down."
Arty Street with Cool Cafes and Interesting Shops,The shops and restaurants were lovely and charming.The walk from the station to Samcheong-Dong was a little long though.
Put this in the bottom half of your list of places to visit,"Many private homes, some art galleries, some studios that teach traditional handicrafts like knot tying, sewing...near the main road that cuts thru the village are places to eat, tea, coffee. As you wander the narrow lanes in the interior of the village, we did not see that much. Lanes are lined with walls, gates are closed to the private homes, could not see anyone's front yard or the front of their houses. Gates to the studios were open, class hours and fees posted on/near the front gates...did not enter any of these areas...presume these are in-home studios. To be fair, we did not walk all thru the village, but we did see parts on both sides of the main road and we started our visit at the tourist center. It has a quiet neighborhood feel to it...also an artsy type of atmosphere due to the galleries, coffee/tea houses, small cafes."
Great place to wander,On a recent business trip I spent two afternoons walking the alleyways. Great little shops and many many restaurants. You really feel like you've gone back in time and are far away from the big city atmosphere of Seoul.A short cab ride from major hotels.
Favorite area of Seoul,I love this area of Seoul mainly for the traditional homes mixed with the cafes and small shops. Being an artist it is a great place to explore due to the various galleries. Also not a very crowded area since it is a bit out of the way having no subway near. I feel though it makes a great escape from the usual overcrowding of many areas of Seoul. If you don't really a have good sense of direction you can get lost through all the completely random alleys and roads.I make it a point to visit this area ever time I return to Korea especially to visit one of the coffee shops. But that is for another review.
I'm a local and I frequent this place often-that's how much I love it.,Samcheong dong is a quaint neighbourhood just east of Gyeongbokgung palace. It's filled with small cafes and restaurants; art galleries and museums as well as boutiques. Here you may also find some colourful murals and interesting art installations. You can walk through Samcheong dong en route to the Bukchon traditonal Hanok village which is very close by and a great way to experience some Korean culture and history.Have a look at my travel blog post about it. I'll be happy to answer your questions about it.http://koreantravels.wordpress.com/2010/12/01/the-splendors-of-samcheongdong-road/
Quaint,"It a fusion of the old and new. It's an interesting mix of shops and cafes. I ate very delicious waffle at Beans Bins. All in all, I can say, it was worth the trip."
My idea of a modern Korean town,"In Seoul for a business trip, got lost in Samcheong dok looking for the public bath mentioned in Lonely Planet - thoroughly enjoyed the 2 hour walk!. Treelined avenues that turn off into quaint shops, a little Japanese / Korean-ified Ubud. One of a kind local boutiques and cafes which are quiet and civilised and true blue local eating. no signs in English here! My most authentic experience thus far"
Nice way back to the history of Seoul,"Bukchon Hanok Village is placed in the area between two old palaces in north Seoul, Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung. This is a kind of an 'old town' of Seoul, although there are some other villages of the similar kind – some of which are inside Seoul metropolitan area, while the others are outside the city. Bukchon site is easily reached from Anguk subway station (Line 3, Exit 3). You can start your exploring by visiting Bukchon Traditional Culture Center at first (a kind of an audio-visual information office), where you can get basic information about the history of that part of Seoul and traditional Korean building crafts. In the Center you can see various posters-pictures with textual explanations and watch some video clips. In addition, there you can get a copy of information brochures. In opposite to the old palaces in Seoul, visiting the Bukchon Hanok village as a whole community is free, although there are paid tickets for some particular museums within the same area.I did not plan enough time for visiting these museums (I just passed by some of them), but I did enter one of the protected 'guest houses' in order to see its interior. A woman who lives in the house was not much fluent in English, so she was not capable to show me the whole house and describe more details related to the style of living in a traditional housing called 'hanok'. (The visitors are invited to enter some of the 'hanok' buildings, in order to see their interiors. Be prepared to take off your shoes or boots before going inside a traditional house.). I also saw the Hanok house in which one of the first hospitals was established and long ago.After spending some two hours by walking through the narrow streets of Bukchon area, I visited a pottery gallery and academy (called Yido or something like that), where I saw much artistic Korean tableware and bought a small vase (30 Euros), in order to remember the visit. The staff of the gallery's shop was kind enough to present me a small gift in shape of a bathroom soap stand. That was a nice gesture.Just before I left the Bukchon area, I spotted an 'organic food' shop down the street, where I bought a couple of snack packages, around 2000-3000 won each. Later I was sorry for not purchasing much more, because such 'healthy' articles I did not find in the shops of Myeong-dong where I was accommodated during my stay in Korea's capital. In addition, I found similar food much more expensive at Incheon Airport's duty free shops.As said, I entered the area by using the subway up to Anguk station (the same station I used the day before when visited the Jongmyo shrine). When finished my visit to Bukchon, I discovered that close to an another exit of the Anguk station was the 'upper' end of Insadong-il, the main pedestrian street of Insa-dong, the artistic soul district of Seoul. Therefore, I walked through it until I reached the 'lower' end of the street, followed by a 10-15-minute additional walk to Ibis Ambassador Hotel. That means, if you are not in a hurry and if the weather conditions are not bad, you can skip additional subway rides and take continuing walk by visiting several things in a row, one after the other, before you finish your daily route.If I planned another visit to the Bukchon village, I would reserve at least half a day for it alone and would try to enter more 'guest houses' as well as local museums, in order to get more feel about the life of the old Koreans."
Work through sweet & old in Central seoul,"This is my best place to go. Samcheong-dong gil(road) is a sweet and old are in Seoul, especially central Seoul. I go there after work or weekend then can make the rest of my day feel cozy. It is best to start the promenade from Pungmoon Girls' High School. It is near the No. 1 exit of Anguk subway station.Stroll along the stone walls, and by the time you reach Jeongdok Public Library, petit shops, art galleries, delicate cafes and restaurants will start to peek out.I did not take an any pic of samcheong-dong gil, but you should see and go there.below link is Korean official tour site about the road. take a look http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SH/SH_EN_7_4.jsp?cid=561239"
