Chic area,Loved this Korean neighborhood with its cool clothing stores and trendy restaurants.As shopping is the main attraction souvenir hunting is a must.
Buy souvenirs here!,"This is where we bought our souvenirs, after walking one whole day. Luckily there is a halal Indian restaurant here. Worth a visit!"
Trendy,"Insa-dong is a lovely trendy place to go , we went there 2 day in a roll , it’s got it unique feel about it , and lots of good restaurant on the side alley way , and lots of shopping around here , "
Street Walk,"Walked along the street to get to Kimchi Museum. There are many tea-houses and nice home-style korean restaurants along this street. Plenty of eats but all appear pretty similar in terms of food options offered. If you are not into local fare, suggest you venture elsewhere such as Itaewon or even Gangnam areas for more international fare."
Cultural Hub,"We enjoyed a nice stroll here. The art galleries and handicraft shops were definitely worth a visit. And the cafes here... each one offers a unique experience, but the most memorable for us was the matcha cafe! We’d like to come back and spend more time here. "
Vibrant tourist spot,"We took almost an hour of train from Gangnam's Handuk station to Anguk station. Took the exit 6 and Insadong's main street is just 200 meters away. The street is filled with restaurants local and international, shops selling souvenirs, cafes, tea house, etc. In the heart of it is a building called Ssamziegil with its spiralling floors. You may want to pay the Ddong cafe aka poop cafe a visit.The main street will be branched out to many gil (Lane) in Korean. In those gils you will find mainly restaurants. Few of the popular ones we visited are in 12gil (bbq),8gil (sujebi noodle), 9gil (dumplings) .It's gets livelier during the evening around 6pm to 9pm. Overall this is a place where you wouldn't want to miss when visiting Seoul. "
Easy stroll around local & traditional shoos,"Streets are full of a mixture of local, traditional & modern shops. The main street is shut to vehicles so it's an easy wander, with lots of side streets off. Take time to look in to all the side areas. Easy access if staying in Insadong or easy access from subway at Anguk or Jong Gak stations "
Don't miss this area if you enjoy market shopping,"While I enjoyed other Seoul markets, Insadong was where I found hand dyed silk apparel and Korean crafted items. The other ""made in China"" souvenirs are here as well, but if you search,you can find gems among the shops."
Food and shops ,"It's a nice place to find good korean food. It has these small alleys where you can explore and find restaurants. There are also tons of shops selling variety of cute stuff and souvenirs. Don't miss out on trying the famous ""poop "" pancakes when you're here."
Art street of Korea,So many interesting shops and art cafes. We wish we had more time to explore and look into the crafts and souvenirs. They are just quiet pricey but worth it.
Many souvenirs in here!,"Worth to come. Because many variety of souvenirs in here. Price not so expensive,, i recommend this store in pic, because she gave us so many bonus for my kids haha"
Seoul's Artistic Town! ,"Insadong is definitely a must visit place in Seoul. Walk along the lively streets filled with art gallery, handicrafts shops, dragon candy stalls, street musician, artsy cafes and more! "
Souvenir,This place is a place to buy souvenir where you also can find unique mall called ssamziegil. Best to go is in weekend noon to evening. 
Nice tea alley,"Nice street with ceramic products of tea pots/cups and local souvenirs. Plenty of restaurants, they even offered English menu. There is a nice tiny tea museum off the path. Their tea are medicinal so ingest wisely. If you never had traditional tea before, safer to try in small sips. My friend inhaled hers within minutes and was nauseated a short while later. Getting here by taxi can be a pain because traffic here is bumper to bumper at most times of the day. Subway is much faster and cheaper. "
Touristy,Mostly souvenir shops with a few small art galleries here and there. Made for a good walk nevertheless.
Nice,"The area is interesting, full of restaurants to choose from. Many shops and souvenirs to buy. Good for a day to shop and eat."
Nice and thats all,"Nice for 30 minutes and thats all. Not so interesting, there are more better streets market in seoul"
feel the art while drinking your tea,"I have visited insadong 10 years ago. Not changed too much. I ma impressed beacue of small art shop where the artist inside and going on create nrew picture, porcelein, wooden. there are lots of tea / coffe shops. there only one toilet at the basement on Ssazling basement. "
Culture meets tourism,"Insa-Dong is a place where you could go to old Tea houses or into kinda moderns shopping malls. YOu can find a lot of old papers, masks and tea pots here to buy. "
Convenient location for all your souvenir needs,"Only visited the top part of Insadong-gil where all the souvenir shops were. Very convenient for your souvenir needs with lots of shops for all types of goods, and in walking distance from Gyeonbukgong and Changdeokgung palaces and Bukchon Hanok village. Also, just down the alleyways are some nice local restaurants for lunch or dinner after shopping."
pedestrian boutique + souvenir road,"Great at first glance, touristic at second. Some nicely designes clothes - many repetitive souvenirs. My hotel was near there + the street + side streets have many restaurants."
Typical Shopping Street,There are a lot of good stores and restaurants here. Mix of tourist shops and some art shops. There was this cool building about half way down that had many floor with individual shops that sold handmade crafts. They also had a couple 10 Won bag shops. Picked up some fun purses and a new backpack to use. 
Convenient area,"We traveled to Seoul and we couldn’t find better area than Insadong. Here you can walk and visit the best palaces, villages and more, you can also shop and have a great meals.Definitely convenient area with good transport connectivity bus and subway."
Shops and eat ,Interesting area full of shops and restaurants. You can find normal gift items to rare find art items. Go through the little alleys and find some of the best restaurants. 
Where you would buy everything you are....,"This is the kind of place where you like anything you see.... Where you want to get everything back home with you...Pottery, wood works, local craft, clothes, art, food...amazing "
Great cultural district,"Great place to look for arts and cultural trinkets or souvenirs such as traditional paintings,fabrics, hanboks, tea accessories, painting accessories, etc. "
Very entertaining,"I enjoyed visiting the numerous shops repeat with local handicrafts. The people were very pleasant. I enjoyed strolling around shopping and taking photos and also found many tasty treats to sample. plus there was a Starbucks and I was in need of a coffee, so I had a really good time. Oh, and I bought numerous gifts to take home to friends."
Great trip,"Great transit network, very efficient and on time. I need tp write 100 characters but i dont need them...."
Overrated Tourist Area,The main street has been closed to allow pedestrians to walk the entire length. It is pleasant enough but a great disappointment as many tourist guides raise expectations beyond what is warranted. 
Nice Change From Shopping Centers,Little shops line the alleys and they were fun to venture. Do note this is touristy area so prices are also high. There are interesting shops and tea houses along the way that offer a respite from the heat ( we were there in summer ) and walking.
Nice area with great cafes,"Some beautiful cafes here, and lots of options for Jujube tea. A bit touristy and gets quieter around 9-10pm, but very vibrant during the day and early evening."
Shopping ,"Interesting place to visit but not on hot day. No cover except into those tiny shops- do drop into a few interesting shops esp the Michelin Traditional teahouse on Insadong. Great place to have korean tea, coffee, snacks and lots of photos "
Food and shops,Insa-dong is a street close to the royal palaces. It is a touristy area and the prices are accordingly. A good range of places to eat can be found in the alleyways of the main street. There are also a number of bars in the alleys.
Nice cultural/shopping area,Insadong has a lot of arts and cultural places. The main street is primarily for shopping so venture off it for hidden gems!
Food and Shopping ,"Insadong is near Bukchon Hanok Village. It is a whole street filled with food and Shopping, they sell traditional souvenirs and art pieces! It is recommended for people who have an appreciation for arts or are looking to buy traditional souvenirs back home. "
Typical shopping street,Lots of places to eat and buy things. However the prices are not cheap as it is a touristy area. We didn't stop long in any of the shops as we were only walking past on the way back to the hotel. Good to spend a hour perhaps.
"Interesting, original street.","Here you can find everything related to art and folk crafts: souvenirs, paintings, handicrafts. Many galleries, small shops. Very atmospheric place! On weekends (and maybe not only), many different master classes for children and adults are held."
The touristy shopping district,"This is a kind of place a lot of day tours bring tourists to shop. It's nice, walkable, colorful and safe. Plenty of shops and places to eat."
Souvenirs for Tourists,"Insadong is one of the must visits in Seoul. There are different kinds of food sold along the street. What I like about Insadong is that there are different kinds of souvenir items, arts and crafts, jewelries and local artists' creations here. Some items are not cheap but if you find one that you really like, better buy it if you think you can't find one like that for a cheaper price. You can do a half day or few hours visit here, depending on your interests. It's also near some of the tourist spots. You'll see a lot of tourists walking wearing the hanbok."
Little foodie heaven,Here is one of the places you can try traditional foods while taking in scenic ambiance of modern and old-world charms combined. Plenty of shops selling tasty delicacies and souvenirs that reflect the old and new Korea. 
Nice place to explore,"I was not sure what this place has to offer. But when we visited this place, there were so many interesting places to see....shopping and restaurants mostly. I like this place because it offered so many things. I wish I had so much time to explore this place. Maybe on my next visit. Who knows? "
"Cultural heaven, souvenir central","I recommend to come here if you need to buy some cultural souvenirs. They are all cheap and have good quality. If you go, check out the handmade stuff as well inside the mall looking place."
Great for shopping,"You can buy there gifts, souvenirs, you can also have a snack or just stroll around looking at the colorful crowd of locals and foreigners. Easy to get there from metro station - for example Anguk (Line 3) or Jonggak (Line 1). My hidden gem was O'Sulloc Tea House."
Great for Souvenirs and Eating,Souvenir shopping here is great and there are many alleys with a wide choice of restaurants with English language menus.
Must go to buy gifts and souvenirs ,"It is a hustling street, full of shops for gifts and souvenirs. There are many shops of Korean cosmetics which are top quality. You can buy many Korean masks by a very good price. Also there are good prices Korean restaurants. This street is very close to the palace (walking distance). "
"Quirky, artsy and quaint ","Stumbled across this gorgeous little village that I’d read about but not realised how quaint and quirky it really was! Loved it! Fantastic place for kids to create their own slime, arty pictures, candles etc! "
Good food and shopping options ,Insadong is a great neighborhood in Seoul for travelers to visit. There are good restaurants everywhere and many are not expensive. There’s also heaps of souvenirs for sale so it’s a great spot for travelers to visit! 
Traditional snacks and souvenirs,Went to Insadong shopping street for lunch. It offers many traditional Korean snacks and souvenirs. Managed to find a really nice tea house that sends you back in time with it's rustic and cosy environment.
Restaurants Expensive and Not Delicious Food,"To me, this is an area that doesn't worth revisiting. Restaurants are expensive but not yummy at all. The shopping centre is not fabulous either. It's a quieter and more traditional area. Visiting once is enough. "
Good Place to Buy Souvenirs,"A nice selection of souvenir stores, so worth the visit for that alone. At least on the main street, more of a quaint souvenir/tourist street rather than the neighborhood feel I was expecting, but we enjoyed being able to get all of our gifts in one place."
Great food on side streets,"Great little side streets with amazing restaurants! Neat area for shopping and great food. Very near Gyeongbokgung palace. We went there to find a place for lunch. Watch out for guys asking for donations, they tend to target the tourist, but are not aggressive, just tell them no.There are some neat shops."
Shopping district,You can find a lot of shops and Restaurants. Also some street food. Interesting is also a temple at this district
Great place for a walk,"Our hotel was close to Insadong and we really enjoyed visiting many times during our stay. The restaurants were very good, our favorite tea shop MoonBird Only thinks of the Moon was there and many very nice shops."
Con un pie roto por un templo budista...,As like all Asia the contrasting arquitecture from the temple and the modern buildings give you the taste of the modern Seoul with ancient traditions.Frivolous shopping and a mystical stop to observe the lotos ....
Fun souvenir street,"Located in easily walkable distance between the palaces and Myeongdong, this small area should be visited for cheap souvenirs, also must visit the fun mini shopping arcade called Ssamziegil."
Good pedestrian street to stroll,Good place to buy souvenirs with many restautants (incl. fantastic vegan ones) great cafes ans tea houses. Close to many other touristic spots. 
Enjoyable walk,"Love to walk Insadong gil. It is not quite a pedestrian only as there are delivery vehicles and taxis passing thru during the day, but pure pedestrian after a certain hour in the afternoon. It is very crowded but still enjoyable to walk thru and experience the many shops, restaurants and gift shops. Be sure to walk the many side alleyways, which are filled with restaurants and shops. It is very safe. Most of Insadong gil is smoke free another good feature. And eventhough some areas are cobblestone, it is pretty much flat and straight for wheelchair accessiblity."
Cuuuute,A series of old school fashioned shops and tea/coffee houses. Certainly worth a look. Had a fantastic relaxed time at a tea house there. 
Good spot for insta.,"Originally there were many of traditional shops and tea cafes prviously but it turned morden style a lot but still many things to see and take a picture for insta. In the small alleys there are old resturants what you can enjoy Korean traditional food not only Bulgoggies but also Korean rice wine. You can reach on foot from Kyungbok palace, Changkyung palace, Hanok village, Jongro and so on. You can walk 10,000 steps easily."
Korean Ice Cream,"If it’s hot this is an awesome place to cool down, with a shared bowl of shaved ice cream with condensed milk you can pour over that really brings out the taste of the shaved ice whether you start with chocolate or mango or any of the other multitude of flavours. "
Absolutely stunning!,"Definitely one of my favorite places in Seoul! You can definitely feel the traditional and cultural atmosphere here. Lots and lots of souvenirs for you to choose from ranging from affordable to slightly pricey. Also, tons of unique, handmade stuffs you can buy to bring home. The entire street are long with tons of shops, restaurants, and coffee shops so you can definitely take your time here and just explore, perhaps, a whole day here would be good to just hang out and chill too!I came here multiple times during my trip because of the vibes, the food are awesome too, very traditional mixed with modern! Just remember to wear comfy shoes :) Once you're done with the main street, you can also walk around the area which has plenty of sightseeing with traditional shops, temples, etc."
Lively Part of Seoul,"Realky nice area in downtown Seoul with loads of eateries, sone good bars, hotels and souvenir shops. Within easy walk of the two main palaces. The Airport bus stops here and its served by the subway.I stayed in Insadong and really enjoyed it, the place has a good vibe."
Nice shopping street,"We enjoyed this street as it had different shops (art, furniture) that we did not see in other parts of the city. I bought a greta painting and amazing Korean lamp there.It had greta options for food and snacks as well.I strongly recommend the restaurant ""So Sim"""
Interesting place in the city,The town has different look from Seoul which has tall building forest and is crowded. The town has lots of low ceiling stores. You can see Korean traditional goodies or restaurants in the town. It’s an interesting place. Prices seem a bit overpriced through.
Great shopping and food experience,This is a place to visit for higher end gift items. There are shops that sell traditional celadon pottery that make perfect gift that is unique to Korea. Street and alley ways are adorned with traditional Korean style buildings that enhances your overall experience. Recommend visiting after the Gyeoungbokgung place because it is located two blocks South East.
Great area ,"It is an amazing area, nice, clean, friendly, lots of things to see and do, bars, restaurants, hotels, locals and many foreigners to chat with. A lot of hidden and cute street to walk around and feel the Korean atmosphere. "
Souvenir shopping,"this is the only place i saw in Seoul that was selling souvenirs in abundance. I mean there were other places and well, but this has dedicated shops for your magnets, chopsticks, handicraft etc. They also have some alleys which have some authentic korean restaurants - worth a visit. Very clean place"
A fun mixture of tradition and modern..,"We were just strolling around the area for some food and a Korean friend recommended this old but nice small restaurant which serves korean traditional snacks..There are traditional items sold in the stores like antique stuffs or wood carvings..You can also buy souvenirs at a low cost, you can make bargains if you buy more..There are also modern pubs and restaurants in the area.What I didn't like is that people are smoking every alley. I hate the smell of cigars.But overall, the place is a good stroll. Interesting stuff, delicious food and lively community."
My favorite part of Seoul ,If you’re an artist or crafts person this is the place to go. Great food and lots of great shops with beautiful artists and offerings. Don’t miss it!!
Pedestrian street ,Pedestrian street with many shops. Buyins souvenirs or art pieces is possible. Did not see any coffee shops to sit and look around.
Nice area,"Nice area. There are lots to see, eat and shop. You can rent traditional Korean costume and walk around"
Great food and atmosphere,Worth a visit if you want to sample Korean food and traditional street food. There are also several bars and modern western restaurants. I saw a lot of young people in the streets.
Seoul’s art center,"We always come by as our friend own a shop, Shin Young Mi, selling art pieces - paintings, ties, scarves and umbrellas. There are many shops with products from local artists. Bought some embroidery souvenirs. I found an Osulloc tea house here."
Great spot for long layover ,"I visited Insadong during a long layover and had a great time. A lot of restaurants, cafes and shops for souvenirs and gifts."
Nice street,"I had been in the noon and it was plenty of people, I got news that in the night is crowded of local and turist people in shopping or dining time. It is a good place for visit in you stay in this area."
Korean souvenirs,"Buying Korean souvenirs here is way cheaper than in other places. They also have a store here where all bags are 10,000won/each. We also found a ""mom & pop"" shop that serves good army stew. A must place to visit for shoppers"
Beautiful artsy area,"Twice I have lived in this area and I really love it - the wonderful souvenir shops, the galleries and of course the food places. Truly love this area."
traditional souvenir,"Lots of artsy and traditional souvenirs can be found here, but there are also kpop merchandise. There are many art galleries but i never went into one. The souvenirs are a bit expensive though."
Beautiful area,"I like it here as I am into culture. Beautiful lanes with beautiful structure. It was a nice stroll going down the lanes. Saw some tourist dressed up in the traditional outfits, beautiful indeed. Spent sometimes browsing the souvenirs shops. I truly enjoyed this place."
Good place for art & food,"After touring Bukchon Hanok Village, we walked over to Insadong for lunch. There is a main pedestrianised street and side alleys branching out by the side.We stopped by at a small eatery for cold noodles and mandus (Korean dumplings). After lunch we were directed by a man holding a menu card to visit a Hanok house in the side alley for dessert.There are a number of galleries, art and craft shops. I had a caricature drawn by a street artist in Ssamzigil. It was a fun place to be after visiting Gyeongbokgung and Bukchon."
Too many palaces in one day?,"This area near Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces is the perfect area to stroll when one more palace is just too much. There are small boutiques, cafes and street vendors to entice you to part with your remaining won -- or just stroll and watch other tourists spend theirs!"
too touristic,It has became too touristic after all the tourist visit here. It is not special unless you want to shop something for gift. 
Heart of the City,"The streets and narrow alleyways have art galleries, teahouses, restaurants and cafes, small shops selling arts and crafts and there are lots of souvenirs and lots of people. But if you do wander down the alleyways you can find little places to poke in to. I found a hole in the wall place making only mandu which are the Korean dumplings. Also followed the tracks up to one of the cat cafes. It's just a great time to wander and browse and see where your eyes, ears and nose will take you."
Holiday,"We visited Bukchon village and after we walked to Insa-dong. There is a wide street with alleyways coming off the main drag. There are lots of craft and art outlets mixed with cafes and restaurants. There is not the hustle and bustle of some other areas which makes it pleasant to stroll, look and enjoy. A great pocket of Seoul. There were very interesting shops selling hand made fans and good souvenirs locally made. "
Lovely Art Village,"A quiet place to leisurely stroll among arts and stores selling local handmade items, plenty of street food, restaurants, coffee shops and music. Money changer across Starbucks, a tourist Information at one end A clean and beautiful cobblestone street conveniently located between 2 palaces – Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changgyeonggung Palace. Plenty of benches to rest. Also in Insadong you can rent a Hanbok, Korea’s National Costume to wear to the palace for perfect pictures! Very easy to hail a taxi."
Shopping for Souvenirs,I found some good items for souvenirs and gifts to friends. But I have a hard time looking for men's clothing and accessories. Enjoyed the walk with the cool breezy air.
great,"fantastic place to stroll and wander around,buying souvenirs for home. Even a cat cafe with little munchkin cats!"
"Nice area, all you need","Lots of boutique and artisan type shops as well as lower end souvenir shops further down the stretch, but the whole area is pretty clean and has a nice calm vibe about it despite being a busy/touristy area. You can stroll down the main street taking in all they have to offer while drinking your fresh strawberry juice and eating whatever you may find among the many options of street food (not for me - i quickly found spice allergy is a bit of an issue in korea!). At the bottom of the road there's loads of old guys at tables outside the edge of the park playing board games and at the top of the road you pretty much have gyeongbokgung palace, a nice contrast. The presence of the traditional korean spa here is reason enough alone to go to insadong, it's a bonus that it's a great area with so much else to offer too."
Cozy place for shopping and eating ..,"A cozy place for a walk, shopping and eating. Not super crowded than the other market, more organize, interesting design of street (you need to explore the places in the aisle - you will be surprise on small and tasty restaurant that serve Korean food and snacks)and lot of choices.Also if you want to have a photo session with hanbok and other traditional dress you can fine one place, very profesional one just on the main street of Insadong market. "
Shady avenue,I'm finding the more areas I visit in Seoul that they are all basically the same Mind you this has some lovely shady trees down this street which make it pleasant. There is one particular shop where the guys are making a product from honey and malt and filling it with nutty mixture which is delicious. You can see them making them - nice guys too!
Interesting tourist spot,"Many lanes and shops, so can be confusing if you dont hv good sense of direction. But a place worth visiting. Opposite one of the lanes is the Joygesa temple decorated with many colourful lantherns in celebration of Vesak Day."
"A lovely, arty part of town",We came here as part of the Busan City tour and decided to come back again the next day to spend more time in this lovely area. The shops are just that bit more unusual than those we visited elsewhere and we particularly liked the antique shops.
Traditional small town,"Very art centric and traditional in that no store signage can be in English, see Starbuck's photo. Nice area to walk and browse, there's even an alley with antiques. "
Nice but not entirely novel,"We lived in Insadong during our trip - which made it super convenient for quick meals, sundries and shopping for knickknacks. The main shopping street branches into lanes with teashops, restaurants and crafts shops. "
"Getting more tourist oriented by the year, but I still always find something extraordinary.","I have been back to Insadong several times over the last several years. Over the past three visits I have seen more of the galleries and fine art places disappear and more places selling tourist stuff. Still there are places with beautiful art and crafts. I found a Chinese style teapot in a cream glaze with fabulous grey craqueleur. It was not cheap but it is not something you are likely to find anywhere else. Every time I have come here and wandered the streets, I have found something unique. So it is still worth visiting, tourists and all. There are any number of tea and coffee places, traditional Korean restaurants, and, if your are vegetarian, one famous vegan place specialising in Korean temple food, Sanchon. I do plan to return next visit."
Insanely Touristy,"I’m not sure what we expected, but this tourist-street wasn’t it. We did have a decent lunch in a side alley off the main drag, but the whole area just felt a bit fake and touristy. Possibly not, but the rest of the week in Seoul, we barely met any non-domestic tourists, and Insadong just felt a bit like a Western tourist hub. There are far nicer to see Korean traditions than here."
Love the neighborhood,"It was so pleasant walking around every street. So many restaurants and shops everywhere. It's not as crowded as Myeongdong and prices are much better as well. Nice, quaint shops and food was really good. "
Nice walk,Walked through this area after a visit to some nearby shrines. Some good tourist shops and galleries. Enjoyable and worth a look
Almost a step back in time ,"This was right behind our hotel. There are many shops, resturants, tea houses and more. There was almost too many options to eat. We found food stalls and a lot of traditional resturants slightly off the beayen path. Not to mention the galleries and museums. "
Fascinating area to spend time exploring,"As I was staying right near Insadong, I had the area on my doorstep. There are hundreds of restaurants of varying quality and price. Generally, I've found dining out in Seoul to be quite expensive but it is possible to find cheaper meals if you're prepared to overcome the lack of language and give the food a go! It's delicious! There are some great shops in Insadong, though a bit touristy for my taste, so I didn't actually buy anything. Insadong can get very busy on Friday and Saturday nights, but that adds to its charm. "
"Tourist area, with plenty of shops",Walk past here by accident. There are plenty of individual shops for gifts. However I would definite bargain. As majority of the time only tourist come over here. The area is quite atmospheric. Worth a walk around.
A really great souvenir shopping street,"Well, you know how these places usually are. Same things over and over, with prices varying two-fold. Stuff made in China... You know what I'm talking about. All this can be found here, BUT to much less extent than you would usually see. Quite a few unique hand-made artifacts, lots of ""art galleries"" along the street and further to the sides. Quite reasonable prices as well. The must if you are after something local to bring back home."
Local shopping,"If you’re looking for a place to buy local souvenirs this is it. There are a bunch of local shops catered to locals more than tourists. There is also a buda temple near by. There is some street food too. Not far from the palace, it’s a short 5-10 minute walk."
"Nice area, and things to see and do!",You can shop many traditional Korean arts and crafts here. It was nice area to explored the culture and history of Korea.
Not especially interesting ,The main “antique “ street was little more than a tourist mall but the side streets with their rabbit warrens of buildings with numerous stalls were more interesting though the items for sale looked generally to be of mediocre quality 
Worth to see,"It is a bit atypical shopping area. It is a mix of art galleries, interesting shops, different type of restaurants."
Strolling through this artistic street in Seoul City,Insadong is an interesting area where artists sell their products. Also small shops with painting articles can be found there. Look in the side streets for nice small restaurants with good food.
Worth seeing,"It is not like typical 《shopping only》place. There are art galleries around, interesting shops, many restaurants in many types. It is worth the time."
This place is excellent,"A very wide variety of stores and market type stalls. Vist the Sword shop up a side alley - truely amazing array of hand made weaponary as seen in the movies, all made here. Everything to please the ladies."
The Place To Go For Souveniers,This is the best location for unique and pretty souvenirs. Be sure to also stop Nuri Kitchen for the best lunch box lunch ever!
Very crowd but worth to visit only once,Used to be one of the best place to visit but now is too crowd .However it is worthwhile to visit. Some good restaurants.Another nearby place to recommend is Ikson-dong
Nice Historical Street,Was there only around 30 mins but find this place is nice and plenty of picture taking which there is a lot of old shoplots with modern skyscraper behind them.Souvenirs are aplenty but didn't check the price as my time is limited here
Nice waling street wiht many restaurants and shopping hub,"A very nice walking street with lots of souvenir shops and several restaurant to try local specialties, some street food stalls also offer local specialties worth trying, the street is also near several other tourist attractions"
Plenty to see here lots to buy.Plenty of variety.,"It is popular but this is Korea and some. Lots of small shops selling all sorts. Plenty of craft, pper, writing materials, clothes, restaurants, coffee and tea houses. It is vibrant. Well worth a visit."
"Handmade Korean goods, but its industrialized.","Great location to buy gifts for tourists to bring back home.The prices are reasonable and you get the feeling for Korean made goods and its culture.There are places to eat along the beaten path. Its a quick walk and worth spending your time here in the evening before you go to get your gifts.Its not easy to find off the metro, as there are many exits to the street from below and depending which one you take you have to walk a bit to get to the district.The prices range from inexpensive to fairly expensive. Bring your wallet and walking shoes."
Love this area,"There is always something interesting to see or eat in this lovely part of Seoul. Easily accessible by metro and close to some of the more frequented Seoul attractions it should definitely be part of your travel plans. Lots of handmade crafts, pottery, textiles. Wonderful tea shops to enjoy a moment of rest and restaurants for a delicious meal. My favorite place to visit in Seoul and take guests when they visit. "
Another fun but touristy place to visit in city center Seoul,"Insadong has a few street food vendors (not much really), but lots of street and sidewalk merchandise vendors and small stores, and lots of restaurants. More good people watching. Definitely should be on your list."
Not very special,"This area is touted as a great place to go and buy artifacts. However it's more a clothes shopping places, I'd say, as the artifacts aren't all that special and look a bit fake (not handmade...)."
Shopping Spree,Pretty Street. Can easily spend a couple of hours here. Brands I’ve never seen. Got some “Chasing Stretch” tracksuit pants and “Jaju” sloppy joe and pearl hoop earrings from street vendor. Service was a bit icy but practical. Highly recommend. 
Quaint,Very interesting area located in Seoul in the streets that have cultural shops showing videos on how they made pots. Masks and jewellery. There are also shops selling hand made paper and all of the materials needed to write in Korean style with special types of brushes and inks which are really very interesting
Insadong,"If you are into arts, drop by to this beautiful row of shophouses. This is the place that we feel still keeps check their Korean heritage. Even the word, Starbucks is spelled in Hangul. Amazing. It is walking distance from Samcheongdong-gil though. So you can travel to 2 places on 1 trip. "
Half day Visit Including Lunch,"A must place to visit every time I visit Seoul. There are lots of visitors from all over the world there. They are selling all the typical tourist stuff (junk) one could expect. Really nice restaurant that have a lot of experiences serving foreigners from all over the globe. If no one speaks Korean, well the picture menu is fine. Just point to the item and say ok. Knives and forks are available at almost all restaurants in this area of Seoul. Enjoy your lunch or dinner!"
Nice Place,We spent a day in Insadong taking in the sights and wandering through the streets enjoying every minute here.
Charming Place for an Old Town,"I love the feel of this place...traditional and modern at the same time. It's a nice area to shop here as there are so many shops, souvenirs and cafes."
More of an artisan's street than a market,"We went there to eat and found there were multiple alleys and that each alley had several restaurants. We didn't know this and immediately chose a restaurant on the first alley we entered. We thought of buying trinkets from Insadong to bring home but because the shops on the main street are more of artisan shops showcasing handmade crafts. We waited till we got to Namdaemun market to buy cheap goods instead. (Stingy, I know. In my defense we bought in bulk so it wouldn't be cost effective for us to buy exclusive items.) "
Cute and Vibrant!,"A lovely place to stroll through looking for both locally made unusual and typical souvenirs. It's typically very much full of western, English speaking tourists, but many of the sellers and stall holders do not speak great English, so be prepared to have your translation book/app out - all park of the experience!If it's time for a meal, be sure to check out the streets and alleys that run off the sides of the main, as they offer great local and international foods at bargain prices!"
Nice place,Not cheap though but very nice place. Also family friendly. You can bring your kids and do shopping.
Touristy but Great Experience,"We visited the area and decided to check out the alleys (which had great food places) and purchased quite a few souvenirs from here. It was touristy, but it was still a great experience. We want to go back to the poop cafe."
Korea-all in.,"Awesome street. It’s a mixture of Korean culture and everything else. Shopping for traditional stuff and modern items for gifts or personal use. Locally made and imported items. Hanbok rentals, cafes and restaurants for all tastes. And, of course, the street food. Nice people there too. On 2 stores I bought some items in, they gave out some free stuff. Maybe I was just lucky, but ut did give me a good impression of the neighborhood. One can spend a whole day there. Also nice for people watching, specially at this time of year (spring)."
High energy; lots to see and do,"Insadong street was near our hotel so we walked it several times. Always something new to see, from restaurants to shops and galleries. "
Beautiful area with lots of young and older women in traditional costumes,"We experienced the hanbok rental (traditional clothing). Girls rent the traditional clothing at a cost of about $150US! They wear tennis shoes under the dresses and take phone photos of each other in various poses. The back of the head is often more photographed than the face, or so I saw. Shopping is good quality and pricing."
Walking around,There are a lot of traditional Korean souvenirs shops you can pick and should many choices also many restaurants around.
Charming street,Insadong is a charming street to walk through. Lots of artsy stores and souvenir shops. Small eateries give you great food choices.

Cute Area!! ,"Loved this shopping area. Most of the stores don’t open until 1030/11 am and most of the stores close around 8 pm. Around 530 some street vendors came out on the end of the street with delicious snacks. We had heard about a fish shaped ice cone from a friend that was a must try and found it here. It was delicious, but very sweet. "
Tea houses an souvenir ,This is a great place to take a break for the day at a tea house and then get some shopping in as well!! 
Nice area,"The area is pretty nice, not just Insadong but the surrounding area within 15 minutes walk radius. Recommend a visit when in Seoul."
Very quite.,Visited on a Friday from about 5pm to 8pm. It was extremely quite and slow. Not sure if it would be better to visit during the day but for me it was not terribly interesting. Enjoyed other areas of Seoul much more.

Saturday in Seoul,I have been going to Insadong whenever I can get a chance when in Seoul as I love this place. It show cases Korean traditional art but also various traditional food selections are very nice. I am an artsy person and I enjoy looking at Korean folk arts and purchasing gifts from here more than anywhere else. I highly recommend people visit Insadong at least once if you are in Seoul.
Local market,"Local market! a lot of interesting places with souvenirs and street food! If you like such things, it is worth going to this place and checking it yourself! For us, it was just ok! Quite a lot of people"

Hidden Secrets,"This section of Seoul is a place I love to get lost within. Don’t be scared of taking the winding narrow roads because they often lead to hidden treasures, like traditional tea shops, unique galleries, and cozy alcohol joints. Great with a first date, solo, or family. - this area even has a St. Patrick’s Day outdoor party with live music. Lots of street vendors. I mostly go for the desserts. Modern mixed with traditional styles. Great place to buy souvenirs, especially scroll paintings."
A piece of older town,"Not very far form the royal palace and national museum, definitely worth visiting. Especially if you want to see something different than glass, steel and concrete. Touristy. Restaurants, souvenir shops, galleries, street food etc"

San Antonio riverwalk but set in Seoul,Great area for tourists - lots of restaurants and shops - and everyone speaks at least functional English - you will see lots of USA tourists because of location near US base - so of course the local merchants responded to the local demand 
A nice area to walk around,"Insadong is a small area which is significantly less crowded than MyeongDong. We came here because our hostel was closeby and we really appreciated the tea shop there. You can get all sorts of really nice matcha teas and desserts~!The insadong area is also good for getting little souvenirs which we found to be actually quite difficult to find in other areas! You can find lots of tea ceremony places in this area, so definitely worth a stroll about, especially to get away from the hustle and bustle of other areas."
"Small street, high price but lovely","It small walking street but have a lot of remarkable places. The prices in here are quite expensive, just go and see, no need to buy anything"
Shopping and cafes ,Loads of local shops selling handmade local goods and mass produced cheap touristy stuff. Many cafes and restaurants. Lots to keep you busy. 
Perfect for those take home souvenirs,There are lots of nice shops with handmade items and a few restaurants but definitely the place to come for cheap trinkets to take home for friends and family.

interesting walk,"I have been there twice. In the summer, it is very crowed, populated by local visitors, which means it is not a place for tourists. A few days ago, it was less crowded but still interesting even though one can see a lot of shops selling cheap products.There is a very interesting restaurant in the area called Sanchon worth eating there. It is presented as eating monastery food. It is very spectacular, plentiful, and the service is excellent."

"Souvenirs and Street Food, Oh My!","It likely goes without saying that Insa-dong is a tourist's paradise--but, oddly enough, not really in a bad way. There are loads of inexpensive, cute souvenirs, but if you look around long enough you'll also find genuine quality goods for not too terribly much. Many of the shops sell the same basic souvenirs--bookmarks, chopsticks, small silky bags--so don't worry about shopping around too much. Antiques, ceramics, and paintings can all be found as well, albeit for a higher price point than the 1000 won postcards!"
Nice craft area of Seoul,Loads of high-quality goods to view and purchase. The masks were especially well done. Nice walkable area close to the subway.
Souvenir paradise,"This is the place for souvenir shopping. A small street that is less crowded than the main markets, there are numerous shops selling souvenirs. There are also little arts and crafts shops. If arts and crafts, you will be in paradise. While there, we ate at the Indian restaurant Nirvana, which was excellent. "
Best place to go shopping and street foods.,This place is a walking distance from our hotel and every night I’ve walked around to this street to buy street food. It’s also the street where you can find bargains. There’s also a restaurant on that street that specialize a braised beef ribs that it’s so delicious. We ate at the restaurant 4 times and ordered the same thing all the time.
Beautiful area of Seoul,A great place to pick up souvenirs and to take pictures. Make sure to check out Ssamzigil for more aunthetic souvenirs and art! 
Great place,"Fantastic place that is reminiscent of a sleepy mediterranean village. Wonderful shops, museum, galleries, and cafes."

Less tourists ,"If you want a quiet place to shop minus the crowd, we find Insadong is a good choice. Also sufficient restaurants around to satisfy your empty stomach too. "
Limited shopping,"Mostly souvenir shops with restaurants and coffee shops in between. If you’re looking for more shops with a wide variety of merchandise and tax-free goods, better go to Myeongdong."
Nothing spectacular ,"An old shopping street with lots of shopping snd street food stall. One place with multi storey open air building is unique and attract lots of youngster to hang around. Lots of artistic work like handicraft , clothing etc.. "
Shopping place for the Korean things,"It is a must visit place if you are in Seoul where you will find all the traditional things of Korea which includes souvenirs, food, clothes, and what not. It is a free walk area with full lighting and you can enjoy the whole atmosphere whether you shop or not. You won’t come empty handed if you are there. Thx "
Quaint and Charming artsy zone,Cool to explore the art galleries and museums ... street stalls selling handicrafts were really awesome too
A magical place,My family and I love Insadong! Check out any little side street and get swept away in to a magical place. Calitacos is a 10/10! Everything was delicious. English speakers as well.
Quaint shopping area ,Nice tea houses to keep warm in winter months. Lots of knick knacks and arts and crafts to look at and buy. A good place to spend a couple of hours to soak in the artsy side of Seoul. 
"You should explore the little lanes and alley ways and you will find many of these eateries,","We can here on a late morning and took a walk around this area. There are quite a few shops selling art pieces and these are really quite nice. Of course, there are many souvenir shops and eateries, the latter of which you should explore the little lanes and alley ways and you will find many of these eateries, some of which are packed. The mall Ssamzigil is Aldo worth a visit, as it is made up of many stores selling very unique items. "
Insadong area,"Just walk, don't go by bus. I and my daughter walked about 15 minutes from Myeongdong market, and surprised I saw river garden, wow... its beautiful."
So many things to do,"Where to start? So many little shops, tea houses, restaurants to choose from. You can pass half a day there, play in the labyrinth, practice your baseball swing at the batting range, enjoy the free shows on the weekends but don't forget to visit those small streets, so many treasures to be found there."
Quaint area,"Insadong is definitely a place of history. Souvenirs are cheapest here and aplenty. However, shops close early around 8-9pm. Ssamziegil is the main point here as the vendors are artists selling things you would not find elsewhere. The poop bread near the entrance tastes great."
Lovely place to stroll for culture and arts and a cat cafe to check out too !,"Went to check out the different stores there and the 2Cat Cafe . Lovely , pretty stores and restaurants. Take your time when you are there to check out the lanes as well as u will be surprised what you’ll find "
INTERESTING SHOPS & RESTAURANTS,This was our second visit to Insadong and it was just as interesting. We enjoyed the art shops in particular and the restaurants. Well worth a stroll.
Interesting place to purchase souvenirs ,Spent an amazing afternoon roaming the Insadong old street. Many touristy shops but they are a great place to buy pretty souvenirs like pouches and purses in traditional pattern. Many nice tea houses to have afternoon snack. Spent about 3-4 hours here.
"Plenty of foods. Friday nights are awesome, scenic, lovely, fashionable","Especially on friday nights, this maze of alleys are super-filled with good foods, good drinks, good scenes, and fantastic moments.Lots of visual details. Architectures and interiors are unique and creative."
Insadongs' alleys demand a leisurely exploration,"I felt a slower vibe in Insadong. Can't explain why, but meandering its many narrow side streets seemed the right thing to do. Many tourists and locals traverse its main street. I suggest you take the elevator to the top floor of Ssamzeigil Mall and walk down its sloped floors (skip using the stairs). It is fun to watch many male and mostly females walk around in their rented Hanok outfits, feeling like someone else from another time. I think the going rate is about 10,000 Won for 2 hours. There are lots of places to eat here. We thoroughly enjoyed our food choices at Doma, and the manager, Jun Ann, spoke English very well. You will experience the language barrier is South Korea --- but that shouldn't get in the way of having a happy and memorable time here:)"
Art and Tradition,Insadong has many art galleries where the art is available for purchase. There are also several shops to purchase souvenirs and traditional Korean items. All of the signs are in Korean including Starbucks. Out of the many tourist markets in Seoul this is one of the more traditonal ones.

It is well worth a visit to unwind"
Unique Insadong,"Insadong is interesting place to go while we’re in Korea. Many unique cafe, hand craft souvenir. If you like unique souvenir, I recommend you to go there.Many store left and right in 1 way. Spare time to enjoy."
Classy market area known for pottery,For market shoppers thisis a more contained market area. a bit quaint and classier than other larger markets. Prices are a little higher and sellers are a bit more aggressive. You can still bargain fora fair price. Very clean. Known for pottery in this market. 
A good place for souvenirs and antiques,"This street is a good place to do some window shopping, find a few antiques, souvenirs and try some local “Dragon hair candy”Just a few steps into the street, if you are entering from the intersection of Insa-dong and Samuel-damero street, you will find a large souvenir shop and the “Paris crossaint” cafeteria; the first is a good place to shop for some arts and craft (prices are negotiable and they can ship worldwide, so ask), and, the cafeteria, is a good place to get some coffee and dessert while you take a break from a day full of visits.Along the street you’ll find all sorts of souvenir shops catering to every taste you might have.Strollers and wheelchairs will have no problem moving trough the area. "

Fun and enjoyed watching people,Loved the area. A stroll of old and new. Great for inexpensive shopping. Linas is there for coffee and pastries.
Fun shops and restaurants,"this is a great part of town with something for everyone. all sorts of shops, cafes and restaurants. we had lunch here, among 250 different places to choose from. looks like they all serve about the same thing, but I'd recommend walking down a smaller, less traveled alley and go to one of the quaint little restaurants. they are super cute and a lot of fun.this is a great place to buy your souvenirs as well. the street vendors are very nice.there is something I've never seen before here....a cafecare cafe. makes me wonder if you have coffee and eat cats or you bring your kitty as your companion. kind of odd!!!!!"
food alley,"this is a busy food alley with many small restaurants that are busy for lunch and dinner, but otherwise rather deserted."
"Charming area with antique shops, art galleries and more","Insadong is a charming area to spend a couple of hours. The Main Street is insadong - Gil and there are interesting side streets.

Relaxed Shopping,"A short walk from the Gyeongbokgung Palace. This street is a nice introduction to Korean art and crafts, souvenirs and food. The pace is relaxed and friendly. There are many street food vendors and there was street entertainment with music and customs. "
Korean Traditional Place,Many shop and food have been changed to modern style but still you can find Korean special style.아무래도 한국의 서울의 대표명소이다 보니 외국인들의 방문도 많아지고 따라서 여기저기 손질이 되곤 하지만 낡음은 줄어드는만큼 청결해지고 다양해지고 개방형으로 또 개성있는 곳으로 다른 변화를 거듭해가는 듯하다. 그래도 도시에서 잊혀지는 작은 골목길 속의 다양한 풍경은 마음을 끈다. 음식이 조금 비싼 것이 흠이긴 하지만 그런 인식을 벗으려는 듯 가격 조정도 되는 것 같다.
Shopping for Local Products,"This place has a plenty of shops selling souvenirs and antiques and artworks. You can stroll along the street and you will be splashed with plenty of choices for souvenirs and artworks. One particular items that interest me is ""Dojang"", the traditional Korean Stamp which you can custom-made to make your name either in English or in Korean. You should buy this Dojang if you can afford it. obviously the price ranges from cheap to expensive- it depends on materials that you can choose from.Here also you can find small alleyways and there are also lots of restaurants to choose from to fill up that empty stomach after walking along the huge area of insadong.You can use Subway Line 3 (Orange) and alight at Anguk Station and take exit 3."
Great place for local goods,Great shopping area plus plenty of restaurants antique shops art studios to look at plus nearby temples good place to visit
Vibrant ,This place was a great surprise for us as it was so close to our hotel honestly if you’re looking for great local food or souvenirs this place has everything and pretty reasonably priced we only had a stop over here but we definitely are coming back to Korea again and see more 
Lively street,"We came here in the afternoon on a Friday. The street was lively, with so many locals and tourists alike. We had lunch in one of the Dakgalbi places and had drinks at the cat cafe upstairs. Along the street, there were many vendors and shops selling beautiful pottery, art materials, food, clothing and more.It was such a great place to start our trip in Seoul."
Nice Culture Street,I enjoy staying here and hang out in Insadong. I enjoy the street mucisian songs especially at night when not so many people around.I also enjoy the walk in the morning that give you the spirit of shopping.I am happy to buy some local product they have - Korean Product by Korean Artist. I appreciate their work.
Great location for a longer Seoul visit,"We stayed at Orakai Insadong Suites which have great apartments and central to all the shopping, restaurants and subway.Some great restaurants and close to Ikseon Dong alleyways which is a very trendy area for young upmarket Koreans with beautiful little shops and restaurants.Highly recommend the area to explore"
"Just wonder and buy, buy, buy","Lovely neighborhood with very atractive shops where you can purchaise qualitative good especialy women clothes and souvenirs in reasonable price without need to burgain too much.Good atmosphere, clean and friendly. Prices not on the cheap side but fair."
Streets to discover,I love this area because this is where the Ibis Ambassador Hotel is! I love the little bars and shops! Best place if you want a small place to hangout with friends.
Shopping,I have to admit.. visiting Insa-dong was one of my favorite parts of our trip. You can find homemade souvenirs for very cheap here. Plus the street food! We tried a poop shaped pastry with chocolate in the center and it was so good! 
Don't miss!,"Insadong street was very close to our hotel and we just loved exploring it! Don't miss Bukchon Handmade Dumplings, Insa Main Branch. It is famous with the locals and it was a bit hard to find but we asked someone, and this typically friendly and helpful Korean lady brought us two blocks out of her way right to the door of this fabulous place. It's very small, maybe 20 seats tops, and you can have fried or steamed dumplings of many descriptions. After that, we had so much fun exploring the shops. Most of all, we loved the alleyways - mysterious and inviting and totally safe at any time of day or night! Seoul is one of the safest big cities in the world and the people of Seoul are incredibly hospitable and friendly. Multiple times a day we were asked on the street if we needed help finding an address, or getting a taxi, and if we asked someone for directions, they led us straight to the place. Unbelievable. Insadong Street shops have better prices than Myeongdong. We saw someone singing and playing the guitar and another guy playing a steel drum. The vibe is casual and friendly. Found some great treasures, and great food. Don't miss it!"
Place to be for traditional art,Lovely street to hunt for traditional Korean art. Insadong is also the place where the young and upcoming designers showcase their work. Lots of good food and cafes too. 
Traditional items and pasalubongs in Insadong!,A place to be when you are looking for your pasalubongs for your family. Also Ssamziegil is a place to be when you are looking for a unique items.
Car Free Day on the weekend,There are many alleys in Insadong and you probably want to see it all. I went there and walk in the main street only and enter the Ssamziegil Shopping Complex which full of artsy things.
Two day stay in a nearby hotel,"This is a long street with many attractions and little quirky monuments and a beautiful wall Muriel . Lots of shops, eateries and cafes. Lots of interesting side alleys with restaurants and art shops. Beautiful park at the end with an old temple and square."
Nice stroll,Nice stroll along the insadong main street. Not as crowded as places like myeongdong. Explore the smaller streets to discover non touristy restaurants but the staff usually do not speak English nor have English menu. However the food is fantastic at these local restaurants. Tip: follow the locals who make a beeline for the best restaurants during weekday lunchtime. 
best of the old and new,Great shopping for both the traditional and the modern items.  Prices are lower than in Myeongdong and the crowd is not as many.
Lovely neighborhood once you get off the main street,"We visited Insadong on a busy Sunday to experience the crowds, street food and lively atmosphere. We were disappointed at how many souvenir shops there were on the main street, all selling the same cheaply made things. We much preferred wandering down the side streets and alleys, they have far more character than the main street."
A really cool area,Lots of market stalls to see with food and trinkets being sold. Do check the little side street as there are some good architecture to see and interesting restaurants and art shops.
Inspiring and artistic,"If you’re looking for an area that’s chic yet quaint, you’ll love the little alleyways of Insadong just waiting to be discovered. Lots of artisanal cafes and upcoming designer stores here. Food prices are on the high side but i guess you’re paying for the decor and artsy ambience. There were also some vendors hawking street food such as rice cakes and croquette. The locals come here in all their vintage finery to take pictures. Even if you’re not feeling flush, it’s worth a walk through just to feast the eyes!"
Must visit ,the place is great for eating and buying souvenir ... it’s still show the old style korean life .... 
A nice place to visit,"After a full day of business meetings, this was a really nice change of pace, interesting shops, casual walk and chance to wander in and look at shops. I especially liked the shops displaying the artworks displaying Korean scenes like village life and community scenes, all done by Korean artists. They are unique and elegant and employ a range of colours that stand out in the normal beige and brown colour palette of Korea."
Nice walk,"If you have time to visit this area, pretty close to some embassies and temples, the hart of Seoul, you can walk on the street and visit a lot of gifts shops, traditional restaurants and have fun!"
We enjoyed Insadong,We enjoyed this market area; lots of items to see and buy. It was interesting seeing people in the hanbok (korean traditional clothing).
"Great shopping, local artists","Lots of great shopping, handmade jewelry and clothes, cafes and how in the Wall restaurants. Definitely a must"
Different from others shopping area,"Insadong area gives you surprises as some of their shops, I can say most of the shops are selling unique stuffs which we enjoy going into every shops to check thing out, really worth to walk around and spend some time in this area. I did not get the name of the shop lots but they have a yellow word ""人人"" on the outside of the building. Every small shops in there carry their own products and we spend like hours to check every single one out."
Wonderful Shopping Market,Loved the variety of art filled shops for shopping and you can't go wrong with your own personalized stamp. I counted at least five shops that make them.
Interested in 🎨 paintings must visit this place,"This is one of the places that I am fascinated in Seoul. I really like watching artists doing their own craft.

interesting place with nice cafes,"Vibrant crowd, nice place to take pics and chill at the cafes there. Suggest to go on weekday to avoid crowd "
"Once a Great Place to Visit, Now a Tourist Trap","Insadong used to be a great place to visit; small production artisans practicing their craft and selling their wares at a terrific price since there was a lack of middlemen, restaurants that were painstakingly true to the roots of the dishes they prepared, and when the sun went down, a nice local nightlife offering a variety of drinks and food at reasonable prices where people can sit and talk for hours.Then the rents started to go up and the artisans were forced out and replaced by shops selling inferior products of lower quality. The interesting mom and pop restaurants went away in search of cheaper rent. The nightlife got glitzed and glammed for the tourist dollars that always seemed to grow yearly. Analytics have determined what you want to buy and marketers have designed this product mix or maximum return on investment.That's not to say all the shops are gone but the neighborhood has definitely turned a corner and it is more tourist trap than artisan collection.There are still some famous old restaurants at the edges of Insadong that are worth checking out so the general area isn't such a wash.If you visit, Insadong, it will be interesting but not the place of its reputation, at least not any more."
Stayed in this area,"We stayed in Insadong - I loved it. It was filled with lots of eateries in alleyways that had a lot of locals - that is, for us, a sign of a good local resturant. Shopping is mostly local korean heritage and tourist stuff so if you don’t stay in this area, come by in the afternoons to pick up souvenirs for cheap."
Shops and street food,"Alot of unique shops and also antique shops. Visit ssamzie-gil market on the main road of insadong. Unique mall/bazaar with one-of-the-kind clothes, furniture etc. Plenty of street food along the main road."
"Interesting shopping street, many art supply shops","We visited Insadong on a rainy day but armed with umbrellas had a really great time exploring the many art and craft shops. In addition, the are stores selling ice creams, food, souvenirs and everything else.In particular is the Ssamji-gil mall which specializes in arts and crafts and the Poop Cafe also located in the mall. Would like to come here again in finer weather and to explore the smaller lanes that run adjacent to the main street."
"Shops, shops and more shops","Forget the modern malls, this place is shops after shops after shops and it gives you a great walking work out visiting and seeing all that is available. "
"Buzzing, dense shopping and restaurant district","Very busy, all sorts of shops, small but good restaurants. All explorable on foot and within a reasonable time span."
Good location for casual meet,Insadong is good place to meet with friends over coffee. The overall surrounding is also good for deserts and coffee. There are lots of coffee shops in insadong so anyone can explore many new coffee shops. Overall best place to hangout with friends and also after office hours for dinner as there are various options for food and different style of restaurants 
Nice place to shop for Korean souvenirs.,"Insadong has a long main street full of souvenir shops.From clothes, crafts, jewelry, ceramics and a lot more, you will find them here.The side streets are an added bonus. You will find old houses that have been maintained and converted to restaurants along these narrow streets. If not for the modern amenities inside these houses/shops, it feels like walking back in time."
Shopping!!!,This is the place for souvenirs but they ask for cash and will even take US dollars at some stores. in between lots of great places to eat and drink. You are tempted to spend hours getting small gifts.
Just a weekend place,"Spent about 3hrs walking down the main street. mostly selling Korean arts & crafts stuffs and a few quirky stores having queer stuffs like decors, ornaments and traditional clothed items.Still will recommend a visit to see another side of Seoul"
"Touristy shops, daytime only","We combined a walk through Insadong after a morning visiting the Gyeonbokgung Palace and the Bukchon Hanok village, both a short walk away. A friend had said it was a good place to look for gifts and ceramics. In fact we didn’t buy anything but enjoyed looking round the souvenir shops and galleries, and we noticed a lot of restaurants in the area. It was really busy, obviously a popular place. A couple of nights later we decided to go back for dinner but all the shops were already closed and it was also hard to find a restaurant that was still open. We did find one but they were closing at 8.30 and turning customers away from about 8pm, so make sure you go during the daytime or eat early if going for dinner."
Smaller than I thought,I imagined the main Insadong area being much larger and was slightly disappointed. The area is very nice however with tree covered walking areas and helpful information center staff. Area has a large amount of private art gallery and supplies stores. Some very good family-run restaurants are located here in the many narrow alleys!
Great shopping,Insadong is where I was directed by my hotel concierge who already knew me pretty well. It was exactly what I was looking for. The street is not too busy and you can easily cross back and forth. There are shops and street vendors. You can find almost anything from make-up to electronics and furniture. There are plenty of Korean souvenirs from the cheapest to the very expensive. I thought the prices of what I bought was fair although I learned later that most of the prices and shops are geared up for haggling. I’m not a fan of haggling and didn’t bother and am totally satisfied with my purchases. My concierge was kind enough to put the name of the shopping area on the back of a business card in Korean and the flip side had a “please return me to” on it as well so I could hail a cab (very easy) and return to my hotel.
Best place,"I really like this place. You almost got everything there what you need, it's a really nice place to walk around, shopping and meet up with friend's!!!"
Great place for art lover !,Insadong street is the place to be for artsy people ! I must say that this place offer really unique art pieces and you can also enjoy traditional tea houses that offer varieties of Korean tea and Traditional korean snacks. I bought some of Korean souvenirs for friends back at home and I must say that the prices are pretty cheap (you can do some bargain at some of the souvenirs shop). Really recommended to visit for those who are looking for Korean Souvenirs or those who enjoy arts.
Shopping dream,"Great street with various shops - juju tea, art & craft, fashion, galleries & plenty of traditional restaurants.But try not to go in the weekend as it gets very busy!"
nice place,"I stayed in a hostel in this street the times i was in Seoul. nice and safe. in evening also nice to walk, a zone is auto free from a hour"
Its more than the main street!,"This area is more the historical part of Seoul. Old-style architecture of houses abound, but more away from the main touristy Insadong Street. Walk up the side streets for a more authentic look at this area. It is a bustling area. The main Insadong Street is full of shops for nic-nacs and art supplies. Take a look, but discover the wider area. Good access with underground rail. Wear comfy shoes as you will walk a lot!"
Insadong,I love many museums near this road more than this road. This road likes every shopping roads in the Korean.
A M A Z I N G,this street has a gazillion vendors selling from korean made knick knacks to high end silk embroidered tapestries ...also foundlot of art supplies stores.Walked into an amazing store which had rocks from all over the world !!!!!you could easily spend 3 hours here.lots of photographic opportunities .i have found thatbargaining is not tolerated here and prices are fixed unlike in other countries where that would be an option ..lots of food vendors too..don’t forget to try the korean candy floss with nutty filling ..
Insadong has been ruined ,"I lived in Seoul 20 years ago and Insadong was a charming area with traditional tea shops, artisans, and restaurants, all houses in traditional buildings. I was shocked to see what it has become. Many of the traditional buildings are gone and there are so many shops, mostly selling junk. It was almost unrecognizable and a huge disappointment. A victim of its own success i guess. "
Very cool place,Loads of shops selling everything and lots of street vendors as well hawking all kinds of snacks. Try the local cotton candy using rice as a base. Lots of great souvenirs. Clothing is also available. Lots of fun if you like shopping.
Busy Street with Tourist during late night,We stayed near Insadong Street. By walking distance one will be able to access to many tourist spot and Metro Station. Good place to recommend tourist.
Great shopping,"While touristy, it is still a great spot for shopping and just enjoying Seoul. Street food was excellent. "
Interesting part of Seoul,"Was recommended to visit this area. Lots of souvenir shops also places you can hire traditional Korean clothing and wear for a while. Lovely tea shops with traditional snacks. Shopping good but persistent shop assistants who follow you around the shop,which put me off purchasing anything."
Great to explore in the afternoon,"While touristy, the main street of Insadong is still a great place to shop and explore for souvenirs and trinkets. When I was here, a large group of people were parading around and playing music and were dressed in costumes, not hanbok, and it looked like they were acting out a play. The side streets show a more authentic side of the area which I'd highly recommend you check out too."
Korea Visit,"nice place to visit Incheon,seoul and insadong the Korean culture, great temples, scenic country side, clean and beautiful city____________________________________________________jnm"
The artistic side of ROK,Went in February. This is more the artistic side of South Korea. You can wear traditional korean costumes and no one will bat an eye. Apparently the only starbucks in the world with the logo in another language is here. A definite tourist location.
One of my favorite places in Seoul!,"Insadong at first seems like a huge tourist trap full of packed souvenir shops, but if you venture down the alleyways in search of a hanok tea house you will be transported back in time! Also check out a really cool shop with stamped maps from the 1500’s!"
Good Muslim food. Quite limited table and space. Recommended.,Arrived during lunch time. Full house and we have to wait for available seat. friendly owner and certainly must go restaurant if you visit South Korea.
Nice alley at the heart of Seoul,"I personally like this alley. its nice and calm most of the time even though tourists are there, Lot of shops to buy souvenirs, and dine. Colorful area. Must go if you are in Seoul. Jogyesa Temple is nearby so must visit it if you are in this area."
Great place for local food,This is a good place to stop for lunch and dinner. Local food and shops everywhere. Small and narrow alleys which are quite rare to find in this skyscraper city. Absolutely worth a visit.
Souvenirs and those small things ,Very fun place to shop for souvenirs. The place itself is beautiful. Lots of good restaurants with reasonable prices. You can spend around 4 hours here (including meal). 
Touristic area. Take an effort to find decent places.,"This is one of the most well-known touristic streets in Jongro. Especially for foreign tourists.There are many average souvenir shops, fancy cafes and restaurants.So, visitors need to study in advance to avoid tourist traps and to get real good ones. Or spend some time to hang around.I am a bit disappointed to hardly find affordable tea houses, though."
Nice neighbourhood,There are plenty of souvenir shops around. Not as cheap as Dongdaemun market but still good. The shopkeepers are friendly and some can speak English. The little alleys have hidden restaurants and very cheap accommodation if you are backpacking.
Great place to get your souvenirs,"Nice area, which at weekends is closed to traffic. Lots of souvenir , antique, painting and writting shops. Above which are many places to eat and some great tea houses. Dont stay on the main street go up all the side alleys as well."
Super cute but a lil touristy,"Very fun street - definitely worth a quick stroll, and you should check out Ssamzigil shopping center - but definitely feels a bit touristy. If you're trying to buy non-touristy knickknacks, I'd recommend checking out other spots."
Good for souvenirs and handicraft,A square and streets full of Korean handicrafts. Get some as souvenirs for ur friends and family at home 
Traditional Korean themed market,"Our guide said this shopping area is suppose to be old Korean themed so signs are in Korean only. However, it is still very English friendly. Higher quality items and good prices. Lots of pottery, accessories, leather goods, and nice children’s clothes."
Must visit ,"Always a great place to visit in Seoul. Even when it’s crowded Insadong offers a relaxing atmosphere because of the architecture and cultural vibes. There is a quaint little teahouse (see pictures) right in the middle of Insadong that I visited where you can buy traditional Chinese tea and teapots, and a tea master brews tea for you. It was just lovely and the tea was so refreshing. I also loved that there was a vegetarian restaurant there since I don’t eat meat. "
Great place to see traditional things,"Nice place for a tourist to visit. You can find lots of traditional tea houses, gift shops etc. However, it can be a little too touristy."
Peter G,"Great gift shops, we bought many goods a memories here. Very interesting shop where the woman who ran it had made EVERYTHING in the shop herself, amazing"
Excellent ,Interesting place. Recommended to go to to take in the sights and take in the korean culture. Recommended 
Buy traditional souvenirs,There are plenty of restaurants and shops that sell traditional pieces/artwork. The street is not very long. You can tour the whole place in an hour or two. 
Best place for souvenirs,The market and Main Street have a huge selection of souvenirs for great prices. Unique little shops and restaurants down narrow lanes. I really enjoyed the 2.5 hrs we spent here.The metro stop is Anguk on the orange line 3.
My favorite part of the city,The area represents what it was used to be like before the whole Industrial revolution and economic boom. Me and my wife used to date alot there and the place along with Bukchon and Seochon is truly old Seoul that has been the nation’s capital for centuries.
Great Area in Seoul,"This is a lovely area of Seoul. It really feels 'Korean' with lots of back alley stalls, restaurants and bars. You can weave in and out of the main Insadong street and find lots of interesting places to see/visit."
Ideal to wander around,Insa-dong is so nice to wander around since it’s not so crowded as other areas. You see the typical stores like artbox and lots of nice little cafes around there.I would definitely recommend going to the small mall which is in the center of Insa-dongs main street.
Come here for something different,"if you dont want to eat only korean food, this is the place to go.they have a wide range of cuisines here."
get your souvenirs here,"Insadong is a nice and relaxed shopping area. There are many main stream souvenirshops and some restaurants. Nothing vey special, but if you are in the area I would take a look."
Restaurants galore,Many restaurant choices. Art galleries. Good area to buy souvenirs. Best enjoyed by strolling around the area. Visit the Jogyesa temple then visit this area.
Traditional and Art Place,"We decided to visit Insadong on our first day. We took subway line 4 to Chungmuro and transfer to line 3 Angguk Station. At first we were a bit confused with subway system but help of kind Korean people (oppa and unni) we were able to ride the subway without worries. Due to heavy rain, no stalls were set up along the road when we arrived at Insadong. We decided to visit the Ssamzeigil. Then, we went to Ohsegyehyang (vegetarian restaurant) for dinner, however the kitchen did not provide us with many options of menu. Noted that this restaurant was a traditional restaurant, the clients had to open their shoes and sit on the floor. We only had choice to eat bibimbap but the dish was delicious and full our stomach. The tourist centre at the entrance of Insadong was very helpful in showing us the direction and gave us maps. This place was nearby to Hanok Village and Cheongyecheon stream."
Stroll around and relax,"Decided to pay a visit to this location for its historical value, and modern touches. Basically all of Korea. But it was a very relaxing walk with some good shopping, good seats, and surprises. There is an amazing restaurant located all the way at the very end of invading, you would never know its there, but it's where the celebs go to eat, it's called Buk-Mak-Gol. There are amazing jewelry shops, art works, and oh yeah the side entrance to the Presidents Blue House. Great for couples!"
Traditional,"Insadong is my favorite place of all Seoul, it is rich in history, full of traditional restaurants and tea houses but most of all... art galleries."
Shin old teahouse,Nice place for tea and bingeing.The lady is very friendly and do not visit this place in the weekend.fully pack
nice place for foreigners to buy gifts,this is a good place to buy products for friends and family though most products made in China. lot of restaurants to have a quick beer but seven eleven is cheapest.
Great tea house ,Great taste of Korean traditional tea. Good for both business or leisure enjoy traditional house and tea set.
Tourist PR/Info Center and Jogyesa Temple,"Insadong as an area looked to be pretty touristy and gimmicky. The Insadong PR and Tourist Info center was good for hanbok pictorials (only $3 per person). The Jogyesa Temple was a calming place to catch your breath. I would go here again to try out the teahouses in the area. Ssamzigil mall has a lot of touristy gimmicks: if you have time to spend, you can check those out, but if not, I'd recommend steering clear."
Good Vibes,"I loved walking along Insadong! It’s really another way of appreciating Korea through the sights, sounds and the tastes! I found an artwork that I loved and a place for good tea and desserts! It’s worth the walk especially when you want to experience the artsy side of Korea."
Lots of things to do here,"I highly recommend making a stamp (on the second floor)... then drift into an alley for some traditional Korean bulgogi, and 15 minutes away —watch a show called Painter’s Hero (it is like K-pop meets Bob Ross). It is also an interactive show with some involvement with the audience."
Ok,Too many shopping places. Korea is trying hard to get money out of tourists. Some decent food places in the area. 
Traditional market,"Located in the Anguk area which has several tourist attractions around this metro stop, Insa Dong is a traditional Korean market street with pottery, books, artefacts and other cultural things like wooden containers on sale."
"Perfect place for shopping antiques, but I recommend eating sweet dragon moustaches","To get there, take a stop at the same station where you're stopping for Changdeokgung and Bukchon Hanok village. Direction will lead you to some stair ways to proper exit towards Insadong. Walk straight for around 100 meter and once you see a bag store, turn left. Shops and hawkers are lining up on street on both left and right side - most are selling Korean style souvenir- so no need to be worried if what you are looking for is not sold at one store. You can move on to the next one and will find exactly the same stuff but with cheaper price! It is best not to skip hawker's stalls for some unique and tasty snacks, but my recommendation goes for kkul tarae (sweet dragon moustaches as it is said). The last time I bought it, kkul tarae costs you 5000 won and above - price worth for its taste and experience the maker offered."
Hip and Chic,Not so crowded like Myeongdong Shopping Street. Insadong offers various arts and great places to see. 
Arty Crafty and souvenirs,A place where you can see a lot of arts and crafts and interesting souvenirs. Nice to walk in the morning before the crowd arrived. Few restaurants worth trying and a place where you can find hidden treasures.
Insadong Seoul Korea,This place you get to see a little side of old Korea.. Of course you can find lots of souvenirs and food place..
Go with friends and enjoy ,Good for families and even better with friends as this is a chill out venue that cool vibes. Fun at night 
Nice place to walk,Nice area to walk around. Small interesting places to eat and shop. Friendly shop keepers and not bery crowded in morning. Many shops did not open until 10am. But maybe that was because it was summer.
Amazing,It was amazing to walk around Insa-dong satrting from the village ending to the Insa-dong market The village maintained its traditional look and so are he marketsManalOman 
Lovely area. ,"Insadong is a lovely place to visit. Although the souvenirs that were available here we could have also purchased in the underground markets. It’s a great place to spend a day and enjoy the touristy shops, hire a hanbock, and visit the castles. "
traditional Korean stuff,"we bought hanboks here. it was pricy, but good quality. We also bought ""dojang "". Wood is more affordable than stone.. Thanks!"
Souvenirs,You can find here all sort of korean souvenir shops here and good news you can negotiate on price so be bold
Many shop but don't go there on weekend,"This place is very beautiful and so many shop in there. But, when weekend very crowded so we not recomended to enjoy this place on weekend. We want to come again to this place if we back to korea. "
Do not recommend,"As a native that was born and raised in seoul half of my life, I do not recommend this Insadong for buying souvenirs nor the authentic Korean experience. Although designated as a touristic, traditional artistic mecca where one can buy traditional crafts, dont be fooled by the seemingly peaceful vibe with people dressed in modified traditional attire. Many years ago it was a street where many artists would gather and share their art on the street or openly perform, but nowadays the majority of shops carry factory made items and are extremely hostile towards any new artists.Everything from mediocre tea to food is overpriced and I have seen people trying to sell extremely ornate and intricate handicrafts get disrespected and mistreated by these shopwners for the mere fact that they wanted to showcase their art on the street recently. For authentic souvenir shopping I would much rather recommend Hongdae or Namdaemun or other districts where you can meet and buy directly from traditional artisans rather than buying from here. I am leaving this review because I have been extremely disappointed with what I have been seeing the recent years and would not recommend any of my friends to pay for overpriced souvenirs and food."
Unique ,"Very beautiful, lively and colourful. Perfect place to buy unique souvenirs. A long walk. Unique keychains.. Korean handicrafts...bright colourful pouches. "
Must Shop for souveniers,"Ok - this is the street for ""non-tradiitonal"" Korean shopping. AKA a tourist trap. Well, we went to several other traditional markets. Those are interesting experiences, but we didn't really find any good gifts to bring back home. Plus they are crowded and have several unfriendly vendors.In Insadong, we found many friendly shops filled with different gifts at good prices. Jade bracelets, artwork, cartoon socks, hand fans, jewelry boxes...I think the subway requires a transfer and some walking, so we just took taxi for $10 each way from Hongik Univ"
Quaint Village setting,This was one of our favorite places. There are several Korean Tea Houses and Korean Barbecue places to eat at. But what is nice is no cars are aloud it is pedestrian only. The shops are mainly hand made by the korean people. Great place to buy gifts. I am a hat girl and bought 7 hats to take home with me. Fun day here for sure.
Lively and interesting ,"This is a very lively area with lots of shops selling paintings, souvenirs and other handicrafts. There are also interesting little shops and traditional restaurants in the smaller side streets. "
A street with many traditional shops,You can buy many Korean traditional handcrafts and merchandise here. But the price is higher than Namdaemun and Dongdaemun.
Souvenir walk,"a great place in the city to pick up souvenirs like metal bookmarks, key rings, magnets, chop sticks, handicrafts, mother of pearl jewelry/display boxes as well as more unique keepsakes. There is a Hanbok photo place at the Tourist Information centre if you just want to put one on and take a photo. Picked up some lovely jeweled for cheap here. Lots of little places to eat off the street in little laneways. We found a tiny place doing Mandoo (dumplings) which was fabulous, a really authentic feel. The cart selling cocktails amused us.Pick up some cash on your way here. I ran out and it was hard to find an ATM, let alone one that took my card!!"
Place not to miss in Seoul,If you are looking for souvenirs that’s the place not to miss in Seoul. Plus there are a lot of Korean traditional restaurants. Don’t miss out the shop that is dedicated only to tea from Jeju island. Unfortunately I don’t remember the name but surely it will be hard to miss as it’s always crowed. They sell and serve delicious green tea deserts and different tea drinks. Just amazing. We went there second time after a few days just to taste something else before we leave.
"Worth the visit, but mainly intended for tourists","Insadong mainly consists of a shopping street lined with handcraft shops , many of which look questionalble industrial items: especially the cheaper ones, are available identically in dozens of shops. The Osulloc tea room sells very good Korean tea and herbal infusions, but the prices are outrageous."
A great way to spend a morning,"We had a few hours free on a Saturday morning before heading to the airport and, based on reviews here, decided to head over to Insadong. I'm so glad we did! Most of the stores open by 10am - there is a mix of stores selling traditional pottery, artworks as well as souvenir shops and more expensive boutiques and antique stores. Restaurants, tea rooms and snack shops are plentiful. There was a youth orchestra playing traditional music near the park. From Insadong it is a short walk to several other area sites."
Nice market,"Insadong is a ten minute walk from myongdong.just across from dongdemun.went to a lovely cat cafe there.ate at little India cafe, it the curry was just ordinary,trust me I’m a chef myself.but at least it was meat.lovelt casual area for soeveneirs and shopping."
Nice,"in evening we scrolled down in the market, I found bit expensive so not preferred any shopping, but enjoyed street food , very nice stayed there for 2 hours"
Stroll in Insadong,"I had looked forward to walking along the streets in Insadong. There were plenty of unique shops and street vendors along the way so I had no troubles spending my money. .... As it was Monday afternoon, the streets were not too crowded. "
Korean antique shops and restaurants,"The Main Street has numerous shops, especially antique or imitation antique of Korean tea sets and vase, etc. one could also look for items relating to Buddhism here as there is a street that exclusively sells these items. This is also the area where one can have delicious traditional Korean food, especially temple foods and foods from ancient times. There are several hidden tea shops that are gems. This is a fun area to walk around and suitable for families with young children as well."
Shopping place,"Shopping center, whether for the expensive or cheap. Some gifts can be obtained here. Places to eat are also many choices. Easily reachable by subway or taxi."
Worth a short visit (2 hours),"Had lunch here, Hanbok (traditional Korean clothing photo shoot), a little shopping. It’s worth an hour or two if you are in the area. "
Shopping area mainly for arts and crafts,It is a haven for arts and crafts enthusiasts.nevertheless good to browse through the many shops which are a bit different from the meongdong area.
Great Tourist Area,"I enjoyed walking through this area with its numerous shops, galleries, and restaurants. The Poop Cafe is also located in this area. Insadong is within walking distance of the Gyeongbokgung Palace."
Fun hip area,Love this little pocket of Seoul. Great little restaurants and cafes. Specialty and artsy shops and galleries make this a special little area. Just a few minutes from Myung Dong.
A bustling lil city,We stayed at the Centermark hotel for 5 nights which is in the heart of Insadong. The city is very lively with a very busy alley of all sorts of stores and restaurants. 
Tourist street - lots of little stores,"We come to Insadong every time we come to Korea it seems and every time there's something new. It's mostly little shops with various things for sale. You find some good finds. My daughter bough jewelry, we bought a traditional Korean painting (not cheap, but it's going to look good on one of our walls), stationary, souvenir mugs. It's a good place to purchase souvenirs, IMHO. "
Shopping area and many tiny streets,"Full of people, shops and small restaurants. Good place to collect souvenirs, though the choice is not very wide."
Artsy vibe,"Hold on to your wallet. This place has many cute things, I barely able to hold my urge to splurge here. While you are here, find hotteok (red bean sweet fried bun) stall and enjoy warm hotteok."
Vacation,"Insadong also known as Ssamziegil is a famous tourists attraction. The centre point of attraction is the beautifully decorated origami hanging above between buildings. There are loads of souvenir shops around which is suitable for us tourists to spend our money on . If you are feeling tired, fret not because inside Insadong itself lies numerous restaurants, cafés and desserts just waiting for you to discover. Is it worth your time?? UTTERLY YES!! "
Nice area,Trendy area close to the Royal Court. Plenty to do..must see the changing of the guards. Museums a plenty in the neighbourhood. 
Art and culture,"In the main street, you can see a lot of young boys and girls dressed in traditional Korean costumes walking around. There are also some good restaurants around providing modern Korean cuisine of very high standard. For vegetarian food, there is a Michelin one-star restaurant operated by the temple nearby. Worth a visit to it."
Seoul vacation,"We had fun exploring the quaint shops. Souvenirs, food, etc line the street. We took the subway to get to the area. The people at the information center were very helpful. This is a must visit place in Seoul. "
Cute shops and cafes!,"Such a cute location to visit. Even if you only have a few hours, it is worth seeing. Lot's of cuteness!"
Cultural,"It was indeed and great shopping destination for those who love arts and culture, you can see everywhere the pride of korea's culture and arts."
Lovely Shopping Area,Really enjoyed this area of Seoul. Small shops. Many small restaurants. Not a very large area and very manageable.Fun to wander into the shops and see different merchandise. Spent a lovely few hours including tea at Osulloc tea house. Great fun. 
Probably one of the coolest place I have seen,"It's a quaint area, with a local flavor. They seem to offer a lot of tea in this area, which is great if you are looking for tea. The street is very pretty, and there is certainly enough to look at to spend 2 or 3 hours here."
Artsy shopping street,"Not as crowded as Myeongdong Shopping Street. There are so many artistic stuffs being sold, eg: ceramics, calligraphy, mask and so on. You can also find keychain or other souvenirs, you can easily find those things in this place. But if you want to find the best price for the souvenirs, better for you to shop at Namdaemun market.There will be some food street seller in the evening. You can also visit Ssamziegil, unique building with many artistic things, you can shop and join workshop there. Insadong has different specialty compared to Myeongdong. Myeongdong provide many cosmetics store but Insadong provide many artistics stuffs. Visit both of them if you visit Seoul."
A shopping street,It is a shopping area with shops and eateries. Worth a walk through. Plan to have a meal there. Look out locals and tourists who rent local traditional outfits for photo opportunities.
Fun district ,"Don’t be afraid to walk through one of the many side streets in this neighborhood. Some of the best family owned spots are there. Almost all Korean food so if you’re looking for Western food, it’s not here. Lots of souvenir spots as well to browse and people watch."
Interesting neighbourhood full of life,"Insadong is hard to avoid when you are in Seoul as it's kinda between the 2 main palaces, Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung, and South of the Bukchon Hanok Village. The main thoroughfare is interesting with many shops and street stalls but it's a wander into the alleys where you will find the real gems. There are many independent galleries around and shops selling pottery. We found a traditional tea house which our friend brought us to 2 years ago which seemed to be attached to an art gallery (Dawon judging by the reviews from here?). We also found a place which sold some delicious giant dumplings. Must visit when in Seoul - Insadong has something for everyone!! "
Insadong has attitude ,"I visited Insadong following the 10 top attractions in South Korea. I must say I liked it since my arrival, there are shops, nice restaurants, street food, local souvenirs, antique shops, artisans, cartoonists and many more. It’s certainly a vivid, colorful, attractive place to visit.I also had a great time looking at locals dressed up in their traditional clothes coming and going from and to Insadong"
DAWON teahouse & Dragon's beard candy,"We visited Insadong, The cultural and artistic hub of Seoul. Insadong is a vibrant neighborhood of Teahouses, Souvenir shops and modern galleries. Most of ladies in our tour group were interested in handicrafts and jewelry. .DAWONOur tour guide recommended a Traditional Korean Tea House for a soothing tea ceremony. The teahouse is DAWON , it has Low seated tables. There are tearooms where you will have to remove your shoes before being seated. The menu has a variety of hot & cold teas. I had 5 taste-iced tea by the anme of OMIJA Cha, you will experience 5 flavors simultaneously (sour – salty- sweet-bitter and spicy). I love Korean rice cakes. I had Black sesame rice cake with my cold tea. Notice while being there the Apricot trees around your table. SEE card address in photos..Dragon's beard candy The DRAGON Moustache is a great gift for family if you are visiting Seoul. It is a delicate candy and mildly sweet in flavor. It is called Dragon's beard candy (or Chinese cotton candy). Mr. Uki is the master of making this delicate candy; he creates thousands of white shredders out of hard honey in seconds. You will surely need to see his artful technique by your self. Mr. Uki has 3 flavors of pumpkin, chocolate and nuts. The candy has 3 months durability in fridge. SEE his address in photos."
Artsy,Quiet and clean shopping center with an artsy background. There are lots of quaint shops along with delicious restaurants and coffee shops. Very enjoyable. 
It was like old down town.,"There’re many souvenir shops, restaurants, cafe along the main street. Many people in weekend. Just looking around is fun!!"
Cute shops and nice cafes/restaurants,"We really enjoyed the walk down the long shopping street in Insadong. There are cute shops and loads of places to stop for lunch/dinner. You will find nice gifts here, and there are artsy shops, not just your run of the mill cheap souvenir places."
Handcrafts & Tea,"Insadong is a fantastic place to look after korean art and handcrafts. Lots of galleries and shops. If you like pottery etc, you could spend hours in the street. Other then this, a huge ammount of teahouse for every taste."
love the artsy vibes!,lots of shopping and eateries. explore the hanok in the back alleys. we spent an entire afternoon here! 
"From street food to dining, to shopping, and more","A nice mix of everything. Handicrafts, souvenirs, antiques, clothes, cosmetics, fashion accessories, creative artists' mall, etc. A duty free shop/mall is in the area to buy branded cosmetics sometimes at a lower price compared to the street shops. Lots of strolling shoppers any time of day but mostly from the afternoon till evening. There is also a nice traditional Korean tea shop tucked inside one of the small alleys where you get a feel of a rustic quiet, and authentic old Korean house. You can have shaved ice cream with traditional ingredients. There's street food in rolling carts in the afternoons. The tent BBQ's are also a great find here where the restaurants extend the dining area to an open space or garden for the grilling and bbq'ing setting. You'll know it's a good tent BBQ when there are a lot of locals eating and drinking inside having cheers and toasting soju or beer. You'll see the tent bbq's get crowded after 5 PM when the locals come in to have dinner and a few drinks to celebrate or relax after office hours with their colleagues. Insadong location is near places of interest like Jogyesa Temple, Gyeongbokgung Palace, Bosingak Belfry, Jongmyo Shrine, and Kwangjang Market (sometimes spelled GwangJang), and for transit it's very nearby Jonggak train station."
Good shopping,"This is another market in Korea with many fakes. The prices were a bit high, but I did find a couple of items to take home with me. It is always fun to walk these markets."
Lovely street,There are many shops and restaurants here. There is even a cat cafe. A really nice street for strolling and lots of things to see. 
Range of stores,"Visited a temple across the street and then headed down Insadong. Range of shops, many handmade items, a fancy green tea place, and other kitschy shops. Dressed up in hanboks and took pictures for $20."
Great shopping area!,"Fun time to eat shop and see! Best place for souvenir and street foods. I wouldnt say completly cheap but more choices available. Best snack for us was Dragons Beard candy! Its made from fermented honey and corn flour with peanut& sesame filling. They have chocolate flavour,green tea,almond and plain. All the fillings inside remains same only the outer part flavour changes. They make the candies right in front of your eyes. "
Nice place to visit,We walked along the main Insadong shopping street. Shops mainly catered for tourists selling souvenirs etc. Quite a few cafes along the street situated on the second storeys of buildings. Many restaurants too.
A place to buy souvenirs,"Along this street you can find so many souvenir shops selling south korea handcrafts and maybe there is no similar place in Seoul or at least i dont know.the products are not cheap comparing to other south asia countries ,but worth a visit."
A gem for food and shopping ,"Highlight of my recent trip! Wonderful pedestrian street area with countless stores and high quality restaurants. Stores have everything from the usual tourist tat, through homemade art/creative stores to high end pottery and jewelry. "
Living History,"Walking along the streets of INSADONG makes you feel you are in the old era of Korea. Full of living culture, souvenirs etc."
"Shops, Food","It is a nice place to walk around for food and shops. There is this place along the street called Ssamjigil (인사동쌈지길) which has some shops selling interesting items and souvenirs. Slightly different feel as compared to the street outside. At the top of the building, there are some photo spots.This is a likely place to pass by as you walk around that area of Seoul cos I came by after visiting Gyeongbokgung."
A wonderful way to spend an afternoon,My family and I paid a visit to Insadong in the afternoon. There were many shops in the area as well as some rather interesting tea houses. We visited 2 of the tea houses where we enjoyed our afternoon tea and snacks. Overall it was a wonderful place to spend a lazy afternoon.
Starbucks Insadong only one in Asia! ,Starbucks Insadong only one in Asia that wanted to charge extra for a glass of water with your $6 coffee. Excuse me Cheap! Cheap!
Traditional shopping area,"I like the street, lined with quaint hanok houses and selling all the traditional items. You can also find stalls selling Korean traditional snacks with red bean, crackers and peanut sweets. There are quite a number of shops hidden in the alleys that sell Korean tea as well as snacks. If you are not into tea, there is plenty of cafes around too or their bingsu on hot summer days."
Party Hardcore,"Definitely the place to be if you like to party and have a good time. Clubs, cafes and bars lined up next to one another and loud music playing in the street. Liked the place a lot and wish to spend more time here. Again, in terms of safety, it seems that there is relatively low crime rate in Seoul in general. We felt completely safe walking these streets at night. Plenty of taxis in the area and no waiting time to get one, even at night. "
a good outdoor shopping area,a good outdoor shopping area. that you should visit when your in Seoul. I haven't take my time in this place due to the extremely cold weather. a pleasant and a good place to visit
Not my kind of street,"We were here at 9pm and some of the shops are already closed. From what we can see, this area is mostly cafes, restaurants and souvenir shops. Not attractive for me but I am sure some of you out there will appreciate this place. However, plan to come early, maybe late afternoon latest. "
Shopping market,"Plenty of options here to shop, eat, take a souvenir back home. The price is good and negotiable. Try for the small shops outside which are cheaper. Walking around the place is a good time as well. "
Best place for souvenirs ,"Definitely tourist-driven, but there are some shops that have real, authentic goods that are great for gifts and souvenirs. They are in between the more cheap, knick-knack shops. There’s a hidden gem tea house down an alley way that cannot be beat. And walk to the top of the shopping center for the poop emoji cafe! Don’t miss their pancakes!"
Lovely street in Seoul ,A small street full of antiques shops. Really a place to go while visiting Seoul. Spent time looking at small stuff there.
Korean stuff,"It has become way too commercial for my taste than cultural. Many small shops selling pseudo Korean stuff--I don't know ""made in ??"" But still there are very few places that has Korean cultural things in one place. Also the food is good. There are some really good restaurants if you avoid flashy signs."
Good deals on souvenirs,"From the main entrance of Gyeongbokgung palace, turn left and continue walking until you reach a crossroad with an ancient tower in the middle. Across the street, you'll find a big store selling all kinds of bags.Go towards that street and you'll find a lot of Korean souvenir items from KPop memorabilia to the usual items like key chains, chopsticks,spoons, shirts.etc. Some stores allows discount for bulk purchase s, just askfyi, in Insadong, you'll find almost all signages even Starbucks written in Hangul.For calligraphy lovers this is where you can buy brushes and have your own stamp carved in a traditional way"
Charming Shopping Street,"We visited this place twice during our short stay at Myeongdong area. We love the vibes here, very pretty and charming and good for souvenirs shopping.The street is not very long but very lovely with shops, restaurants, cafes etc lining the street and side lanes. By the way, the Alive Museum is located there as well next to the tourist information booth.We walked back to Myeongdong area without much trouble although we could take the metro but getting up and down the stations some hard to find escalators were more troublesome. Along the way, we even had a short walk on the pretty Cheonggyecheon Stream too."
Where the young old local mix with a few tourists,"You could find anything here without being too overcrowded like Myeongdong. Nice area to stay too, touristy but a short walk to the palace area and nearby there are mix of shops for Antiques, cafes, restaurants, art supply and cosmetics. You could also find cool coffee shops, craft beer at the back alley.The streets are nice and breezy with lines of trees. On Sundays, older people hang out by the park and some church choir preaching and singing."
Quirky street,"Though a bit touristy, this street has a lot of charm and fun little handmade goods and art everywhere you look. Definitely has a different vibe than many of the other areas in Seoul."
Market for local test,this is market where you can buy local Korean stuff. not good for foreigner as they dont have any thing to do. if you love to see korean ppl shopping sytyle then its good for you
Don't miss.,"Althogh I appreciated the vibe of Hongdae, I really felt more comfortable in Insadong, as it is more laid back. Still plenty of shopping available, only without the frenzy. "
Lovely recommendation by locals to a quaint arts and craft locale,What a lovely place to spend an afternoon. We were treated to a variety of sights and sounds at a traditional arts and craft type village. The people were warm and the food was great as well. 
Day and night,Walking around day or night this place is interesting. A lot of place to eat are also aaound this street! We really enjoyed it!!!!! 
A good place to get your souvenirs!,There are lots n lots of shop selling (similar) souvenirs. Strongly suggest that you:1. Know what you want then compare prices before buying.2. Don't buy in those air conditioned shop as they sell slightly more expensive.3. Visit Shin Old Tea house to enjoy traditional Korean tea.
Nice place to walk around and buy souvenirs,"I liked this place because there are some street food, souvenir shops and restaurants. I think is one of the places you need to visit been in Seoul."
One of the most amazing shopping area...,"It feels like old and new blended into 1 place. Insadong, offers an unique blend of modern, arts and crafts shops. Can be crowded but that is the charm of it. Try the food, I like the dragon beard candy."
Arty street,"A long street of arty type shops selling independent made jewellery, and other arty stuff for tourists. Seems to be mostly independent run shops. A few cafes and eating places along the street"
"Though very touristic, still worth a visit","I have visited Insadong already many times. Although it is very touristic, it is always nice to stroll aroung on a weekend day and to take in the athomsphere. Just avoid the typical tourist traps. If you walk just a few steps away from the main road crossing Insadong, you will find very nice corners and very good local restaurants."
Must visit n have shopping,Loved this place. Must go for shopping. Lots of souvenirs art n crafts etc for good reasonable price. Street food awesome here. 
Almost everything you need,Quite a quaint place to visit. Resturants galore but it's not much of a night life place. Look to the alleys for hidden gems. We chanced upon a nice bbq place in an alley and was very satisfied despite obvious language barriers. 
Tradition meets Tourism,"Insadong is where traditional arts, crafts and culture meets tourism. You will find some of the same kitch tourist items here that you will find in all the markets, however, if you are looking for traditional handmade items, antiques, beautiful traditional watercolour and ink paintings, amethyst (which Korea is known for) and great examples of white and green jade jewellery, leatherwork etc then this is the place. Great eating spots that are not expensive and walking distance to the 3 main palaces and Jongmyo Shrine and the traditional Hanok Village. Take the time and spend the day in the area and have a good look around. Don't buy at the first place and check your prices. be prepared to walk away if you feel the price is to high. If it can be lowered they will call you back. If it cannot they wont."
"Art galleries, souvenir shops, restaurants","Whenever you go to Insa-Dong you'll find it crowdy but it comes as no surprise as the street is full of life and things to do: art galleries, places to eat, souvenir shops, cafés etc. If you want to buy souvenirs this is definitely the right place to go to. I recommend having a matcha ice cream at Osulloc and continue your visit in Bukchon Hanok Village located nearby."
Ok,"There's a lot of stuff for sale that probably you don't need. Though it's crowded, it's still worth checking out. "
Worth visiting,"In insadong you can see alot of traditional korean houses, and also alot of souvenirs shop located there, street vendors etc."
Nice ambiance,"It s like a village with full of small shopGood restaurant , touristic stuffs, ancestral writing and painting stuff, small bakery and cafe it s a real pleasure to be lost and discover some courtyards and garden Lot of Art Gallery"
Soothing,The feeling of walking on the streets of insadong is amazing. The streets are on the hill and there are small shops located beside. It gives a feeling of Europe.
Not bad but I did not buy anything ,This is nice if you really need to buy an authentic souvenir from Korea. At walking distance from Myongdong after the river. 
Cultural place,"All the signboards written in hangul. (Korean language).u can find a lot of shop selling a souvenir.had a lunch at insadong sujebi,very tasty sujebi and seafood pancake"
Well worth a visit if you can miss the crowds,"I have been here a number of times over the years and it is still worth a visit. Although touristy, there are a number of shops still selling interesting arts and crafts. The bars are expensive but that is not surprising. The feel of the area can also be very nice if you miss the crowds. If you’re in the area it’s certainly worth a stroll around."
A fun place,A must go ....Insadong. It is a cute little narrow shopping street with small shops on both sides. Everything here is related to art and culture. Shops sell items like hand painted fans pottery porcelain items clothes bags slippers scarves etc. There are small coffee shops and restaurants. Street food is plenty. Hotteok was an interesting sweet snack made of dough and filled with nuts and coated with sugar and cinnamon There was also Corn cookie which turned out to be a corn based shell with vanilla Icecream. They were quite unusual Some people were entertaining the crowds by doing some tricksI would definitely recommend a visit to this happening place
Great Dragon's beard candy and traditional Korean dining,"Visited this shopping area for Dragon's beard candy and lunch at a traditional Korean meal (Hanjeongsik). Had a great time, very easy to access from Seoul metro, and the weather was fantastic in the spring time. Best time to visit is definitely off season. Lots of local shops and street food. Got to try Korean dumplings (Mandu) and Korean Dragon's beard candy."
Liked seeing the upscale art galleries but most stores were lower end,"Some really beautiful artwork, pottery, etc., in upscale art galleries on Insadong but generally most of the stores were lower end souvenir or clothing. Quite a few restaurants around."
Traditional street,"You can get a flavour of traditional Korean street which is with lots alleys and galleries, shops, street vendors, tea shops and traditional restaurants."
Shop for souvenirs,"Insadong has lots of souvenir shops. You can find t shirts, fridge magnet, key rings, purse, scarf, chopsticks and so many more. They have very clean public toilet at the end of the road. So no need to worry to look around there for hours. "
Great Souvenirs,Insadong is the right place if you are searching for souvenirs. It has a lot of options to choose from. It has many good Michelin rated restaurants and nice tea places as well.
Nice..,nice place to shop but it is not that busy during winter.. loved the 10000won bag shop.. lots of options at 1 price.. 
Quaint neighbourhood,"Definitely visit, stroll around, get some souvenirs or cloths/accessories or get something to eat. Visit during day time. Cool vibe, cool place"
"Fashionable clothes, art and Osulloc green tea cafe and bakery","If you like small stores that sell elegant clothes, handmade crafts or paintings, this street is for you. You can rent Korean clothes here to wear at a palace. A shoutout to Osulloc Tea House - so many green teas! and the tea pastries and ice cream were excellent. "
"Good vibes, great food, and plentiful souvenirs","After a delayed flight due to mechanical issues in SEA, we ended up unable to make our connection at ICN to India, and had a bonus day in Seoul on the airline, so we took full advantage. Insadong was an unexpected pleasure, easily navigated even with it's plethora of alleyways filled with stores and eateries.As a traveler, this area is ripe for the pickin'. Lots of souvenir trinkets (some rather nice), plenty of art options, lots of restaurants and street food, and even a Starbucks if you can't stand to be far from one. Best of all for the wayward traveler, it's an area that's part of the tourist trade, many languages are spoken, and it's just an extremely cool experience. Interesting architecture lines the roads, and the alleyways filled with those neon signs almost beg you to explore. Being as our time in Seoul was short, and we didn't get to explore more of Seoul within our 24 hour time frame limiting us, this area really made us want to see more of Korea. People were nice, food was good, what's not to like? We'll be back for a longer look around next trip through. I've added some photos (with my failing phone camera at the time), just to give some idea of the area. My apologies for the bad white balance."
Quaint touristy experience ,"For any tourist this is a must!Truly a great experience with small handicraft stores , galleries and a general artistic vibe which was simply fabulous.Bought original hand made Korean Face masks , had some tea and walked around towards the evening as the place was shutting down.There was even a Jazz band playing as we strolled around.. was pretty cool.Also while walking out we discovered this super bar on wheels - where this dude made us some epic Long Island Ice Teas - for 4.5 USD which got us happy high quite fast.Truly made our day :) "
Traditional and lively street ,"Street selling traditional souvenirs represent South Korea in affordable price (traditional hand-carved stamp, hand fan, handmade pouch, you name it). We can see alot of people walking around in hanbok. And don’t skip the small alley you can find alot of good food here. "
"Tourist shops, Art galleries, and Amazing side streets","Shopping is not my thing, however, there were a few things here that caught my eye. The pretty street is a bit of a tourist trap though. There were abundant hanbok shops, 'antique' shops, and many craft shops such as embroidery, adorned boxes, pottery, souvenirs, and the ilk. It did have several nice looking art galleries, which I didn't visit due to time limitations, and in one side street a Knives and Sword shop. I did, however, head off the main shopping street to explore the small side streets, which I believe is called Ssamzigil. These alleys had some amazing and beautiful architecture, some of which were cafes and restaurants.The shopping area didn't open until 10 am and some shops 10.30-11.00am. I went on a weekday. Worth a visit."
Favorite with Koreans and Foreigners,"In Insa-dong street you can buy traditional Korean fine art paintings and antiques. There are traditional tea houses, cafes and restaurants."
Souvenir place in Seoul,We went there for buying things about South Korea but a bit expensive. You can find a lot of souvenir shops in Insadong.
Great atmosphere,"Really enjoyed walking there with my mother, nice small shops and restaurants but we didn't try any of them so I can't write my opinion "
Plenty of character,"This is a lively and interesting place to stroll around, but don't go there expecting to find any bargains. Most of the items on sale seemed to be fairly expensive and not difficult to find elsewhere in the world. "
Good place to get great food and souvenirs,This is a vibrant shopping area filled with stalls selling arts and crafts and souvenirs. There were food stalls in the area as well selling a wide variety of street food. There are also heaps of restaurants in the vicinity.
Such a cool little area!,I loved the feel of Insadong. This was my fourth visit to Seoul and I have loved Insadong every visit. There is so much to do and you should really take the time to explore all of the little alleyways too. Lots of gorgeous little shops selling handicrafts and pottery. There is also Ssamjigil which is a great little cluster of quirky shops and a few poop cafes... don't judge - they were so adorable! It is a really fun place and great for a laugh with friends or kids. Or just some really immature adults. Ahem. :)
Shopping & great food ,"Fun place to get a good snapshot of Korean culture, all within a few blocks. Great food vendors, souvenirs galore, people watching, clothing, Korean spas...this area has it all. Allow some time to really wander and see it all. "
Cool place for souvenirs,"Insadong is a small shopping street filled with souvenir shops and interesting food joints. I visited almost all the main shopping areas in Seoul, but enjoyed Insadong the most for souvenirs. Its also a very nice place to walk around window shopping as well. Picked up a few cool souvenirs from National Souvenir Centre where the they spoke english and were more than willing to explain the details of each souvenir."
Best place to buy traditional souvenirs,Insadong is a must-visit place whenever I stay in Seoul. You can find all kinds of souvenirs from the cheap mass produced items to the unique handcrafted ones. Not to mention the wonderful restaurants along the small side-streets of Insadong.
Unique Korean Art,"In my opinion, this is the best market for souvenir shopping. There are many unique art shops to buy one-of-a-kind handmade/hand painted works. I bought a small ceramic oil lamp, some paintings, and a custom made music box, among other things. And the prices are very reasonable. It’s a great place for getting gifts for others too. And there are plenty of the cheap, mass produced souvenirs around as well. It’s an easy walk to or from Jogyesa Temple, so stop by both. "
Charming,"So charming. Korean craft, food and art. You can really find it all. I went with my mom and kids. We found a place to take pictures with formal korean dresses. It was so much fun."
Great area with everything,This was a place I like with lots and lot’s of things to do and see and feel and taste and eat..you would need a couple of days or more just to be able to see all the interesting places and shops to visit. But what I like the most is the side streets where actually locals eat and chill..you’d need to visit to be able to understand the fathoms of this area.. a more cheaper area than Myeondong-gil aswell..
Love this place!!!,"Nice place to shop for traditional Korean items. The shops pretty much sell the same items, some are expensive than others, you really have to go to atleast 3-4 stores to get an idea of price on items you like. There’s restos yowards the end of the street, PooPoo Land is here, they sell poop emoji- shaped bread with chocolate filling... lots of small crafty shops and boutiques"
JFK JROTC Cadets’ Visit,"I loved this place! You really get to see the culture flourish in the market area- the old and the new compliment each other. We were able to spend two hours in this area shopping, eating, and marveling over the styles and culture of South Korea! I wish we had more time! Try the dragon breathe dessert! It’s amazing- corn starch and honey mixed and stretched over and over to get this mouthwatering treat! I’d go back in a heartbeat! "
Shoppinggg and a whole lot more!,"One thing I like about this place is that it's near the palaces and it's not so crowded plus, it has a public toilet hehehe Street food is a bit cheaper in Myeongdong as well and uf you want to buy some souvenir, this is the place to be. "
Visited the Ddong cafe and shops ,It’s a lovely place to get art and craft items for souvenirs. I got handcrafted hanbok cards and magnetic memo pegs for gifts at reasonable prices. Just browse at the shops along the Main Street. We also visited the Poop cafe on the top floor of Samsziegiel and enjoyed the novelty of it. 
Street full of shops,"It was an interesting and pretty street full of shops. The lanes were also very pretty, with restaurants and more shops. Insadong didn't necessarily sell cosmetics, but other things too, along with interesting and local street food. It's a must visit in Seoul."
Touristy but fun,"This place was packed at the weekend. However it was lots of fun looking at the shops and street food stalls. It’s definitely catered for the tourists, however it’s a fascinating place to be. Especially seeing all the traditional dress shops."
Loved loved loved this place ❤❤❤,"Loved it ❤Quaint market street, loads of good handicrafts, food choices and Korean style clothing. Take a big bag for great purchases ❤"
Funky Spot,"Great little spot, with shops, restaurants, history and culture. With the family - two kids included - this pleased all of us."
Great!,Insadong is amazing! Full of small streets full of reataurants and tea houses! Highly recommended!!!
"Too touristic, too expensive not so nice","The street used to be something unique years ago... however, over time it became a classical tourists trap with very little of the old atmosphere remaining. It has lots of small shops with Chinese cheap souvenirs... There are however a few boutiques with Korean urban city style cloths that are truly amazing BUT unbelievably expensive.... "
Browsing,Had fun wearing the hanbok (Korean dress) and photo session. Also the sweets with peanut filling from the roadside carts was delicious. There’s also a nice tea house in an alley. Fun place to explore. 
Beautiful but touristic ,"The famous street is really nice, a lot of shops, restaurants and Cafés but soooo touristic. It's nice to see. You should go there. "
A Fusion of old and new,"Insa-dong is the premier arts and craft stop in Seoul. It combines just the right mixture of old shops, modern art gallery, museums, and lots of coffee shops and eateries to make an afternoon of browsing, shopping, and eating out a whole lot of fun. But be aware! This area is also popular with the locals - so if you come out for a Saturday or Sunday you may be dealing with more people than you bargained for."
Love the street!,I love the street so much! It’s so relaxing walking there with a lot of antique shops around. The street is not that busy and peak as Myeongdong and other shopping street. 
Must visit Ssamzigil in Insadong,A quaint and quirky area Ssamzigil to visit for creative and original knick knacks and handicrafts to buy. We spent a good half day here. And then had traditional desserts at one of the cafe.
Explore the back alleys!,"I’ve been living in Insadong for over 8 months now and can confirm the area is a “must visit” in every season. Probably 80-90% of tourists never leave the main shopping street, Insadong 9-gil, which is lined with art supply shops, galleries, hanbok rental places, traditional clothing boutiques, pottery shops, tourist shops selling trinkets and k-pop paraphernalia, traditional tea houses and other places of interest to visitors and locals alike. The famous Ssamzie-gil mall is fun to wander through and it has a great selection of small boutiques run by craftspeople - don’t miss the rooftop “poop cafe” for their instagrammable latte served in a toilet mug!Do yourself a favor though, and take a turn in any direction off the main drag and wander down the back alleys. Don’t worry, this is one of the safest cities on earth so you won’t be mugged or harassed in any way! Wandering down the dark and twisty back alleys of the area, you will discover a whole other world of funky old hansik (traditional) restaurants, makgeoli taverns, street art, traditional tea houses, tiny independent shops, and surprising discoveries of all kinds.Grab lunch at one of the local restaurants specializing in old-fashioned Korean specialties that are hard to find in other countries like Sujebi (a light, nourishing soup with strips of rough pasta dough and mussels), jjimdak (chicken stew with carrots, potatoes, and glass noodles available in mild to spicy), mandu (korean dumplings), sweet soy beef ribs, samgyetang (delicious whole chicken stuffed with rice and stewed with ginseng until it’s falling off the bone), and delicious jeon (large fried pancakes made from scallions, mung bean, kimchi, seafood, or potato) of various kinds. Leave room for hotteok, Korea’s astoundingly delicious version of fried dough - this one is stuffed with honey and cinnamon and deep fried. Skip the long lines at the stand at the corner of Insadong 4-gil and instead try the one near the corner of Jongno-ro at the far southern end of the shopping area - their dough is much lighter and puffy and absolutely addictive! Beware the center is like liquid magma - you WILL burn your mouth and get sticky hands but you will have no regrets at all!Insadong is very lively and touristy by day but tends to shut down almost entirely by 8-9pm, when the action moves to other nearby areas like Jonggak’s “Avenue of Youth” and uber-hipster Iksondong or further afield to the party/club areas of Hongdae and Itaewon."
Nice place to do shopping,"A very pleasant area with beautiful houses and lots of souvenir shops. We didn’t buy some things there intending to do it later somewhere else. But we couldn’t find anything like that. So, don’t miss your chance. Enjoy it."
Street Full Of Art,"If you were looking for traditional gift or local hand made gift, you have to come to this place. it's a well known street for hand made shop."
Souvenirs Galore,"DISCLAIMER: I am a huge fan of arts and craft and anything locally made, so this was like heaven for me.Our hotel Concierge recommended us to visit the district of Insa-dong as a sightseeing destination for the 'older part of Seoul' and the 'it' place to buy local souvenirs. I'm so glad she made this recommendation. Insa-dong is a large network of alleys of modern art galleries, tea houses, souvenir shops and arts and craft stores. The main street is a great place to start looking for mainstream souvenirs to take home such as Korean-style kitchenware, old traditional books and handmade paper, haboks (traditional Korean garments), dining utensils, figures, and all round handicrafts (magnets, purses, anything with the Korean flag on it). Traditional tea houses and authentic Korean restaurants are aplenty as you explore the alleys, and before you know it, you would have spent a good hour or two just easing in and out of every corner of Insa-dong.Loved the ambiance and it worth a visit if it is your first time in Seoul!"
Explore the traditional side of Seoul!,"If you are looking for traditional crafts and teahouses, then Insadong is the place for you! I really enjoyed strolling along the alley where they sell Korean souvenirs. You can find anything there in terms of gifts, but also a variety of restaurants serving full course Korean meals. Definitely worth a try. "
Not really unique,"Visit Insadong because we’ve told if this area is the ’old town’ area.Unfortunately, it is not that antique. Here, you could see a very old house next to a modern one, and it’s hard to find an area where all the houses are old. You will not find the ‘ancient’ atmosphere here. But they do have a couple of nice tea house though. "
"""shopping,shopping,shopping""","""If you're looking for some souveneirs for your loved ones & friends, insadong is a place to consider,there's a long lane of stores selling korean items/goods you can choose from & priced just right"""
A cosy place,"A cosy neighbourhood near Gyeongbokgung with many cafes, traditional restaurants, galleries and tea shops. A good tourist spot to go shopping for souvenirs. Had a delicious traditional snack in one of the tea houses!"
Nice Place and a Must,"We were looking for a place where we can get cheap souvenirs to take home for our friends and my dear friend suggested Insadong. Its a very good thing that we went because not only were we able to buy cheap shirts (they gave it at 3shirts for 13000w) which is cheaper than the price in Myeongdong (5-7000w for one shirt). And thats nit the inky pleasant surprise because when we walked and kept looking for a place to eat, we chances upon this nice restaurant (i can not pronounce the name, just look at the pic) where we had one of the best meals we had in Seoul. Insadong should not be missed, not only for the souvenirs but also for are lovers because there are a lot of galleries exhibiting works of young Korean artists."
Fun for a couple hours,"It's fun to walk around this huge shopping street/ area for all different type of ""Artsy"" hand crafted souvenirs to bring home. If hungry, turn into one of the alley ways. There you will find tons of restaurants."
Street Shopping,Lot of souvenir shops around herePrice is expensiveMade in Korea productsPopular with tourists for shopping
A little taste of tradition among high rises and concrete.,Insadong is a more tradition feel then the rest of Seoul. Shops are a lot of times in old Hanok (traditional Korean house) style buildings. This neighborhood is very photogenic with a whiff of history in the air. Traditional Korean snacks made by little old ladies are peddled in the streets here. Cafes and crafts rule this area without being outrageously overpriced. It can get crowded here but generally it clears out quickly. Insadong is very charming with a local old Seoul feel. 
Expensive,"Some souvenirs are made in China and the price is pretty expensive; some do not make any sense. Yet, the insadong street is quite good."
Korea adventure ,Love to shop in insadong for Korean products. Bought lots of the Korean wallets and saw this beautiful table runner. Can’t wait to place it our house. Highly recommend that you visit Insadong to buy gifts to bring back home. 
A glimpse of the lost past,"Insadong is actually very touristy! That is reflected in three prices. However, if you come with limited time and you would like to get something considered typical Korean -> this is your place/ street/ area. Very crowded on weekends.Do not simply stick to the main street, rather stray a bit of into the little alleys left and right. Beautiful cafes and restaurants can be discovered there. "
"This a ""MUST VISIT"" place in Seoul.","Since I live near Seoul I go to this area very often with my family. Although nowadays it is losing its original identity and attractiveness little by little, it still is the place any foreign tourist should visit when in Seoul. There are many small galleries, hard-to-find gift shops, antique stores, old-fashion tea houses, and authentic Korean restaurants. During the weekend, there are many traditional Korean and Western performers to make your visit more enjoyable. Make sure to check out small shops hiding in the small alleys. Now you see more and more chain stores replacing old shops, but it still is a one of kind area in Seoul."
Interesting place to visit ,Isadong is a interesting most of the popular shops here comes with Korean translated signboards. Example the popular Starbucks name are translated in Korean language. Love it’s place becos of the nostalgia. Instagram: @bellytubby
One of the feature shopping/tourist destinations in Seoul,"Be sure to check it out. Probably one of the more pricey shopping areas, but this is one of the most popular areas for street shopping to visit. I bought a color caricature for $18, probably could have found someone to do it for a bit less outside of Insadong, but the artist was nice and she did a great job."
Great walk. Lots too see.,"This a lovely pedestrian precinct, with lovely shops at all sides. Some nice and some touristy. Restaraunt’s are off the side streets. Something for everyone!"
Interesting for half a day,"This area has a mixture of antiques (??), interesting stores, food outlets etc.Really starts around 11am.Some touristy traps, can be expensive."
only 1 day in Seoul so we HAD to go visit Insadong,"We were visiting from the USA for the Winter Olympics. We made a 1-day excursion from Gangneung up to Seoul. So, we HAD to go see the shopping district of Insa-dong. We tried the shopping (lots of interesting stores with a variety of touristy and useful stuff), ate in an upstairs cafe where we had ""tortilla pizza"" Korean-style, and walked around some of the side streets. We noticed lots of people dressed in traditional costumes, either because it was during Lunar New Year season or because a temple was nearby. This was an interesting and fun experience."
Great shopping and street food,"We had a lot of fun shopping and sampling the street food, particularly the gyeranppang (egg bread), dbongbbang (poo bread), and the waffles."
Best place to buy souvenirs,Very artistic works of Koreans can be found here. Nicr souvenirs and nice foods are scattered around the area. Just take your time to look around
Nice place for sight seeing ,This place is artistic and can feel the Korean cultural. There are lots of traditional gift shops if you want to buy gifts for your friends and families and also you can rent a Hanbok and wear 
"Korean souvenirs , arts & crafts street ","We were strolling along this street where it sells Korean souvenirs like tshirt , magnets , arts & crafts . This is my 3rd time to Korea so I didn't buy much souvenir this time . But it's the 1st for my gf so I brought her here to this street to buy korea souvenirs and see the culture "
"Enticing, enchanting and eclectic.","I last visited Insadong in 1993. Wow - wow again!!! How much it has changed. Arty and vibrant with a great selection of art shops, eateries and and art essentials. Browsed through so many shops and studios.Difficult to say which is my favourite, but I think it must be the collection of Kwak Bong Soo in his gallery. Met the artist himself - didn't speak much English but awe inspiring art. Found a fantastic restaurant - basic and simple where I enjoyed Kimchi chegae and bibimbap. Spend a few hours idling around. Even found a ship selling African art. Be inspired - so much around you, I found some plastic photo backdrop material - just 3000 won each - a sure bargain.This street has an eclectic mix, vibrant as art is and an appeal to such a wide audience. Come stroll and enjoy. Savour the atmosphere. Great afternoon out. "
Insadong is th ebest!,"Fantastic area, shopping, street food, culture and if your lucky a drink! So many shops you can buy in and all ready reasonable prices. A tourist must do area in my view. Loved this place!"
Culture and Pasalubong In One,"Since we stayed in Jongno-gu, this place is just a walking distance. This is a superb place! You can enjoy shopping for pasalubong, eating street food while having a taste of Korean culture and heritage. There are so many shops in the area, you can buy variety of items as souvenirs at a very reasonable prices. Items such as nail cutters, key chains, ref magnets all in pad can be bought here. There are also modern coffee shops and restaurants nearby. If you want to buy plenty of souvenir items just be patient in walking around the area. If you want to experience shopping in a cultural area then this is the place for you. This area also boast shops that sell unique cultural items which may come expensive but if you have the money to splurge then its a great find."
Trendy & Cool place,"On top of the hills, overlooking Insadong is Bukchon Hanok Village (Insadong is a neighbourhood of Bukchon Hanok Village). Bukchon Hanok Village is a must see with a guided tour as it consists of old houses, some dating back to the Joseon era. High Offiicials and Nobility used to live there. Gives you a flavour of ""ancient"" Korea. They also have quaint small restaurants where you can have ""Samyetang"" and other Korean food, of course. I would imagine quite a few films and K-drama have been filmed here, I read a few famous ones which boosted the number of visitors to this area.Further down the crest/hill is Insadong proper. Lots of art galleries, handicrafts, cool stuff, delightful restaurants. A trendy arty place with lots of cool knick knacks to buy, good food as well. It is one of my favourite place to visit, after Gangnam. A place one does not mind whiling away time, sipping in the atmosphere, and coffee! Do a bit of shopping and enjoy some good food."
Interesting and artsy,An absolute must for tourists looking for souvenirs and a love for quirky/artsy things which depicts either a new fushion Korea and artifacts depicting Korea old and new. Pricey though. 
Fun Shopping,"In Insadong we found shopping, restaurants and the kimchi museum! A must do. We also had fun visiting a temple and walking the streets. Seoul is more hilly then I expected so wear comfortable shoes. "
Wonderful place for visitors,"The wide, car-free street, awesome dumplings down a side ally (sorry, not sure how to describe location... Just ask) and lots of souviner shopping make it the perfect place for out if tien guests."
Something different in Seoul,We went here to get some local souvenirs and found plenty with great bargain too. Not as many things to eat but they're different from your usual Korean food. Lots of weird stuff to eat and see too. Worth a trip away from the usual KR stuff.
That's a place for tourist or people who dare to lose their way in some little streets,"There, you can find what you are searching about!Tourist places, there is a lot and for all those who dare, it is enough to get lost in the maze of the small alleys to find pleasant hidden restaurants."
interesting place to visit,"There are many shops of Korean traditional things from small gift items to expensive artworks such as Korean traditional paintings, letters etc.,Also there are restaurants to enjoy the korean meals with reasonable price.Worth to visit several hours."
Nice artsy area of Seoul and great traditional restaurants ,Spend half a day strolling in the area and take time to enjoy the small boutiques presenting local crafts and cheap souvenirs. Interesting Buddhist temple on the side and come back to the small alleys and pick one of the many old traditional restaurants offering great Korean dishes. Lose yourself in these alleys and you can discover great courtyards with art galleries. 
Amusing sight seeing,"I don't know but the streets are so pleasing. there are a lot of souvenirs and antiquettes along the way. I ate in a vegetarian restauran near here, the path to the restaurant was very instagram-able but it was raining so i didn't take a picture. "
Fun place in Korea,"Whether you just want to stroll or go shopping, this is one of the must go to venue. Really enjoyed the walk with my sons."
Interesting,The restaurants and tea houses are interesting. Some of the shops are a bit tacky - typical tourist rubbish. Equally some were more interesting and people are friendly
Best trendy neighborhood in Seoul,This trendy neighborhood in Seoul pays homage to the past by its use of very old building exteriors that have been completely gutted and redone inside in charming ways. Hanok alley is here and is full of trendy bars coffee shops and restaurants contained within an alley maze. The kimchi museum is here and there are several art galleries and musical instrument stores as well as artist supply stores. It's not far from one of the palaces and a university so the neighborhood has a very lively feel. It maybe too well discovered by now as it feels more touristy than it did last time I was here. 
Cute neighborhood to rent and wear hanboks,"We accidentally found Insadong when walking to Maple Tree restaurant. The neighborhood was really cute, and since there are a bunch of hanbok rental places, everyone walking around is in a hanbok, so it’s really festive to the eyes. We saw a line of people in an alleyway so we got in line with them and got to eat these awesome meat filled fried mochi things! "
Good place to buy souvenirs,"Insadong can be reached by using the subway train. The street has many souvenir shops. The souvenirs were quite cheap as compared to other places, but you still have to survey from shop to shop to get the best price. Take your time, no need to rush. "
Restaurants,Lots of restaurants and good food. Also cool cafes and galleries. Authentic and enjoyable to walk around.
İnsa-dong,In Insadong there are a lot of shops. You can buy there good presents. You can find there many restaurants. Insadong'dan güzel hediyeler almak mümkün. Ayrıca çok lokanta ve mağaza bulabilirsiniz.
Cultural Hear of Seoul,"A great place to wander around. Lots of narrow alleyways full of restaurants, shops, art-outlets. Street entertainment and everything from bums to beatniks - all watched over by a discreet police presence. A great place to visit if you like Las Ramblas in Barcelona."
Great Shops,"This street have great shops, if you are looking for gifts to bring home this is the place to go, you can find Book stores, teahouses, craft shops, all the traditional Korean Culture. Have great traditional restaurants too."
Well worth visiting,Lots of interesting shops and galleries. Plenty of authentic experiences as well as the inevitable touristy stuff. Street food and local restaurants worth enjoying too 
Cool Neighbourhood!,"This is a great neighbourhood to wander, even though it has a bizarre past. Great tea shops, touristy shopping and street food! Be sure to check out the local artist mall, you won't be disappointed."
"Tucked Away, Korean Gem","Insadong is a great place to go if you want to see art and collectibles. There is paper art, pottery, masks, miniature collectibles and more. There are a few restaurants around as well. I recall stands selling fish cakes, dragon beard candy (which is cool to watch the process of it being made), Tteokbokki and more. There is a trick eye museum, a city escape activity, and a place that sells poop shaped snacks. "
Another Strolling area,"very nice for walking and shopping, i like the atmosphere, lively and friendly... there's also a good cafe here, and it's near the main tourist area like Gwanghamun and Changdeokgung.."
"Korean souvenirs, handicrafts and quaint cafes","There are so many interesting finds in Insadong. From traditional souvenirs to artworks and local handicrafts, Insadong is the best place for these things.There are nice cafes and bars to try out as well. Whether along the main street where people watching can also be done or those hidden along the side streets, you are in for a nice experience."
"Local things, cafes and authentic ","This street is filled with souvenirs and all kind of local things. Either window shopping or buying things, visiting Insadong is a must. Don't forget to visit café or Ssamjigil while you are in Insadong. "
Good street full of local knick knacks!,"If you're the type who's in for a good bargain, from fashion to goods of tradition, make sure to visit this street! "
Shopping and see local artcrafts,Insadong is a great sight for family shopping. All kinds of economy price products and foods. Lively shopping streets! Many tea cafes to take a rest and observe beautiful local culture of modern Korea. You can start shopping from 10 am until 10 pm. 
"Touristy, fun","Came out here to drink makgeolli at ""Story of the Blue Star"" - cool little bar. Neighborhood is absolutely worth walking around, talked to a bunch of street merchants. Good afternoon."
nice feel of the place,"Don't miss Insadong. the feel of the place is nice and authentic, almost like you're a part of the ancient koreans."
So many cafes and cool crafts ,There are so many cafes and cool crafts located in Insadong area. It's totally different from Myengdong which full of cosmetic shops. Worth to look around for cool souvenirs. 
Street festival,A great place to wander around for traditional Korean arts and crafts. Street performances at the right time of the year and a rather enjoyable experience!
Good souvenirs,"If you are looking for real Korean stuff made by Koreans this is the spot to haunt. Enjoy wandering down the streets, just ignore all the basic touristy crap and look for the nicer objects to buy."
Window shopping is grand!,"Lots of shopping offering a wide variety of goods, prices and quality. You can find made in China, made in Korea and other far away places. Neat gifts for taking home plus art galleries and places for grabbing a snack or a meal. Way better than a food court with a huge selection to choose from. We had shaved ice, sticky rice treats, coffees and dinner. So good!We also went to the Kimchi museum and signed up for the kimchi making class! The class was presented in English! We are food nerds so we totally enjoyed everything kimchi, xoxo."
Great to walk through!,"This isn't the traditional market like in some of the villages or other parts of the city, but it is perfect for souvenir shopping as a one-stop. Some of the shops also take credit cards, which you won't really find at other markets around the city."
Quick trip,"I've been there with my gf, the day was her birthday. We had a plan to visit a specific gallery for an exhibition, which was 'Brick Art'. The display has bee began in a couple of years ago. It was a pretty good and quiet refresh. I'm highly recommended! "
Fun traditional neighborhood,"Insadong was the first place we visited in Seoul. We liked the old style neighborhood. One main street with lots of foot traffic and small stores, back alleys, small restaurants and charm. Insadong is more authentic and traditional than many other parts of Seoul. It's small and one probably doesn't need to spend more than a few hours there to get a feel for it. But compared to Myung-dong, Apkujung-dong there's more character to the neighborhood. It's also easier to spell...Nice tea shops, arts and crafts, souvenir shops. In the back alleys there are traditional restaurants."
Lots of shops,"An emormous variety of shops and other places to visit. Near a big temple too. In winter, hard to walk around a long time."
Ok,Not much to say. Did some shopping and eating. It was good food and good prices for the souvenirs. It wasn't busy when my wife and I were there so it was easy to get around.
Lovely area to browse,"Nice arty shops along with souvenirs, and some local fashion - wide boulevard pedestrian areas, easy to get to."
"Korea, Korea!","You can do everything here! Shopping, eating, cultural experience all in central part of Seoul. I always visit Insadong whenever I visit Korea. Easy to get to and English signage everywhere. You can spend whole day or come back for more! Also Palace and Secret Garden nearby. A must visit in Seoul!"
Love the Neighbourhood,Felt peaceful strolling around this area. Lots of cute shops with craft gifls and fashion. It's not as busy as Myeongdong and Hongdae. It's just like a breath of fresh air. Just grab a coffee and enjoy the walk... you will feel great.
unique items,it's fun to buy souvenirs here as you can see unique items from cheap to expensive ones. you can also bargain depending on the number of items you will buy from one stall
Nothing special,"The place looked fairly plain, which was a bit of a let down for a place that is supposed to be a hotspot of art in Seoul. The shops sold mainly traditional souvenirs, so it may not appeal to all types of shoppers. There was also not much activity in the area, although this could be due to the fact that it was raining when we visited."
 Good souvenir deals,"If you are looking for Korean souvenirs, insa-dong offers a good choice. There are many sellers. Most shops close around 8pm. The sellers usually provide a small discount on the marked price. "
A fun experience ,"Its ambience and people was nice. Wide range of shops and restaurants. Many handicrafts shops, but the street food was amazing."
Nice place to Walk Around and have Lunch,Came for a walk - nice area for that as it is pedestrian only. There are various art shops and places to pick up cute niche things. We came for a walk during the day and had lunch before leaving. Easy to reach with metro or bus.
"Great Fun Watching 16,000 String Honey Candy Being Made","We had great fun watching the honey candy being made into 16,000 strings (Dragon's Beard), and the candy-makers are so hilarious. It takes less than a minute for the candy string to reach over 16,000 strands, so be sure to watch it. The candy is really delicious with a nut filling wrapped inside. Isadong has lots of little shops and stalls, and we had the best lunch there as well as a memorable time watching the candy being made, and bringing some home. The photo that I included is of the hilarious candymaker who asked where we were from, then told us facts about each of our cities (San Diego, Seattle)."
A fun walk to stop and have lunch,"I love Insadong. Lots of art galleries, shops , stores and restaurants ! It's bright, colorful and a great place to take guests when visiting Seoul. Easy to get to by subway and then a perfect place to stop for lunch and to have delicious (although expensive) tea at the Osulluc Tea House. I've been several times and am never disappointed with the trip. "
Another place to shop,"This place was near to Bukchon and as usual, all the beauty shops were also all around the area. Somewhat similar to the other shopping districts so it did not make much difference to me. I felt that it was less crowded in Insadong so there was less hassle."
Very well worth a visit ,"Interesting place with some traditional/ artsy shops and boutiques around. You can find some unusual souveneers and home goods made in Korea, which are usually more expensive than those made in China. I've bought some greeting cards with a paper figure of traditional Korean hanbok clothing."
Great walk,"Take your time to go inside the narrow streets and get lost within the bars and restaurants around. Do not hurry, just enjoy being in Soul."
Alley Hip,"Trendy, smart, young. Explore Insadon alleys and you will find great cafes , antiques and hip coffee culture everywhere. Interesting renovations of old houses made into cool designer shops next to noodle shops with lines of young beautiful people waiting for a bowl. Take a afternoon and explore!"
Souvenirs,Best area to find cheap but excellent qualitysouvenir items. Each stalll has different items to offer so better not stick to 1 store only.
"Not much to shop, good for hanbok rental",Rent a hanbok at KRW 10k per 2 hours. Great choices and competitive pricing due to plenty of rental shops there.
Nice Place for Traditional Activities,"There are many traditional activities that you can partake in Insadong, like korean craft making, kimchi museum and traditional tea tasting and also lots of traditional snacks.A lot of the food items here are handmade compared to those in other areas which are usually already in packets."
Nice place for street shopping and souvenirs,"We visited Insadong specially for the Poop Cafe at Ssamziegil Mall. The Mall itself was quite interesting with many unique, small little shops selling pretty little items. The Mall was also designed such that you would walk up/down the spiral walkway and you would walk past every shop. We roamed the streets in the late afternoon for souvenirs. The area was clean and conducive, and many souvenir shops with similar pricing. We bought our souvenirs from a nice lady, the shop was very near Ssamziegil Mall, and she gave us some discount. We also ended up buying more souvenirs than planned, as they were very nice. I would recommend this place to visitors looking for souvenirs."
When traditional and modern mixed together,The best place to find unique souvenirs in reasonable price. Somehow the souvenir sold here isn't sold anywhere else.
Nice,"Beautifully-laid out street, but nothing very special. Just a lot of stores and coffee shops. Instagrammable-place though!"
Winter,Interesting place. The alleys are full of surprises. It has traditional tea house as well as modern cafes.
Average,"Insadong is a hyped up shopping district, no thanks to those Korean tv shows like Running Man. In reality, its really an ordinary looking place with its various shops selling antiques or quirky curios. The street performances light up the atmosphere occasionally, but this is not a must-go if you are tied for time."
Wish We Had More Time,"If you like exploring stores, bar hopping, sitting in cafes, searching for antiques or memorabilia --or even bowling--this is a good neighborhood to explore. We did not have a lot of time because of other priorities.-- much to my dismay!"
Hands-down best souvenir shopping,"Insa-dong's main shopping street has everything you could want for souvenirs, many of good quality. Stop in Ssamzie-gil 4-story shopping plaza just off to the side while here. It's a ramped walk up in a spiral with shops off to the sides. There are info booths at both ends of the main street, closed to cars on weekends, so you can get information as needed. Lots of alleys to explore so plan for some time here."
Hand crafts and restaurants ,"If you look to buy handcrafts for souvenir, this is the place. You can find antique-esque items as well as modern art pieces along the street.There’re also lots of restaurants."
Nice place for young adults,"I think this is a good spot if you’re in the area, enjoy walking, having coffee or dinner at one of its hidden restaurants with typical Korean food.Tip, best food is the hidden streets of insadong, much better that the ones on the main streets. Try it! It’s safe"
Visit on Weekends,"Insadong is closed off to traffic on Sat (2pm-10pm) and Sun (10am-10pm).On the Sat we visited, we saw a protest group saying no to dog meat trade. Interesting!There were also a few performances, and I especially enjoyed the one by college students (farmer’s music and dance) at the end of Insadong-gil (near Tapgol Park).As I am not an artsy type, I didn’t spend much time browsing the galleries and souvenir shops. Had planned to spend a couple of hours. But left pretty soon as one souvenir shop is almost the same as another.Went on to Hongdae which I found has better vibe."
Lots to see and cheap souvenirs,"Great place for wandering around. Live performances on Saturdays. Cheap souvenirs and Korean pottery, antiques. Be sure to duck into the art galleries while wandering around, and get a coffee and poop-shaped pastry at the Ddo-ong cafe in the Ssamzigil complex!"
Fascinating Insadong,"Came here on our first day of arrival, fascinated by its creativeness amidst the tradition and modernisation. Absolutely a good start for our exploration in Seoul. 3500 won ice cream was one of the best here!"
Art Street in Seoul,A lot of Art on this street and have many restaurants that you must taste if you come here its call Mundoo (만두). 
"Authentic, but touristy and busy","It's a reasonable walking street with some nice shops and products, but a few will try to pressure you, just step out and move on."
Trendy but you pay extra for the coolness ,We found a few unique shops here but the majority of things could be found elsewhere cheaper. Poop Cafe was cute with the top level having discs with devotions of love written out and tied to the railings. 
Nice to explore ,Nice area to walk around and explore. Lots of street food on offer. A little touristy but still a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.
Cool place to shop,Very nice area and cool place to visits. Very recommend to try street food vendors. Make sure to try fried dough with noodles or honey. 
Explore and Shop,"Insadong is a great area to explore and find some great gifts for home.They have an information booth with people that can speak several different languages and provide you with a map and guidance of the area. They have street vendors, store vendors and an array of different items and treasures to be found. The metro is located near by and the shopping area is fun to check out. You may enjoy checking out either the poop cafe or the cat cafe."
Must visit ,"Every time I visit my family in Korea, I always make time to visit this area. It’s close to one of the old palaces and great place to appreciate old Korean traditions. Many shops selling old Korean goods for souvenirs to take back. You can also rent the Korean traditional Hanbok dresses and take pictures around this area as well as the palace."
Quite place,"Nothing much. Every shop sell the samething. Very boring area. Just a street. Once you cover area Buchok village, by walk can go to insadong, so convenience. "
Seoul Trinkets,"Worth to visit if you love collecting mementos, don't forget to haggle a bit as some of the items are overpriced."
"Shopping, tea places, fashion apparel .",Went to shop around had lunch and exploring. It was near the Jongmyo Shrine a UNESCO world heritage shrine.
Souvenirs ,Insadong is the place to go to get all of your Korean souvenirs. They have tons of deals and offer inexpensive Korean made souvenirs for anyone to take home. Make sure you walk down all the side streets to see what they have to offer. 
Basically a tourist area,"We didn't really see anything that felt particularly ""culturally authentic"" here--essentially a strip of souvenir shops, restaurants, and cafes. There was some traditional dancing happening at the end of the street nearest Gyeongbokgung Palace which had attracted a large crowd, but not sure if that's a daily occurrence. Worth a visit if you need some souvenirs."
Casual and entertaining strip,"I have written about Insadong twice, so you can read those reviews to see exactly how to get to the Insadong area and location. Most of my last reviews ares still pertinent today. It can be very crowded, but being a mostly pedestrian street, some vehicle pass thru, it can be as casual as you want to make it. Gyoja for dumplings is great, Starbucks is as usual, very crowded on all three floors. Many small shops with hand made one of a kinds and of course souvenirs. Also, try the finely whipped honey candy. See my pics. Enjoy it."
Different souvenirs 👍,This place is one of the places you should visit if you want to buy lots of souvenirs. They have a lot of options and they’re sold at a cheaper price compared to Myeongdong. They also have a lot of nice restaurants in here. 
Chilling and browsing,Nice place to stroll through and browse different shops and experience different tastes. Nice and relaxed and usually not too busy !
Shopping!,This was my favorite shopping area in Seoul. It was very artsy with lots of shops and vendors with items for sale that they made. I loved the little food vendors too. I bought lots of clothes and art type items here. We visited twice during our trip.
Lovely alleys and curio shops along Insadong,"Insadong provides distinct galleries, museums and shops and a good introduction to Templestay cuisine. It has good souvenir ahops and some alleys provide cultural shows, music and exhibits."
Love Insadong,"I love Insadong. I could easily spend 2 full days here as i love arts and crafts and there are also new designers, artist etc etc. For my next visit, I will stay in Insadong"
Must Visit,"On my visit to Seoul we stayed in a hostel right in the heart of Insadong. We were at first unsure of the location but after arriving there were no issues. What an absolutely beautiful place and a perfect mix of new and old. Plenty of shops, food and sights. Truly a place where you can fully emerse in the culture. To top it off there are great transport links all around, but that goes for all of Seoul. "
It's just a place for tourists,"I come to Korea to enjoy the local culture, not western culture. therefore this is really a place not for me, a short term visitor. However I would presume there are more expats over here than anywhere else in Seoul. I agree people here speaks better English than other parts of Seoul."
Walking and Sightseeing,This is a bit of tourist trap at first. But actually here's the place for you to appreciate the artsy stuff and traditional items of the country. You can also enjoy the affordable poop bread and re-enact the WGM scene at Miss Lee cafe.
That that spectecular,"This is promoted as a souvernir/tourist gift street, and it's just that. Nothing special (many of the souvenirs can be found cheaper at e.g. Daiso), however fun to stroll around and to see the little artsy shops."
Come here for culture and souvenir,This is the place to get Korean-related souvenirs with many shops selling all kinds of gifts you can possibly think so. The place comes alive at night. Took a stroll into the small alleys and you may find hidden gems like a charming tea shop that I went into but forgotten the name. You can easily spend hours here just walking to this shop and that.
"Cultural District in Seoul - Kimchi museum, antique shops and more",It's just a busy short street (less than 1 km long) full of art and craft shops. Many small traditional restaurants on the alley off the Insadong main street. We came here to visit Kimchi museum (Museum Kimchikan) which is located at Insadong Maru. Stopped by a traditional tea house for jujube tea and Korean rice snacks.Spent a good 2-3 hours there including lunch!
Shopping for tourist gifts,I had fun exploring and picking up little gifts to bring home. There were a lot of stores to explore. There was even a parade!I enjoyed the caricature artist.
Good Street For Shopping,It's a walking street with a lot of stores and big varieties for shopping. Pleasant street for shopping.
Lovely neighbourhood,"Loved strolling around here. It's a very hip area and it's never boring, lots of things to see and do. Worth an afternoon/evening if your time!"
Insadong in Seoul.,"This market area is remarkable with a plethora of shops of every description, restaurants, street stallscatering for up market, mid range and bargains.Exciting atmosphere. Highly recommended."
Fascinating Glimpse of the Past,"If you love traditional Asia—tea houses, traditional potters, antiques, traditional crafts made by masters and traditional local foods served in artfully designed eateries—you’ll love this area. Yes, it also has a plethora of souvenir trinkets and tourist trap like establishments but a far greater number of really nice shops centered around the traditional life of Koreans. Get there before it gets overrun by franchises (Starbucks has even made it here already). But for now, there’s still plenty to enjoy. And it’s centrally located in the middle of old Seoul. Easy to get from here to the various palaces and ancient historical sites. "
Insadong,Perfect place to buy souvenir in Seoul! You find different thing from low to hi prices there. Sometimes there area also traditional ceremonies there. 
Insadong,"Great neighbourhood! There is so much to see, do, and eat here. I would plan ahead and map out what you want to do. Lots of small alleys that have all sorts of little shops - guaranteed, you’ll spend a lot of time here."
Loved the atmosphere ,Would totally visit and explore this place again in my next trip to seoul. So many unique stores and souvenirs to see. Loved the atmosphere of this area.
Souvenir Haven!,"A souvenir shopping haven plus restaurants! It reminds me of Tokyo, they have small alleys that hide the different restaurants that they have.We just tried one the restaurant out of curiosity and whala, it did not disappoint at all.Would surely be back here whenever in Seoul!"
"Enjoy Maze-like Streets, Old Houses, Beautiful Stores & Food","Small narrow maze-like streets, full of old houses and beautiful stores selling handmade accessories and many quality products (bought gifts for friends here). Food sold was great and I enjoyed dumplings and gelato. Oh, coffee was very good too (seems qualified barista working in this area)"
Beautiful area with traditional crafts,"Insa-dong Street is about a mile long and runs from Tapgol Park to Anguk. It is a pretty street that has many shops which sell traditional Korean art and craft work like traditional teas and paper (hanji); pottery, traditional costumes and crafts. The area started off as an artists study place – and this is still an area where you can see painters and craftsmen who have set up their shops selling traditional crafts and pottery and paintings. You really get the feel of traditional Korea here. There are regular art festivals held in this area. It is truly a memorable experience as you walk down this street taking in all the traditions of Korea. Shops in Insa-dong specialize in a wide variety of goods that can only be purchased or appreciated in Korea. The most popular items are Korean ceramics. You need to be able to haggle to get a good bargain. There range in prices is very wide. You can also find antique furniture, souvenirs, calligraphy items, earthenware, and a host of other small collectables. There are also a number of small cafes and restaurants. The good thing is that the street is vehicle free on weekends. There is an Information centre that is open from 9.30am to 6.30pm."
Great bars and shopping,"I love Insadong. Very trendy and great alley ways with hidden bars, tea houses and restaurants. Locals are super friendly to foreigners and felt safe and looked after."
Artsy Area,"This is a nice shopping district between major tourist points in Seoul. Great for Art Galleries, Arts & Crafts, Souvenirs, Cafes and People Watching. I like to check this area out for unique gifts and just getting lost walking around taking photos. "
Souvenir shopping haven,A shopping haven for those intending to buy souvenirs. Shop around first before buying as it is cheaper when you are deeper in the alleys than outside.
"Lots of interesting shops, restaurants and tea / coffee shops","So much to see in this area, particularly in Insa-dong street itself. It's full of art galleries and design outlets. Arts and crafts abound.Excellent area to just walk about to soak up the atmosphere."
Artsy area to explore with lots of charm,"I spent several months intimately getting to know this area as I worked within it at the Fun Caricature booth. There's a LOT to absorb in the relatively small footprint of the area. A quick walk from Anguk station, or moderately easy trek Yim's guest house (where I stayed during my first visit) you'll find the winding alleys with traditional style houses offering crafts and souveniers, restaurants and street carts a plenty. Grab an ornate hand-made blouse, try on hanbok, sample a sweet potato latte or get drawn by any of the super-talented locals or guests artists. Pop on over to the kimchi museum to whet your fascination for the history of the fabulously funky fermented goodness or shop for skincare goods at any of the stores lining the main avenues. One of the best parts about Seoul is how walkable it is and you can easily walk to Jongno-3ga and Gwangjang market from here, or check out any of the awesome temples or government buildings nearby. I greatly enjoyed spending time in the area and would gladly recommend it to anyone planning to visit Seoul in the future. "
Souvenir Shopping,Its a nice place to shop for souvenir items and lots of choices.It can get crowded too.Lots of cafe and shops.
Nice area to relax,"The whole street is nice. You can fill old culture with a lot of shops with traditional craft works. All around you can find a lot and I mean a lot of restaurants, tea bars and street food as well."
High prices for tourists,"While there are some interesting things to see in this neighborhood (the temple and the shops selling Buddhist goods), most of it is overpriced items and food aimed at tourists. "
Unexpected Traditional Parade,We came on a Monsay at about lunch time and we didnt expect a traditional marching band was performing because it was a week day. We were just lucky enough that we were there at the right time and got to witness it.
Nice way to spend an afternoon,"Insadong is one of Seoul’s cultural and artistic neighborhoods. It is very touristy with lots of tea shops, restaurants, street foods, art galleries, and of course, souvenir shops. Among the kitschy shops, however, are some very interesting ones that have beautiful handmade crafts and works of art. It’s a fun afternoon of browsing and the perfect place to find gifts. "
Full of Craft and specialist shops,"We found this area on our first day, it was fantastic, packed with little specialist shops, hand made crafts and all sorts of interesting things to look at. Loads of restaurants of all sorts. Check out the tourist information where they have a place to try on traditional Hanbok outfits for a nominal fee, they will even take photos for you. "
Cat cafe visit,"We were there especially for a cat cafe, other than that too touristy for me. Too many people and shops sell traditional souveniers which we were not interested in buying"
Artists haven,"Great place to buy original korean made items, we bought our cortile bags here, can't be found anywhere else"
Souveniers and Food,"If you want to buy souveniers better to go to this place. Theres a lot of items you can buy here, though the price is not really bad. you can do both shopping and food trip.. Walk from end to end there are lots of shop hiding on the sides sp make sure you go and check those small roads from left to right :) "
Great place to visit in Seoul,"Insadong is simply great. All tourists visit it and maybe that's the reason why it can be a little bit pricey but you can really feel the atmosphere of the old Seoul in here. Insadong has some great tea shops and traditional Korean restaurants.You can buy some great Korean paitings, ceramics, souvenirs, clothes. It's right next to Jongno."
Very touristy,Very touristy but still very much worth a visit. Lots of traditional food offerings from street stalls and tea houses to higher end more expensive ones. Also quite fun to watch hordes of people dressed up in hanbok. 
Very nice!,"I love insadong! You can find any traditional stuff here. Nice shops, nice food! Very crowded during weekends. If you prefer a quiet enjoyment, visit during weekdays. However, traditional street performance only happens during weekends."
Old Seoul town,"We visited on Sunday as the Main Street is block. It was supposed to have singing, dancing on the street. We were there in the morning at 10 am. No activities going on in the street. There were not many people walking either. Nothing exciting accept the stalls sell different things compare to down town Seoul. "
Romance of an old Korea,"I went here with my wife. Great atmosphere - narrow streets, chic shops, great restaurants. Really a great place to stroll thtough and have lunch or dinner. "
"""'hairclip""""",plenty of traditional shops and information office available before the area..i was able to purchase a handmade necklace and hairclip..My hairclip is so lovely thou its heavy ..i feel like a princess..lol
Cute but very touristy,"Nice shopping streets but similar to other districts for this. Make sure to try the little tea shops and Korean dessert, as this is what sets it apart from other districts. Night life caters to foreigners"
Touristily hip,"This art strip offers reletively good eats easy on the pocket. To look out for is the small kimbap eatery and the dimsum place tucked in a small alley.must try here are their beef balls and leek dimsum. Souvenirs are priced well but not as cheap as in Itaewon.Lining the streets are RTW shop of local designers as well as art galleries featuring local artists. You can also score traditional/ Buddhist artifacts here. But as far as authenticity is concerned, I've no idea.Overall, Insadong should be part of a first-timer's itinerary in Seoul."
Place of arts and crafts ,"If you looking for the local arts and crafts, here is the right place for you. A lot of shops selling crafts here where you can easily finds and try the local foods also. There’s a shop that u can rent the hanbok for photo-shot. "
Great Shopping,"Out of all of the places we shopped in Seoul, this was by far my favorite. It is the best place to find more of the traditional Korean gifts"
A place to visit for souvenirs,"Souvenirs in the thousands at reasonable prices in any shape and size, Lovely shopping and dining area with tea houses and bordered by a palace and Buddhist temple"
Especially Art,"This is the right neighborhood for those interested in art, art supplies, antiques, and very nice clothes. There are many shopping streets in Seoul but this neighborhood is unique. We bought hand made paper for our daughter and an embroidered blouse for my wife. It's also a great neighborhood to just walk about in and there is a beautiful Buddhist temple on the east side of the neighborhood. Don't miss it."
The local arts and culture vibe,"Insadong has art shops, galleries and exhibits, restaurants offering a taste of local cuisine, shops that offer local products and there are also various activities even in the evening. It is a very good place to buy souvenir items."
"Interesting area, Very crowded",As long as you don't mind fighting through crowds this is a great place to visit. Make sure to try some of the delicious street foods on offer and check out the Jogyesa Temple located down the side streets.
Nice cultural place to walk around,We chance upon this place after visiting the Changdeokgung Palace. Its within 15 mins walking distance. Nice walk about where you can find local delicacies. Less vibrant as compared with Myeongdong. 
Hidden Korean restaurants ,Shopping is whatever you fancy and worthwhile to stroll through the street and enter the shops.Exploring the alley ways ( gil-12?) we found a lovely Korean restaurant in a traditional setting. Great homemade food and delicious glutinous rice wine was had for dinner. And not that expensive. A thoroughly enjoyable experience!
good to visit if you want to know more korea traditional things,"if you want to try wearing hanbok, you should visit here coz there are many people wear hanbok walk around, then you not a shame to do as they do and can walk around"
"A whole lot of the same stuff, yet some surprises too.","My dad and I decided to come here because of the reviews we had read. Actually was a very happening place. Many of the shops offered the same mass made souvenirs. But there were some fun surprised like a hand made treat out of honey, starch and almonds that looks very interesting. A lot of calligraphy stores and stamp stores as well. A fun place to take a walk."
Traditional creations,"The Insadong shopping area offers many opportunities for acquiring traditional Korean art and other Korean made items. The shop owners are very friendly and prices are reasonable. Many beautiful art offerings in the form of paintings, embroidered items, pottery and the like. In the end I had to ship some things home as there were so many things I just had to have. "
Loosing its traditional charm and becoming another modern shopping street,"Not many traditional handicraft shops are left. The shops are increasing being replaced by cafe, souvenir shops, restaurants, etc Go visit soon before the old charms are all gone.A number of shops there rent out traditional Korean dress for visitors to wear and roam the street. "
SHOP SHOP SHOP,"There are many tourist souvenir shoos that really dont get my attention, but mixed in are many authentic traditional handicraft stores, selling wonderful handmade items. Embroidery, rice paper paintings, inlay boxes, ceramics and clothing. If you look hard you can find high quality items not just tourist junk. There are many street vendors also selling interesting small items and food. Just north of this area before the bukchon hanok village are many excellent shops and restaurants as well. The best pottery KWANG Ju Yo, also a well known jeweler that also makes home decor items and traditional silver boxes and tea pots, Samchung-dong.The streets get very crowded but are well worth the crowd dodging. "
Interesting tourist place with good price too,"We visited Insadong 2 times during our stay in Seoul - both on Saturday morning. We arrived there around 10 am. All of the store were open but not a lot of visitors yet. To me it is the best time to avoid crowds.The whole Insadong area covers a few city blocks with 1 main street and numerous alleys. At the front end of Insadong, there is an information booth. We got a map there which helped us to navigate the area. Some interesting places (e.g. Kimchi Museum, Temple Food restaurant) are not on the main street. The map definitely helps.There are lots of stores and 1 shopping mall that sell all sort of souvenirs and crafts. Do compare the price first as most of the stores sell similar things. We did not bargain at all as all things are with price tags. All the people in the store speak very simple English. There are countless cafe, snack bars and restaurants on the main street and at those alleys. Price of most restaurants is very reasonable. You can have a set lunch for as low as US$7. Coffee, however, is relatively expensive compared to the food - about US$4 - 5 for an Americano or lattee.If you need to use the washroom, you can either visit the shopping mall or the information center in the middle of the main street."
Favorite neighborhood in Seoul ,"I have been visiting Insadong for more than ten years. While it has changed a great deal, it is still a charming and unique neighborhood. Lots of galleries that change exhibits every week so there is always something new to see. Amazing shopping and the places to eat are endless. My favorites are the little places tucked away in the side streets. Unique jewelry in various price points. This has become a very popular place with locals as well as tourists so can be crowded but worth it."
"""Touristy"" but best place to buy souvenirs","Wandering and being lost in the side streets and alleys of Insadong as we searched for eateries, art and gift shops made for lots of steps but some interesting finds in this tourist area of Seoul. We looked for some unique treats to take home and ended up buying a candy called ""Dragon's Beard"". The sample tasted pretty good but wasn't as tasty as expected when eaten at home. We found the biggest selection of souvenirs and gifts at Insadong, but the nicest quality items were in the gift shop of the national museum by Gyeongbokgung Palace."
A tourist spot with shops only,"It is a pedestrian strip with shops selling souvenirs and some traditional Korean products only. However, there are alleys / side streets with many authentic Korean restaurants. some with many years history worth visiting."
Disappearing old shops and uniqueness,"Insadong used to be one of my favorite places in Seoul. Whenever there are new visitors from overseas, I used to bring them to Insadong and they all loved it. But recently, the rents got so high and many shops which were in Insadong for ages moved out of Insadong. Small souvenirs from the shops there now cost fortune. Honestly, Insadong is losing what makes it very special. It's no longer Insadong I used to know.What a shame~"
Great area for arts & crafts,This area is awesome for more arts and craft stuff. Tons of local Korean designers have a shop here. Esp. At the creative shopping center there.Loads of local eats line the alleyways. From set meals to gimbaps. Cafes and tea shops! Don't miss coming here! Easy to get to Bukchon village and Sam Cheong Dong!
Lunch in Insa-dong ,I visited Insa-dong on a day tour. We had our lunch in Insa-dong and the food was absolutely delicious! After lunch we walk for 40 minutes to see the small shops. I recommend lunch in Insa-dong because the food is ultra delicious plus there is also a very popular Ginseng chicken soup shop there!
Older shopping district,"This shopping area is older when compared to Myeodong district. However, there are still plenty of things with reasonable prices to bargain for."
Love the vibe,"Im really glad that our Tour Specialist brought us here though its not part of our itinerary. I would have missed hanjeongsik lunch and other stuff that can be bought here at a cheaper price compared to myeondong though i didnt check out the cosmetics shop (if there was any). If you would prefer more food trip and shopping, this place is highly recommended. Too bad didnt get to stay longer due to time constraints."
"Not bad, but I expected more","Really liked tea house , they have free tastings, tea is very good though. A lot of bars and restaurants, who likes shopping should visit this street. It might be more interesting during the night time "
"Small, quaint tourist area","The street is lined with shops selling crafts, souvenirs, cafes. Pleasant place to spend time at (abt 1-2 hrs). There is poo poo land and poo- related cafes and snacks for those interested. Easy reach with subway (anguk station). Not a big area, but it's close (walking distance) to Bukchon. Hanok Village and Samcheong-do, another two tourist attractions."
it was okay,"suitable for those who wants to buy decorations, souvenirs and art. I am not much of a souvenir person so Insadong wasn't that interesting for me. There was not much clothing stores to shop. Unfortunately there was not much restaurant open when we were there because it was Chuseok. Still the place was crowded."
Street shopping,Long wide street shopping esp for korean house decors. Some clothes shops pricey and you cam also find Korean souvenir items. Good restaurant is G Gip on 12th corner. Long line but it is worth the wait. Koreans eat as early as 5 pm. 
Love love love!,"We fell in love with Insadong the moment we saw the street lined with amazing local art, quaint museums, hip fashion stores, beautiful tea houses, and traditional restaurants that gave you a feel of being transported to another time in Korea. The vibe too is amazing. It's fun, very eclectic, friendly and casual. Ssamzeigil, a mall along Insadong featuring a pretty unique open layout design, features shopping for every age with different price range. There's something for everyone here, and even if you're just there to feel the vibe, it's definitely worth the visit. "
"Food, art, culture and souvenirs","One of the best spots during peak of autumn. Falling ginko leaves made the entrance to the place really magical! I am just not sure if it have the same charm if the trees do not have those dramatic colors.You have to explore the area to find good food. A lot of souvenir shops too. Although it was a busy street, the whole area gives you a feel of their culture and arts."
A fun street to ramble,"Insadong is a shopping and dining street that is interesting to visit and take a leisurely stroll. It is not as active as the Myeongdong area but well worth a visit. We first strolled the street, then went a few blocks to the Top Cloud Cafe which from the 33rd floor provided a wonderful place for lunch and a spectacular view of Seoul."
Today was too crowded,"Considering it’s a holiday, there were so many people in the area that made it difficult to shop or see the different sites."
Lively place with art,"Numerous art galleries, cafes and restaurants. Shops, museums. Lovely place to walk around but today also so many people because of Chuseok, a local thanksgiving holiday"
Full of food in the street,"There are so many Korean food and interesting small performances like making king’s dessert which was really good. Especially with tea,would be betterFor meals and souvenirs,I recommend this place"
Insadong Review,"Easily accessible, enjoyable street for Seoul visitors. Possible to find many interesting things to buy specific from Korea. Also there are many places to eat, drink, rest. One of must-see places in Seoul."
Business trip,Quiet streets depending on which part of insadong u r atNothing much to see reallyBetter visit the other places if u r on short time frame
Souvenir shopping,"We went here to buy souvenirs like shirts, fans, and ref magnets. They sell quality items at a cheaper price. They also give free items when you buy a lot. What I liked about Insadong is that it's not very crowded when we went there and it's clean."
See yellow ginkgo leaves,"Apart from the traditional shops selling tourist souvenirs, there is a shopping complex on the left side of the street which is very interesting. We found some gadget with new designs there. Shopping and eating apart,I enjoyed the yellow ginkgo trees lined along both side of the street during October and November. It is a good photo spot."
Fun Shopping and lunch,"Insadong provides tourist shopping for the usual little things but it also has neat upper end studios, galleries and shops hidden away on the little side streets mostly patronized by locals. There are also all sorts and little restaurants to give you energy for more shopping!"
Shopping delight,"The selection of small shops and galleries here cover most pockets and tastes, and has some very nice things among the tacky souvenirs. Search around, it is worth it"
A place for everybody,"A place where you can meet everyone or look for everything .. souvenirs, antiques or even modern crafts. A fun place to enjoy by just walk around or stop by for cake and coffee.This is a tourist area so you know what crowd situation you will meet."
Souvenirs,"Antiques! Traditional clothing,foods,restaurants,glasses,paintings, drinks,everything! Insadong are everything in korea for souvenirs!Most tourists come and go in this place A cheap and affordable hotels,motels are also here....Sometimes an activity or performances are held here"
Place for all ages,"Had a fun time at Insadong. There's a lot to do and see. There are shops for souvenirs and cafes. We walked around the area and there were a lot of interesting things that you can do: have a sketch of yourself, try street food, be entertained by food servers, listen to musicians, etc. It's a nice place to spend a few hours. "
Traditional but Too Advertised,Insadong has always been one of my favorite places in Seoul. But nowadays too much tourist so everything seems fake. Though you can find some amazing places hidden. My favorite REAL AUTHENTIC tea shop and a few restaurants are hidden in the alleyways and out of sight. Make sure to find those amazing hidden places. 
I ALWAYS take my friends to Insadong Street!,"I always enjoy taking people to Insadong Street & usually tell my friends to refrain from buying souvenirs elsewhere, because this is the best place to shop!You can find anything and everything, from handmade Korean paper, to beautiful pottery, to cloisonné objects, calligraphy accessories, clothing & accessories, quaint handicrafts, tea, sweets & basically a wide variety of Korean-made goods.The area abounds with great restaurants and tea houses. Sometimes you'll be lucky enough to bump into a cultural experience, like dancers or musicians performing, or a calligrapher demonstrating his craft. You really need to allow a few hours minimum to absorb the magic this area has to offer! Also, on my last visit, the latest trend seems to be Hanbok (traditional dress) rental & you'll see loads of (mostly lovely young female) tourists all bedecked, some including hairstyle, matching bag and shoes! It seemed most prevalent among the Japanese, who love a good costume. At any rate, it adds to the charm and historic feel of the area, which is already quite easy to love."
Shopping area,"It is a good place to buy souvenirs. Walk around shops and observe the prices before you buy something, the prices varies at the same type of products."
Good place to buy souvenirs,There is a market here where you can get all your souvenirs. You can find anything here. Try to walk around for a bit because the stores at the main entrance are more expensive than the ones in the market. They ripped me off a couple of times with the prices for some t shirts. I found the same t-shirt in a few other stores way more cheaper. 
Beautiful Shopping Area; check prices,"Tis is a beautiful and safe shopping area. We discovered wildly varying prices for the same items, so shop around and THEN buy. Carry cash because not all places take cards."
Nice plce,It is a nice place with small shops and cafés.It is a lively area.There were lots of tourists and a very colorful shops.We really enjoyed so much there.
Central location with a mix of new and historical buildings,Very cool location to palaces city hall and markets. Many interesting restaurants and shops with local flavour. All of th above are within a reasonable walking distance but thee is good access to the great subway system to be able to visit other parts of Seoul.
Favorite Shopping Place,"We try to visit different shopping areas (Namdaemun, Myeongdong, Dongdaemun, Gwangjang Market), but we always return to Insadong. There is a great variety of stores there, the passage way is wide, so even when crowded one does not feel jammed in, restaurants are great, and there are cultural events held there. We walked from our hotel to Insadong and there were pansori singing and traditional flute and drum music played. Just a great place."
Area with antique art and book stores,"We came here using the subway and exited from Anguk station. There were a number of shops dealing in art and crafts. As we were not art lovers, we just gave this place a short visit."
It has changed...,This used to be the area with many craft stores where the artists made their traditional wares and had a good mix of galleries and artsy shops. But many of the traditional stores have disappeared and are filled with many newer boutigues... Disappointing.
Simple but commercialized neighborhood,Get the authentic Korean feel here in Insadong. Lots of restaurants and cute small shops in the small alleys. Try some Korean dumpings or noodles to end your perfect afternoon stroll.
One of the only two things worthwhile in Seoul,"Seoul is a boring city, nobody would deny that. Insa is the exception, as it is a quite authentic quarter with little restaurants and guest houses. Go into the side streets and enjoy food in a restaurant there."
Beautiful area. Lots of options,The whole area is beautiful. Little alleys that lead to more and more restaurants and cafes. Great atmosphere and a thousand things happening around you. Food available everywhere. Definitely a place to go.
Weekend stay,I stayed here over the weekend on a business trip. It's the perfect location with a lot to do. Make sure to visit the insadong shopping street. There are also tons of restaurants
Good place to buy souvenirs and to taste some local flavors,This area is having so many streets full of souvenir shops and restaurants. Its a good place if one wants to buy some traditional Korean stuffs.
1 day in Seoul Insadong and gyeongbokgung palace,"Insadong is a wonderful part of Seoul to purchase souvenirs, try Korean street foods, listen to live performances, visit tea houses, and meander in the streets! There are many art shops that sell handmade brushes and rice paper. Check out art galleries, see a 14th century Chinese pagoda in the park, and visit the ssamzigil shopping complex. Make it to the top to visit the Poo Cafe. Check the side streets and allies for traditional restaurants. Insadong is within walking distance from the gyeongbokgung palace. "
Nice place to visit,I stayed in Insadong at the Ibis Hotel. They were many small alleys and streets in between the major ones which were often much less traveled and full of people than the big streets so it was almost like a place to get away from the hustle and bustle of Seoul. We found many authentic restaurants and some locally owned themed restaurants (some of which I added on Google Maps) which were often likewise less filled and less busy. It also seems to be a sweet spot in the middle of a great many things that are worth visiting in the area. Plus I can safely recommend the Ibis as a inexpensive but great place to stay.
Upscale-ish walking mall,"Some repeat merchandise for sale (largely in the tourist category), but also a good variety of interesting souvenirs and contemporary items such as jewelry, stationery, and modern art. With a handful of eateries to boot, you could spend a few fun hours here."
Pleasant stroll,"It was very pleasant to walk around the streets, but really hard to find any good food. Ended up eating in really tourist place, big mistake. There are heaps of shops for souvenir hunting. Watch out for the hills they are steep!!!"
SHOPPING,"This place is full of shopping and food shops. there are also many side vendors selling everything from electronic fans, to ice cream and oreo filled pastries with honey."
Cute shopping street,"Close to the N Seoul Tower, this shopping street was on of the nicest ones in Seoul! Lots of vendors and everything from high-end to market traders. Jusrt a nice escape from the traditional shopping malls."
Excellent traditional wares and restaurants,Very pretty area with excellent restaurants. I got a feeling though that they may have different prices for tourists versus locals. I only bought from those whose prices are written on signs so that I know for sure that they are not changed because I was a tourist
Shopping ,This place is very relaxing despite with all the tourist and local shopping and walking around. So many shops and food to choose. I find it relaxing while looking and doing window shopping. Try to go the a small mall where the poop cafe at 4th floor for an experience.
A must visit especially over the weekend!,"Said to be the cultural place of Seoul. This place is the best place to visit during the weekend. One is able to see some old Korean traditions. Street foods are available. If you are lucky, you are also able to see the cultural show on the stress. "
"A quiet, cozy traditional tea house you will like!","Tuck in a small lane just opposite Ssamziegil at Insadong unique arts and craft shopping center is this47th Avenue tea house at Insadong. (address : 47-9, Insadong-Gil, Jongno-Gu, Seoul,).You will enjoy the quiet cozy environment after walking the very interesting arts & crafts shops.Serve a very good variety of hot nourishing tea and also ice cold mocha dessert!Enjoy the traditional Hanok architecture and relax..before heading out for more sight seeing or shopping."
lots of shops and restaurants,"It's a street with shops and restaurants, they also have art and exhibits. My girlfriend recommends the massage place on the 5th floor see pic of there business card"
impressive location which offers locals and tourists many of its attractions,"we toured Insadong and spent hours enjoying what it has to offer: small restaurants and cafes, art galleries, handicrafts, tea shops, handmade paint brushes and art supplies, hanbok rentals, souvenirs and fashionable boutiques. it is a great place to shop as prices are much less expensive than elsewhere. it is less than 10 minutes from the Gyeongbukgun Palace. must visit."
Cool area to stroll around in,"Lots of little shops, cafés, art galleries, independent stores and a nice atmosphere. Start from Jonggak station or from Anguk station if you have been visiting some of the palaces and you want to then eat/ do a bit of souvenirs / gift shopping."
Nice place to eat/shop/stay close to Gyeongbukgun,"My family stay in Insadong over night so that we can go to Gyeongbukgun the next day. It turn out that we made the right decision. The street was clean and full of shops and restaurants and well within walking distance to the palace. We were a bit surprised to see how few street food/night market type eateries there were, however. It wasn't a big deal given how many restaurants there were. Note: almost all the restaurants were Korean. My kids were asking for pasta, but couldn't find any... Will definitely go back again to experience a different season/scenery."
One of my favourite parts of the city,"From shops, to mini dining areas to a number of cultural attactions. You really have to be here and experience it. "
Great area for food and shopping,"We must have spent at least about an entire day here. This area has a lot of shops which are mostly geared towards tourists and general shoppers. You can find all kinds of stuff here from local paintings to jewelry, clothing, antiques and of course small souvenir shops. My favorite here was the food. They have a variety of restaurants and you actually do see a lot of locals eat here. Their food is really good. We tried traditional Korean food here which was good. At the restaurant we went the food was really good but the attitude of the owner and the servers was not very good. The owner of this restaurant did not speak English very well and she was also very abrasive. She did not like people waiting inside the restaurant and instead of politely asking guests to wait outside she would plainly point guests to outside and say outside. My wife has food allergies to soy and Gluten and was asking the server if any of their meals has no soy and is gluten-free and that did not go well. The server first took order from three of us and finally when my wife was asking a few questions the server did not wait to take her order and walked away to greet other guests and never came back and placed the order for three of us with the kitchen and never came back to take my wife's order. My daughters and I ended up eating here and my wife went to another restaurant to get served. When food was brought to table there was no chop sticks and we waited around for at least 15 minutes and finally I got up and went up to the server and asked can we have chop sticks to eat and the server pointed to a small drawer under the table which had all the chop sticks inside and we ended up eating our food a bit cold. Remember couple of things at least from what we have seen, one most Korean restaurants have their chop sticks hidden in a drawer under the table and also you always pay on the way out at the cash register and normally they don't collect payment at the table."
"Wonderful Food, Great Shopping Neighborhood","The perfect neighborhood to browse and shop in - some touristy spots alongside some awesome tea shops, fabric shops, and other boutiques. Definitely a great place to find affordable gifts for friends - or yourself! The Ssamzigiel center is especially fun for those who want to shop in the spiral mini mall."
Fun-tastic day,"Hubby and i had a very interesting day . Initially we wanted to skip this part of town to checkout other places but ended up loving the place and stayed for a few hours. After meeting a friend nearby at a cafe overlooking the palace . We were then advise to checkout the street. Without much thought we agreed for a look around. Ssamziegil was interesting but the insadong street itself was what made an interesting day for us. From people watching, cultural experience , and seeing kids wearing hanboks since its was a summer holiday time was interesting as it gives a bit of an olden time feels. Being as it was our first time in seoul, loving the sound of the beautiful language being spoken all around and its even more fun meeting locals knowing or even speaking or trying to speak the foreigners locals language base on the countries they are from. If here , do explore the small alleys that would/could lead to beautiful teahouses that has a very traditional feel's. PS: some other places tp checkout nearby- bukchon hanok village- tongin market (dosirak cafe)- Gyeongbokgung Palace- Changdeokgung Palace---------------------------------------Tips: do try the mango ice-creams u find form street vendors. Its not really ice cream but truly sweet fresh mangoes that was frozen.. refreshing indeed. Try the tea form the teahouse's and also dont be afraid to approach the kids with hanboks for a picture.. haha they love the attention as much as we love getting a picture with them.. hahah Though the boys were being a bit too macho.."
My favorite neighborhood in seoul,"Love this area in seoul! Very artistic neighborhood with nice boutique, galleries and restaurants. You can visit the Yogyesa temple"
Popular,"Popular district for many good options for shopping and dining, close to the downtown area. Crowded sometimes."
Very agreeable to strill around ,"Insadong is close to the Gyeongbokgung Palace and thus easy to combine both the visits. At the extreme end, there is also a very big local market, very interesting to visit.One can find there all kind of stuff:food, clothes, local stuff"
Charming Beautiful and Culturally Rich,"Charming and authentic, Insa-dong is a small enclave of beautiful and tranquil neighborhoods with narrow alleys and full of Korean essence. We had time to kill before our tour of the nearby palace, so we decided to explore this gorgeous place. We found this area absolutely delightful. Full of charming little cafes, art galleries and shops, and unlike busy Seoul where people are less friendly and more distrustful, people made us feel welcome and comfortable. From store owners and staff to locals on their way somewhere, people greeted us in peace and well wishes. What a contrast! Even though we had the tickets bought for our tour and we were all set to go, this culturally rich neighborhood stole our heart that day to the point of choosing to forget the tour in order to stay. It was the best decision, and one we have not regretted. We loved all the rows of cute stores and traditional shops displaying all the traditional Korean folk art and crafts, pottery, dishes, tea sets and ceramics, tea houses, OMG don't go there if you love teas! We stayed for hours and eventually got hungry. So, we entered a tiny little cafe tended by one single little old lady. She was the hostess, the server and the chef, and personally invited us to one of the most memorable dining experiences we had in Korea. We still have no clue what we ate, we spoke little to no Korean and her English was nill. So, in what appeared as a recommendation, she went straight to the kitchen to labor to produce the most delicious meal we ate there. She kept coming to our table to keep us company and to tell us all kinds of stories that we did not understand. Yet, what we did understand was her beautiful soul, her charming and lovely personality that made our hearts melt with love for her. That day in Insa-dong will for ever be one of my favorite memories of any trip I have ever taken. Do yourself a favor, go! You too will fall in love."
"Local arts, crafts and food","Try to discover small streets around this Main Street with lots of small local restaurants, try cold kimchi soup!"
Great Place,We visited here to get some good food and buy some great souvenirs. This place is clean and service around this place is great. It is little touristy but it's worth it.
Touristy but do it,"My hotel was near here so I visited this area several times. Lots of tourists but good place for food and some things to bring back for friends (tea, art, candy etc). Go down the side streets too as some of the best and most interesting restaurants are there. Nearby the main Insadong pedestrian walk closer to Jongno 3 metro station there are streets that offer a bit more ""local"" restaurants and drinking haunts."
Beautiful Insadong,"The real traditional Seoul culture. You could spend hours or days just wandering the alleys and streets of Insadong and see traditional art, paper, calligraphy and culture."
Fun shopping area ,Good variety of shops and eating places. Nicer stores mixed with lower end tourist types. Also some artistic shops with beautiful jewelry. 
Good ,Pros 1. Many free galleries 2. Performances on the street 3. Street foods 4. Korean traditional restaurants 5. Tea shops Cons1. Most of cheap souvenirs are made in China 2. Very busy 
Charm and people watching,"You could buy absolutely nothing, or gifts. You could have a beer, dinner of many kinds - Korean, fusion, pizza, French. Lots of hipsters I some streets as well as families and friends out enjoying life. "
self sufficient,"a small street but sufficient for shopping, eating and even accomodation. a very convenient place to be at in Seoul"
Wide options,"منطقة بالقرب من ميونج دونج وكبيرة ممكن تاخذ وقت ، ممتلئة بكافيهات ومحلات ، لا يفوتكم مقهى كوفي سميث ، الوافل لذيذ جدا والمكان مطل اطلالة حلوةThis area is close to myeongdong shopping street, it has many cafes and shops. Coffee smith there has a great view."
A must see but be careful what you buy. ,I like the street and there is quite a bit to do and see. BUT everything is way over priced. We bought a small bell and a small jewelry box. The next day we were in Iteawon and the same bell and jewelry box were exactly half the price. I would recommend visiting with buying your souvenirs somewhere else.
"Culture, art and crafts, real South Korean","Insa-dong Street is one of the most memorable attractions in Seoul and represents the Korean traditional culture and crafts. Stores in Insa-dong (from cheap to very expensive) specialize in a wide variety of goods that can only be purchased or in Korea: hanbok , hanji , traditional teas, pottery, and folk crafts. Great to walk around and spend a few houres there!"
Excellent Place to stay and visit in Seoul,"We stayed in Insadong and found it was the best location to walk to attractions plus it was the best neighbourhood for food, souvenirs and handmade handicrafts. Food ranged from restaurants to street stalls - the best! I would highly recommend anyone to stay here - we stayed at the Orakai Suites - fabulous!"
Nice stroll,"Nice street to stroll in the afternoon, especially after 2 pm.as the buildings shadow cast on the street make it not too hot and pleasant to walk or have an.afternoon tea there. The street has a good atmosphere but nothing much to shop. Mainly are souvenir stores for tourists. There are a few of good vegetarian restaurants nearby however. "
Best place in korea,"Place with lovely Cafes, art and beautiful autumn trees in yellow to welcome you. Although touristy but great place to hang about."
Fascinating and beautiful area,"Lots of shops and art galleries. Higher quality stuff than other shopping streets and more handmade art, etc. Beautiful setting and people watching as well."
Good find,"Great little find if you want to stroll around traditional Korean craft shops, also restaurants, cafes and street vendors so you won't go hungry.Good place to come to if your looking for a that souvenir to take home.I would recommend to download the Kakao Metro app, great little app that tells you exactly which train to catch and when to get off for anywhere you want to go in Korea using the subway system. Also buy a T Money card to travel with, this is a cheaper option to travel on the subway, taxi etc ,and you can use them in some fast food restaurants. Just load them with credit at any 7 eleven or charging points in the subways."
Touristic place,"If you are the kind of person who loves to buy "" souvenirs"" and some things from the place, this is the place to go.The street is picturesque and you could find many ""celadons"" and little things to buy. A place where one could spend one or two hours."
Traditional street,"Lots of little stores selling souvenirs , designer style clothes and traditional gifts. Nice to walk up and down looking at everything . We also had dinner here in an upstairs restaurant that served BBQ fish! Excellent after a long day of walking around!"
Precious and Traditional Culture and Crafts,"Insa-dong Street , located in the heart of the city is one of the most memorable attractions in Seoul and represents the focal point of Korean traditional culture and crafts. Stores in Insa-dong specialize in a wide variety of goods: hanbok (traditional clothing), hanji (traditional paper), teas, pottery and folk arts. There are also cafes, restaurants and galleries. Take Line 3 to Anguk Station Exit 6 or Subway Line 1 to Jonggak Station Exit 3. "
Nice streets ,Lots to see. Shops selling special Korean paper. Lots of shops selling tourist items and gifts. Lots of restaurants and cafes. Bought 'dragon beard' candy. Very entertaining too as they shop how they make this candy. Enjoyed our day.
Great area to explore,Found this area much better for shopping then Myeongdong. More traditional goods and so may great little places to eat. 
Found a few interesting/upscale boutique clothing shops,"It is one of the stops on City Bus Tour route #A, it is worth a stop as it has lots of souvenirs, crafts and boutique clothing shops. This place is also about 15-20 minutes walk from Myeongdong, so ideally take a late afternoon stroll of Insadong then head to Myeongdong night market to immerse yourself in Korea culture."
Loved shopping and found many interesting things here!,"We were planning to visit Insadong, for experiencing their tea houses as well as some interesting shopping in the area. There's a lot to see and buy in this area, and the tea houses are a memorable experience. Recommended for a short visit (couple of hours)!"
Touristy but interesting,"Insadong is a main tourist destination in Seoul. The main street is filled with restaurants and cafes, and is probably a good place to head on your first few days in Seoul, as people are used to tourists and tolerant of language differences. Restaurants here are relatively expensive compared to other places in Seoul, but are still pretty cheap. "
Plenty to offer,"We stayed in an AirBnB in this area, so spent a lot of time here. Lots of interesting shops and galleries to browse, tea houses, restaurants and hanbok rental places."
"Interesting place, lots of things to see","Lots of things to see and buy. Mostly frequented by tourist but just the same, some prices here are cheap if you are able to compare to some areas if not cheap, just the same"
Just another shopping area,I thought this area was pretty generic. Just lots of stores and restaurants. Worth going once while you're in Seoul. 
Shop Til You Drop,"I love strolling the streets here looking at the various shops. There is a lot of repetition among the shops - you find the same touristy crap out front of every other store front, however there are some fun gems hidden among the mass produced money sinks. There is a whole building dedicated to arts and they have a basement level where you can make your own crafts. This is not just for kids - I mean it's aimed at children, but I'm in my 30s and I had a blast making my own soap and would have done even more fun crafts had my husband not reminded me that we had to fit everything into small suitcases that were already pretty full. "
Nice place to shop and people watch,Insadong is a better place to shop and people watch than the crazy Myeongdong area. It also has some great galleries with beautiful art. Go and spend a couple of hours wandering the streets.
Beautiful street,We stayed in Saerim Hotel which located on this street but a bit hidden in between the shops. Don't forget to visit the Dynamic Maze & PooPoo Land. Great experience if u are someone who enjoyed a bit of excitement & thrill AND ofcoz in a fit condition. Haha..
Must visit,Sick of cheap crap or expensive shops you get in every city? Then Insadong is perfect for you. Lots of artist shops and stores with quality good as well as your ubiquitous tourist shops and excellent restaurants. It is our favourite shopping area in Seoul. It remains me of Portland with small shops selling select items. Fun to wander through. 
Stroll at Insadong,I love Insadong area because of the shop stalls along the streets and the street foods. If you want to buy something for your friends wayback home just go and shop at Insadong. You can just walk from Buckon Village and Gyeongbukgong Palace. Just ask for direction from the people you meet.
Cool shopping street with many food options,"Whilst the Insa-dong area is focussed on tourists it has many great little shops, some with the usual touristy items such as t-shirts, fans, pictures etc but there are also many cool little craft shops. Along with the tourist shops many great food places have sprung up. To find some hidden gems explore all the little alleyways and side streets. Well worth a visit here to pick up some souvenirs and take a bite to eat. "
Pretty shopping district ,This area is worth visiting as it features pretty and artistic shops rather than global brands. There are good places to eat and it is a pleasant area to walk through. 
Fun street!,"Busy and teeming with shoppers, dining and musical performances from Korean traditional song/dance to modern musical. "
Quite a shopping place...,"Another typical shopping district. Some travel magazines said it was somehow artistic and special, but I did not think so or realize anything especially attractive."
Good area with korea ambience,Not far from central. this area is good to visit specially for bars and restaurants in Korean style. some shops for souvenirs. I wont say it is a must visit place. you may visit if you passing from this area.
culture bath,"i love the teahouses and small restaurants in the alley ! very cultural place to visit...recommended !! must walk into those alleys to find those traditional teahouses & guaranteed you would feel so different , away from the bustle of the main street !"
Short walk from Changdeokgung Palace,"After visiting the palace, we used Google map to guide us to Insadong. You can also print out a map before your trip if you prefer something bigger than a phone. :)The walk was about 15 minutes at most. There is a tourist booth with college students to answer any questions. We walked down the street on one side and walked up on the other side so we won't miss anything. There are many souvenir shops which was something we were not able to find in Myeongdong or Dongdamaen. The prices are more or less all the same, I know because I went in every shop to compare prices lol, for the same keychains, small hand crafted coin purses, bookmarks, and letter openers. The price difference is so minute it's not worth your time comparing. I did try to bargain at the few stores I made purchases from, and was successful. The discounts were small but better than nothing. :) Many restaurants or snack shops , tea houses, pharmacies, arts and crafts stores. It was not as crowded, a nice little break from all the sightseeing and shopping. Get a drink or popsicle, sit down on the bench and enjoy !"
Well preserved part of Seoul,"Pleasant to walk around and full of restaurants, tea houses and art and gift shops of various types. It felt a bit touristy for my taste but was relatively relaxed and a contrast to the big pacy centre of the city. Be warned restaurants seem to close early here - we got caught out on our first night when we checked into our hotel from the airport at gone 8pm, virtually everything had closed by the time we went out in search of dinner just after 9pm. "
Seoul has many foreigners,"A growing number of foreigners are enjoying Korean food, music, and movies. The entire area is filled with a lot of culture and art. Insa-dong is a blend of modern and traditional things. Insa-dong is a very popular area in Seoul. BUT! I wouldn't visit this place that if I was you. This street isn’t so special any more. "
Amazing,"Amazing place to view commercial signs such as starbucks or baskin robbins in Korean, also shop and eat traditional Korean things. Ssamjigil is a great place to buy gifts from independent vendors."
Korean cultire,It's a nice place with quaint shops where you can buy Korean products. Nice strolling around the area and watching how Dragon beard is made 
Great place to wander shop and eat,It's a mix between modern and old. The side streets and steps are great to explore while the Main Street has a mix of modern and old. Great place to eat and the metro stop is right there it's worth a few hours or more to explore
Nice atmosphere ,"Nice place with old buildings, restaurants and cafes are not big but nice and cozy. They also sell small cute souvenirs. "
I love Insadong art street!,I would like to walk around for shopping. You can find many great stuffs here. There are so many restaurants hid inside ally. Don'ts forget stop at lovely tea cafes. 
Insadong - great shopping place,"I was in Seoul only for one week but I visited this place 4 times during this week. This was great place for looking for some souvenirs and some Korean traditional stuff. I like this place very much and I went here 2 evening just walking and observing. There is a lot of very nice restaurants in near small food streets.I bought a lot of souvenirs for my family there like hand fan, yellow cooper rings and other stuff, hand made old paper cup, decorating tag, tea set etc..."
Many unique shops and services,Lots of restaurants. Street vendors and shops. Convenient location near the palace. My favorite stop was Dr Fish. Pay a small fee and stick your bare feet into an aquarium with fish which eat the dead skin off your feet. Tickles a bit but your feet end up smooth and clean
A unique charm,Insadong is a mixture of old and new. It is a charming street including the many side allleys which can have cafes and boutiques side by side. There are shops which can rent out hanboks and also those which sell clothings with contemporary designs. The many art galleries make this place a must for those interested in paintings.There are many shops selling souvenirs and silver accessories. There were many designs which I didn't see in other places like myeondong or express bus terminal.Insadong is worth taking the time to stroll along and enjoy the sights and sound of old and new korea.
Not really sure why this is a destination...,"Maybe I was missing something, but I wasn't such a fan of this area. There were just an awful lot of tea shops. I went during the day though. Perhaps it's better at night?"
Shopping excursion,"My mother and I went here together and we absolutely loved it! We had visited a couple of the other markets together and they were somewhat of a letdown because we weren't really looking for that department store feel or the super back alley pawn shops that were behind the department stores. We wanted the in between that was street vendors and street level shops with decent wares at decent prices and that is precisely what Insadong was. It had great things to buy and look at and it was just a lovely place to walk around. The street was blocked off so there was only foot traffic, very few cars. Just beware that the stores close around 8:30 p.m. or so! "
LOVED IT!,"If you can only go to one market this is it! We actually went twice we loved it so much. Fun people, great shopping , great food. It was wonderful"
antique place,An interesting shopping place where many good and interesting antiques are found ... there can also rent korean clothes (hanbok) and are used to take pictures around insadong market
Absolutely love this place!,"If I had to pick one place to visit in Seoul for food and shopping combo, it would be Insadong. I love this place - there's a nice blend of traditional Korean and more modern style of food, music, shopping goods, and architecture. Explore the side streets for more restaurants/cafe, galleries, and near by Bukchon hanok village. "
One of my favourite places ,Many would agree that this is the rafts and cultural hub of this fantastic city. You could spend days here on end and never run out of exciting things to explore. If you like crafts and tradition then this is the place. Don't feel shy to haggle for a good bargain. I got myself a jade turtle and a bronze tiger sculpture at a bargain. There are also some nice restaurants here and there us also the Jogyesa tremble nearby. Love this place. 
If your looking for korean souvenirs insadong is the place,"When you are looking for a nice place to buy korean souvenirs go to insadong.Try also the poop waffle like bread, its very chewy and not sweet. A lot of souvenir items can be bought to this place you can spend 1 hour to 2 hours max at this place"
disappointing after the hype,"May be i missed something, but it was pedestrian in every sense of the word. You know it has lost anything quaint or charming when there is a starbucks cafe as you enter the street. Rather uninspiring collection of shops selling either tourist garbage or otherwise same old stuff as any where else."
Give it a try,"Visited this street in May. This market is one of major tourist attraction. You can buy clothing, souvenirs, and food as well. Walk-able from the palace. Dont forget to try Temple food restaurant in this area."
Good if looking for touristy Seoul and souvenirs,"Other reviews seem to describe this area as either ""quaint and charming"" on one hand, or ""touristy / souvenir-y"" on the other; I would lean toward the touristy end. More westerners here than in some other places like Gangnam, though about the same or perhaps fewer as around Myeong-Dong. So, yes, there are people walking around in traditional costume, but it seems like a show for the non-Korean visitors. There are not many big chain stores/restaurants - primarily small shops selling handicraft souvenirs and Korean restaurants, so it won't feel like Myeong-Dong or Gangnam in that regard. Come here if you're looking for ""Korean"" bric-a-brac. There are some art galleries as well."
Better than Myeongdong! ,"The Over-all vibe for me is better than Myeondong. Lots of Shops, good varieties & very inviting store owners! Array of street foods, Lots of locals around, you'll get to see part of locals daily lives. More locals than tourist. "
Nice local eateries off the main street ,We stayed in a service apartment minutes away by foot from Isadong. Enjoyed strolling and browsing along the main street. Discovered nice and reasonably priced local eateries in the narrow alleys off the Main Street. 
Definitely worth a visit!,"Lovely place to wander around and get lost amongst the little lanes branching off the Main Street.This is the craft / cultural centre of Seoul so lots of little shops selling handicraft, pottery, souvenirs, etc. plenty of quaint cafes and restaurants too to satisfy your hunger. I really enjoyed the few hours I spent exploring the area.. But did not buy much as things seem rather overpriced due to its popularity with tourists."
Unusual arty shops,NIce area to browse arts and handicrafts instead of the usual commercial streets filled with beauty accessories
ok,"It's pretty near the main palace and the folk museum. I went there for a tour of insadong and then went to the temple, palace, and museum. Wouldn't go just for it."
Another shopping district,"This was promoted in the tourist brochure as a street showcasing traditional Korean culture, but I find that this is another shopping street lined with the usual shops in another touristy district. Perhaps my assessment has been clouded as this is the place I dropped by after visiting the Bukchon Hanok Village, which is definitely a district with more character and personality. Nothing here is cheap, and even if you have no intention to shop, stopping by one of the cafes for a traditional Korean tea while people-watching will dent your wallet."
Central base to explore with everything,"70 minute bus ride from Incheon airport or easily accessible by the many metro stations nearby. This place is filled with restaurants, tea houses, tourist shops, bars and coffee shops. Pleasant atmosphere and excellent base to explore the rest of city.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
The art street of Seoul,"If you're looking into the different arts and crafts, you can find it here! - I had my 'dojang' or korean seal made here. It's 30,000 KRW but it's definitely worth it! I made them write both my korean and english name in the seal. You can also get it 15 minutes after having it personalized. - In the insadong street, you can find different stores with korea items you can bring home to your families.- There are restaurants but they are quite expensive, so make sure you find one that fits your budget!- There are girls who roam around wearing the hanbok or the traditional korean dresses, which YOU can also rent and wear around!- highly accessible to 2 main streets!- there are smaller streets you can go into that have different stores (restaurants, pot/ceramic stores, wood stores etc.) that you can go around to. "
A bit stale now,"We have always gone here when in Seoul for reasonably priced souvenirs. This time we noticed the prices were not that cheap. If you are OK with more of the real Korean market feel, shopping in the Namdaemun Market (near the south gate) is another option. "
Lovely street ,It's a lovely street to walk on...eat food....visit tea house....shopping....I went there 2 times and loved it so much.I recomend visiting this street....alone or not....it's a experience you don't want to miss 
Love Insadong,Walked around all day to explore Insadong. Had a great lunch at a local restaurant recommended by our tour guide and enjoyed local dishes.
Loved Insadong!,"My husband and I stayed 1 week in an apartment located on the edge of Insadong. We loved wandering around there, going in galleries, eating and drinking tea! The main street can get very crowded with shoppers and tourists but just off the main street you will find quiet alleys lined with (mostly) reasonably priced and delicious locally-run restaurants serving traditional foods: bidimbap, noodles, dumplings, rice cakes, congee, BBQ etc. There are also a couple of nice tea houses, one with outdoor seating in a garden that is surprisingly secluded and calming... On the main street, if you can ignore the crowds and street vendors, you will find interesting art galleries and stores selling beautiful handcrafted items along with some tourist trap places you will probably want to avoid."
Interesting visit,"This place is pretty interesting as there are plenty of souvenir shops and also modernised hanbok dresses for sale. And not forgetting hanbok rentals. There are plenty of cosmetic shops too and also there is an interesting shop that sells korean handmade scrubs. This shop also sells cute nut crackers and are not very expensive as souvenirs. Its really near where we rented our airbnb stay, probably 6 or 7 minutes away."
Beautiful place,"Crowded, lots of street vendors. From Korean fashion to antiques. Had difficulty finding a public restroom. "
Go if you are into arts,"Primarily an arts and crafts street but with multiple shops selling the same thing or offering the same service. However, there is a hidden awesome bingsu shop in this street."
Loved Insadong,"Having been both an artist community and market for centuries, Insadong is a must see in Seoul. There are many shops with hand made crafts of different varieties, as well as tea shops, clothing shops, stamp shops, simply lots and lots of shops. My son found works of art to bring home with him, I found souvenirs for my friends and there were many more options. In many of the small shops, you can look inside and see the proprietor working on a piece of art. I do wish I had more time to shop for clothes; the clothes shops were enticing. The restaurants in Insadong are less expensive than some other areas of Seoul and the food leans toward locally owned Korean tea houses and noodle shops. Another plus in my opinion. Don's miss spending at least a little time in Insadong. Do check out the side streets as well as the main pedestrian street. "
Great shopping,Terrific shopping street for all those things you really never knew you needed. This is where you can find all the local handicrafts.
Good tourist shopping,"We spent an afternoon wandering the shops in the insadong markets. A good mix of ""real"" shops and tourist shops. Good souvenirs and house wares can be found, along with ornaments and many others things you can take home.There are street food stalls, but I wouldn't say the good is the main attraction here."
Just Expensive Western Food,Not sure why people who come to Korea will go to this international town. It's basically the same food that you will get in Europe or US for a lesser price. Better off eating Korean food than the expensive food here.
Insadong has changed.,Insadong is no longer an artists' enclave. It is now filled with cheap Korean trinkets. You can still get good food and some art materials.
Great for shopping,It was only until it was too late that I made a mistake with Insadong - I thought the main street was were it was all at. Wrong. As well as so many interesting shops on the main street there are a lot of alleys with more shops. Allow yourself about 3 hours to browse the entire area and don't stick to the main street....which I did!
"Little alleys, street foods, souvenirs...",Insadong-samcheongdong-gyeongbok palace-gwanghwamun can be grouped together. They are all walking distance from each other. 
The Art Capital of Seoul,"I LOVE INSADONG. Heralded as the Art Capital of Seoul, this area is probably my favorite landmark out of all the places we visited last week. This area is quiet without being boring, and is lively without being rowdy. People aren't pushing you, and you don't feel any pressure to buy anything. Walk around and simply enjoy the ambiance of this perfect mix of old and new. And it truly lives up to its name as the art capital, because there are art galleries, calligraphy shops, and other art supply stores EVERYWHERE. This is also a great place to buy souvenirs for friends and family, because they offer the same things as other highly commercialized places for cheaper prices. Street food is also great too! 1000-2000 won only!!! Must-visit is the Ssamziegil Mall, which is half mall half boutique stores. This place is a HAVEN for Instagrammers, millennials, and anyone generally looking for something interesting in Seoul. (Tip: The infamous Poop Cafe is here, as well as the Wall of Love in the top floor) Other things worth getting here are the 16,000 strings of honey wrapped around ground nuts like mochi cakes (we bought our box from 2 very entertaining brothers!!!), and art supply materials if you're into painting and calligraphy. "
Poop Bread,"Come here for the poop Bread and Cafe about poop. The ""dragon beard candy"" guys will also give you a show on how they make the candy."
A Short Walk from Bukchon Village,This busy area is full of shops and restaurants tucked away in side streets. We were there during the holidays for Buddah's birthday and it was buzzing with people wearing traditional dress (it can be hired by anyone for a couple of hours or more). Very colourful. 
Good for souvenirs,Some great Korean handicrafts and souvenirs. Cafes were overpriced but nice to watch the people go by. 
Not so crazy,"Not sure if it was the time of day (around 3pm), but we enjoyed walking around without the hustle & bustle. There were beautiful ceramics. And I bought myself an eel leather wallet - apparently only made in Korea!"
Good place to buy traditional souvenirs and enjoy eateries.,"It's a good place to buy traditional souvenirs and eat varieties of korean foods (including traditional teas and dessers!) Especially I recommend old tea houses and traditional dessert shops around the town. Most of them are using the old Hanok's building, so you can enjoy your tea in the peaceful and silent Hanok. ;-) Some say Insa-dong has now become too commercial, but it's still one of the best places to feel traditional Korean mood. "
Visit the alleys that are by the main street,"It's a great place to get souvenirs for friends and family. There are lots of little shops along the way that will sell keychains, bookmarks and Korean style chopsticks etc. Do visit the little alleyways by the main street, there are locals restaurants and traditional teahouses hidden in there. Have a cup of tea and a traditional Korean snack in the teahouses before you leave. "
Jeju Tea Garden Worth Visiting,I bought 4 bottles of green tea powder after trying out the green tea Latte. Its good! You have two cosy levels of sitting area for you to enjoy the tea and Bingsu. 
A feel of traditional Korea...,"As the pace of development increases sharply in the past 7 years, Insadong is the few places left in Seoul that gives you a feel of traditional Korea. You will be able to get lots of traditional Korean souvenirs in Insadong. Most restaurants operates in traditional buildings. Prices can be more expensive than other places by 20% for the same type of food. There are however, more variety of Korean food in Insadong than places like Dongdaemun."
Many small souvenirs shops for tourists,I mainly walked on the Main Street and the shops are mostly selling small souvenirs. I think it is good for buying small gifts here. There are a lot of Korean skincare shops in here too.
Do come and explore!,"Interesting area to explore, to dine, to people watch or for taking a walk, especially after dinner. It's a popular area anytime of the day with many choices for dining."
Old town,"Discover many things are cheaper here, compared to Myeong dong. Quite enjoyable. I have green tea ice cream at a famous green tea shop there."
Touristic but authentic,"It is a really nice place to walk around. You can find different places where they sell typical Korean souvenirs but also some design galleries and stores with really nice items. On the streets close to this area, there are good places to have lunch for a good prica"
Insa-dong perfect for paper and seal,"having my korean mother and family living in seoul, i love to stroll in insadong and buy souvenirs, traditional korean paper items and seal with name (you choose the stone and they engrave your name on it straight away). As i understood, Koreans do not have the notion of touristy. For instance, my korean mother was scared in Venice when we went for a stroll and there were so few tourists on the street ! As an industrialized country and OECD member, prices are in Korea (and in Seoul) generally very similar at the level in Europe ! "
Lively,There are always some live performances there whether it is a jazz band or some traditional Korean dance...
Stroll and see what you like,"It nice to go to this place after a long walk at nearby palaces and hanok villages. There are restaurants and food stalls. Try some street food. Then, enjoy visiting some of the art galleries if you are interested about paintings . If you want, choose some souvenir items here. "
Good quality craft and souvenir shopping,"Insadong was a great combination of craft/souvenir shopping, tea houses, places to eat, and galleries. I have already had 2 fabulous meals there, bought super souvenirs and had the best experience - which involved buying a new handbag, and leaving all my jewellery in the old handbag at the shop. Naturally, when I realised, I returned the next day; I was recognised on sight (!!) and she raced to the back of the shop to retrieve not just my jewellery but several special pens that I didn't even realise I'd also lost!"
Insa dong! a lovely area or neighbourhood!,"Insa dong, an area or neighbourhood that is filled with little and bigger shops that sell and produce Korean arts and crafts. Huge paint brushes that are locally made. Some so big that you can use them to write poetry with water on the pavement . Stores where you can find old books and paper, places where you can try on traditional Korean clothes and have you picture taken all dressed up. Places where big and small drums are made and many more traditional objects. this area is a good place for tourists to find real Korean souvenirs."
Nice place for shopping ,This was a pleasant shopping area with interesting stores and restaurants but not a must see. There were street vendors selling interesting things and prices were average but there was nothing special here.
nice but not extraordinary,"Expected to see more artistic shops. But most of them were more like gift shops. Did manage to find a few nice art shops, so that was nice. A couple of hours would be plenty to see this place."
"A nice walk, some good shops - we prefer Myeongdong though","This is quite a fun neighborhood. For the most part it consists of one big - mostly traffic free - street with some interesting side lanes.Also you can spot quite a good amount of visitors dressed in traditional Hanbok clothes.Compared to Myeongdong this is more quiet and has a bit more space to walk. It is completely different, also when it comes to the shops. Most shops here are on the arts and crafts side. We bought some nice kitchenware here as well. And we were lucky to catch some traditional dance show (free) in one of the side lanes. Besides that there's a good amount of interesting restaurants (for good prices). And the carts selling the boiled bugs....which is totally touristy and you won't find them anywhere except in tourist areas. There's also the famous Ssamziegil Mall, which honestly was a bit underwhelming.It is a fun little area, not far away from the palace, which makes a good little walk. But Myeongdong was a place we never got enough of and we walked every night...this place here was fun. But enough to have a walk or two.A must-visit nonetheless.Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
Best Shopping Experience in Asia!,"I shopped in Insadong three times during my two stays in Seoul. I loved the selection of handicrafts, and the pottery selection was phenomenal. Prices were very good as well."
Fun shopping area,"We had so much fun in Insadong. We went there several times when we were in Seoul. My favorite restaurant was down a little alley way. It was a dumpling restuarant. Not far from the Trick Eye Museum. They had sweet and sour mandu, Yum. We couldn't find it anywhere else in Korea. We went back a second time just to have this wonderful dish. We shopped for various things in the area. Many tourist shops. Everything was clean. "
Nice shopping area !!!,European style shopping area with lot of designer stores . Nice walk as well. Good place to stroll and do some shopping 
Best prices that I found,Lots of nice shops for clothes and traditional Korean items. Good prices and easy walking. Food and drink places as well as arts and crafts and antiques. 
Shopping street ,Lots of side roads and a main shopping street . A few art galleries . And places to eat inc Indian restaurant . Avoid the cheaper eating places - the small of the food is bad . You get what you pay for ! There is too much meat in Korea but there are some alternatives here . 
Very interesting,"Yes, a lot of repeated shops but varied. Visited on the weekend and had some shows and bands. Along with the shops, had street food. Walking distance from Hotel Lotte and adjacent to the palace.You could combine a visit to the Palace and Insadong"
Insadong,Just go strolling and looks for small souvenir for friends and walk in to the small food stalls and looks at the delicious food being prepared in front of you.
Interesting,"Spent a relaxing time there browsing around. Interesting little shops. Couldn't find the restaurant I was looking for, but walked into a delightful Korean style tea house, and was not disappointed."
Great day,Fun place to visit. Lots of shops and restaurants and walking distance to some historical sites. We enjoyed our morning here. 
Artistic and shopping street,"We stayed in a hotel at Jongnogu (near the City stream), so could walk to Insa-dong for 10mins only.There is a main street is Insadong-gil, which is connected to a multitude of alleys that lead deeper into the district, with modern galleries, fashion and tea/coffee shops. we realized that stuffs selling here seem a bit expensive than others area, so just walked to see around and enjoyed the contemporary atmosphere here."
Nice different visit,"Avoid Fridays as the many occasion we went, it is a time where schools seemed to bring their students on field trips.Not an issue but it does makes the place just that crowded.I would spent time on traditional tea houses there. No favorites but just try, they are all decent and an experienced with the nice teas and good snacks.There are many souvenir shops, I am not a fan as they are more small gifts, but if you are after good travel souvenirs, do look further than those small shops lined with the more common stuffs.Ssamziegil mall is a must go. The small shops within sells many nice goods that you can bring home. Basement has an area where you can take part in workshops and make something local. Tax refund is downstairs too.Behind the mall, there are many many good food places. Don't forget, it can be a good half day, but take time to enjoy a nice dumpling soup, Korea tea and snack."
Place to Find Traditional Korean Craft Work and Such,"Kind of a norm place, no really big attractions anywhere. Mainly shops on both sides selling traditional Korean crafts, calligraphy brushes etc. Some food here and there and in the alleys, need to speak Korean to get some really good service..."
Souvenirs yet expensive,"There are a lot of good finds in this long alley . Restaurants are also located here . However, prices are more expensive in this area. Insadong tends to be crowded during weekends as locals and foreigners flock in here. Traditional tea places and Korean dining may be experienced here. It's a walking distance from Anguk station exit 5."
korea's souvenirs haven,place where you can see different kinds of handicrafts and local souvenirs. Street foods around this area is a must try too.
Great spot,Great night life and buzzing atmosphere. Go hang out around here for dinner and enjoy walking the streets afterwards
Preferred shopping area.,"Great and buzzing shopping area. Very busy and full. Lots of traditional handcraft and art shops to choose from and very good prices. Great little eating places, teahouses or coffee shops to choose from. Recommend as a must on a visit to Seoul."
The Happening Street,So many entertainment during weekend. A street full with culture and arts. Beautiful concepts and so many things to buy and adore.
They have everything :),"Nice place to relax, from cafes, tea houses and restaurant. This is a place if you like to chill and eat or even check out some souvenirs. Would definitely visit again."
Simple and easy,"A simple and short street with traditional and non-traditional handicrafts, cafes, and snacks. Traditional costumes can be rented here as well and is within walking distance to the grand palace. Nice place to chill away a couple of hours."
Great Shopping and Eating Area.,"Insa-dong is a wonderful experience. The area has the typical tourist items, but on the side streets are many antique shops, galleries, and restaurants tucked away from the main street shops. A trend in Seoul is to rent traditional clothing for 2 or 4 hours. Mainly teenagers are doing this. There are some very nice silver and gold jewelry artisans on the side streets. At one end of the street is a park with a 15th century, 10 story pagoda incased in glass and steel. The park is an excellent place to people watch and public restrooms are easily found. "
Wanderlust,"I love the street food in Insadong, a lot of dainty shops. Traditional stuff are abundant in this area. A good place for sightseeing."
Better than Roppongi or Wan Chai - Maybe!!,"Lovely rabbit warren of themed bars, boutique wineries and pre-clubs. I don't know much about Korea, but I'm pretty sure this is where it's happening. A younger seen, ranging between mid 20's to early 40's, with loud music and upbeat ambiance. One of the best night outs I've had in Asia, ever!!"
Do not miss it,"This is a very interesting area which includes shops (arts/crafts/souvenirs), tea houses, restaurants and everything in between. English is limited, but overall the vendors compensate that with their kindness. However, you should be prepared to bargain over the sticker prices!"
"A Non-Korean, Korean Walking Street","After experiencing the pedestrian-friendly street of Hongdae, Insadong felt more like a street made specifically for tourists. Every store is a souvenir shop or a chain establishment of some sort, and the majority of people there are foreigners. Despite this, it is a fun street to hang out for a few hours."
an interesting place,"the place that i will come again if i travel Seoul.you can find everything includes fashion,foods,souvenir in this street."
Tourist trap but for good reason,It's widely touted as a must visit place and for good reason because it's so close to so many other cultural attractions and has itself lots of culturally focused and specific stores that may not be selling elsewhere. Definitely stroll down the wide main street but also check out the smaller side lanes where quieter little shops reside.We randomly stumbled across a banner for Dr Fish with The Foot Shop (a local Korean chain offering pedicures and massage services) and went for it. It took a little while but we eventually found the right building and went up the elevator to a lovely and inviting spa where it cost 9000 won per person. I'm extremely ticklish but eventually I relaxed enough to stop tensing up and it was really fun. I know there's Dr Fish on offer all over the world but I'm glad I came across this place as the setting was really nice.
Arty farty street,Place to visit for local hand made products. Simple street to walk through and not a huge market or maze to navigate. Good to visit if you have time but not a must.
Good market to visit in Seoul,A very busy and buzzing street of vendors with interesting stuff to buy. Most shops have the same product to sell however it is still worth a visit.
Its a nice place to hang around.,"It's a must to go if you stay there. Get your friends or family gather together and enjoy the nught with nice ambience and uniquely done restaurant. Good place for those who love to take pictures , lots of picture. "
Go there,"Very pitoresque old Seoul street. Nice little shops, yraditional costumes, some art galeries. Local people stralling up and down. I am shure you will enjoy it"
awesome vibe!,"Beautiful crafts, art galleries, local food and vibrant atmosphere. Great place to visit for souvenirs. Best hotoks!"
The place to shop and eat,This is the place one would shop and eat although nothing is special about the place. Lots of testaurants cheap and expensive. 
Much too touristic,"Insadong street is much too touristic, imho. Of course there are many art galleries, a lot of souvenier shops, some restaurants and shopping mall located here but it seems to be more a kind of attractions for tourists. I would say that much more atmosphere could be felt in Myeongdong district."
Many souvenir shops!,I walked along the main street in Insadong. It was a very long street with shops selling souvenirs on both sides. Most of the shops sell the same things though. But it was a nice walk down the street.
tradition street of Seoul,good place to go and experience some tradition stuffs and can also try wearing tradition Korean dress hangbok.
Nice Tourist Trap,"Insadong is nice. It's got the traditional trinkets, the wide array of Korean food, etc. It does cater mainly to tourists, though, so it is a sanitised version of Korean culture. Worth a visit, but don't expect much."
Korean shops,"I enjoyed walking these streets, looking inside these small shops and of course all the people watching."
Great But Small,"Only spent 3 days in a hotel right in the center of Insadong. Full of restaurants, bars, including a couple of Craft Beer/restaurants. Much is closed on Sunday mornings, but many open later in the day on Sunday. People are all very nice, some English spoken at most restaurants, but not all. 2 days exploring Insadong is more than enough time to find cool places to eat and drink, otherwise not much else there."
small shopping area,This is an area with narrow alley streets with shops & restaurants. Cute for a little shopping jaunt
Nice shopping area,"Insadong is not only a street but an entire area with many interesting places to visit. Primarily a shopping area with many many modern and traditional shops where you can find everything, from the last fashion to beautiful Korean ceramics. You can also see all the people around, particularly in a week-end when a lot of Koreans go to the area for shopping and have fun. A part or the shops there are many art galleries, all of the presenting outstanding artworks in very stylish buildings; and several restaurants where you can eat all kind of food at different prices. Not to miss if you visit Seoul."
A peep into the past,"The main street in Insadong is lined with quaint old-fashioned craft shops, food places, and shops selling all kinds of wares. It was interesting to wander through it."
NICE PLACE TO STROL,"Everytime when in Seoul, we will visit this place (Insadong), like it because is nice, with shops and café, we always visit Innis Free café. "
Fun shopping!,This street if filled with old traditional Korean items that's just perfect for souvenirs and gifts to bring back home. Many items are over priced and there's no bargaining but it's still very fun to walk through. I especially like the old book store where you'll find many candies and toys from back in the day--70's and 80's. The street food here is pretty tasty as well and cheap! 
Shopping street,"Another shopping street but different, with more handicraft shops then other streets. Not too long but interesting."
Must see,Perfect morning of shopping. From flea market tourist knick knacks to art galleries and up scale shopping- it's all here. Every little alley brings more to discover. It starts to get busy around noon. Something for everyone. 
Interesting cultural street,I spent a whole afternoon in Insadong in early May. Enjoying watching locals and foreigners dressing up in traditional costumes parading along the street. Lots of food stores selling famous local dishes - worth trying
"Good variety of shops, quirky fun, eateries galore","Great little area. Quite touristy but quirky enough to be enjoyable. Lots of eateries, tea houses, coffee shops to sit and enjoy once you need a break from the shops! Can pick up some good Korean souvenirs here. Not too hard to find quality items, but the cheap trinkets are also available if thats your thing."
My favorite Market,"Very busy, but beautiful. Lots of arts and crafts to take home as treasures. I got a beautiful hand stitched pillow case, some cosmetic bags, beautiful fans, candies."
"Shopping, bread n vegetarian restaurant",There's a halal Indian restaurant but d flight of stairs was rather steep hence d vegetarian restaurant was d next alternative. D food was very delicious.
Artsy cultural area of Seoul,"Consisting of a main street with several side alleys, this area has a good vibe. Lots of art galleries, shops selling lovely paintings, pottery, and other korean items. Plenty of restaurants and cafes too. Easy to reach by metro, get off at Anguk Station and its right there."
Lively Place!!,Insadong is nice place to roam around. Comparatively narrow roads but can do lot of shopping from high end shops to small shops. Tourists can find many Souvenir shops and small eateries. The whole area is walk able and well connected to public transport. Happy travelling!! 
Great Vibe,"Really fun street with lots of shopping and restaurants. Always seemed busy with families, kids and adults alike. We went to this area several times and always enjoyed the experience."
many people and expensive goods ,"Insadong is one of the most famous place in Seoul, but lots of person and very expensive goods makes people feel tired. Especially, many visitors buy some korean traditional goods that do not have appropriate quality. Be careful when you buy something. However, good places to feel the korean style are there. Just you search a lot of things in there and see the many art works.인사동이 서울에서 관광객이 많이 몰리는 유명한 장소이긴 하지만 그로인해 물가도 비싸지고 서비스의 질은 많이 저하 된 것이 사실입니다. 한국 전통 물건을 사실 때에는 반드시 가격을 비교해 보고 적합한 성능을 지녔는 지 확인해 보시기 바랍니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 아직도 한국의 정취를 느낄 수 있는 좋은 식당과 가게, 예술작품이 전시된 갤러리 들이 많이 있습니다. enjoy your trip. "
Must see,"Great shopping street! Wonderful boutique stores, lots of tea houses, and coffee shops! Many foreigners as well as locals! Fun people watching! Highly recommend this being added to the Seoul itinerary!!"
Great place for food and trinkets.,Enjoyed Insadong. Had some great food and picked up a funky pair of glasses from a local manufacturer of frames. I would go back to explore more as I only had 3 hours during my visit.
Interesting shopping,There is a cultural ambiance with different stationery sold in the area. The streets are very clean with various types of shops. 
Traditional Tea House,We came across a traditional tea house in insadong. The building itself is hanok-like and the desert and tea are delicious
A fun place to spend the day!,"A nice place to pick up a few little gifts, or find a decent restaurant for lunch.A gimmicky cafe at the top of Ssamziegil, called Ddong cafe which has coffees served in little toilets. Surprisingly it is actually a reasonable coffee."
Fun to see the old town,We went with some local friends and they showed us a totally different side of Seoul. This area is cheaper for shopping than the main drag but our friends cautioned us to look at labels since many of the cheaper goods were actually made in China. It's a great opportunity to see authentic decor and eat at some nice restaurants. 
Touristy street with some cool shops ,Decent way to kill some time but all the shops are mostly junky tourist items. It appears to have some nice cafes and restaurants. 
Overated,"We've been here a couple of times before to the main shopping strip and been unimpressed both times. Store staff are pushy and goods are way overpriced. It's crowded on any day. It's saving grace is it's close proximity to Bukchon village, Myeongdong and palaces. "
Another great area to see,It's a fun trendy area with loads to discover. just get in there and get lost. so vibrant with interesting street food vendors which offers different kinds of yummy stuff.
"Shopping, Eating and Eating","Greatly displayed stores mixed with bars, cafés and restaurants in the allies. It has a great vibe. Youth, couples and good old friends will find something to do here."
Great time,We walked around through a lot of shops and street vendors prior to attending the Buddha festival. The kids enjoyed it and so did we.
Senior Deputy ,Great boutique of shops and restaurants a good mixture to be with the local people. Found lanterns - I want to bring some home and have a party with my family and friends to share some of cultural experiences .
"Great for strolling, eating, shopping and more","Had a great visit and walked the area many times. Each time with a different purpose. Eating one time, coffee another, shopping a third, massage another, and just passing through another. It is great and safe. Decent prices and good food. "
Love this street,If you only have a short time in Seoul you should take you time to see this area. I just love it. The street is full of souvenir shops and shops that sell equipment for paining and calligraphy. You can get very good gift here. There is also a lot of street food here. I had my lunch here eating skewers from the street vendors. Very good!! You may also want to rent an Hamok here or what it is called the traditional Korean costume. You can rent it by the hour and it is not expensive. I saw a lot of people walking around like this and I told my friend that we have to to this next time I am in town. I walked to Insadong from Myeondong with no troubles by using the google map. These two spots are not so far from each other.
Shopping for knick knacks,This is a street that sells just about anything and everything.Interesting walk along this street with all kinds of  street food and also can watch the stalls making the dragon beard candy 
Another shopping market in Seoul,"Seoul has so many shopping market: Namdaemun, Myeongdong, and this one is Insadong. What is the different? Insadong offers various types of things such as clothes, watches, hats, etc, similar to other markets but it is not spacious like the others. The price of the selling products is more expensive compared to that at Namdaemun. But, the location is much better than Namdaemun."
Tourist have ruined this place and the merchants have catered to this junk!,This used to be a trendy and semi-quite area to find nice artistic items as well as antiques. Now there are huge crowds of tourist who act horribly and do not bring credit upon their home country. Merchants have caved in as well and are selling tourist junk to the masses. Very sad to see what this place has become. 
"If Your Shopping for Korean Gifts to take home, Insadong is the place to come! People Watching is great as well!","I have been to Korea many times, when I am looking to buy some Korean specific gifts to take home to friends and family I like to come to Insadong area. They have the main shopping area blocked off from car traffic, so there is a lot of people walking around fromall over the world. There is a lot of the stores selling the same thing, Korean gifts, such as purses, fans, Korean Dolls, in addition this area is big on Art and has several small art studios in the area. Of course you have a bunch of restaurants, I would say most has tourist pricing, so I personally think, better places to go eat and at better pricing. I think this is a great area for people watching, in particular they have several stores that rent the traditional Korean clothing for a few hours. You will see quite a few, mostly ladies wearing the traditional Korean dress called the Hanook. A place to go and spend a few hours shopping and people watching for sure. Recommend you go at least once."
My favorite place to stay in Seoul,"Each time I traveled to Seoul, I stayed at Insadong. It is very convenient in location but less busy and noisy than Myeong-dong. Hotels are quite cheap in this area. Easy walking to Changdeokgung and Changgyeonggung Palaces and Jongmyo shrine. Good eating places (including Ginseng Chicken Soup restaurant) are within walking distances. In addition one could easily walk to Cheonggyecheon (nice waterfall to visit at night)."
Good variety,"Not unlike similar markets around the world. Lots of food, trinkets and stores. Limited performance art."
An Enjoyable Place To Wander For A Few Hours,"Although quite touristy, Insadong is nevertheless an enjoyable and engaging area to explore. Local craft shops, restaurants and lots of street traffic on this walking street make Insadong a must see for any visitor to Seoul. "
Cultural and art streets ,I liked the area there is it artistic and cultural lots of souvenirs and traditions products shops. You can buy hanbok costumes from there. You can join your visit and be after visiting the Gyeongbokgung Palace it is around 15 minutes walk or one stop by the metro. 
"Arty, touristy",We found the Insadong area particularly well suited to tourists. There were plenty of souvenirs available that we didn't see in aaaaalllll the other market areas of Seoul. Art houses and coffee shops and restaurants everywhere (surprise!)
Craft every where !,"As the title, this place devoted for peoples who want to buy crafts or korean traditional candy.And they have a delicious 'jajangmyeon' here "
"An artistic street, a street which makes you feel like you are in Korea","I went to Insadong twice during my 8 days stay in Seoul.The shops along Insadong street carry only signs in Hangul, there is no English sign.Including Starbucks. This is the only or 1 of the very few starbucks in the world which does not carry English sign.I felt so 'Korean' when i was walking along Insadong street.Check out the stalls, some stalls could be selling the same stuff but it's so artistic and so authentic.Must go to Ssamziegil, which is known as the ""Special Insa-dong within Insa-dong."" It's a building which u will never miss when walking along Insadong street. I went to every single stall / shop in the building."
Full of Art,"I was not impressed with Insadong. At first, I taught this is a great place to stroll, but my expectations was wrong. Although there are a lot of goof cafe's and hidden restaurants, the place lacks interesting things that would appeal to a variety of interest. "
"Local Culture, Shops & Restaurants","A walk or a short subway ride from Gyeongbokgung Palace is this busy street filled with shops, restaurants, locals and tourists. Loved walking down the street and people watching. Found a small underground Korean Restaurant where we were obviously the only tourists. Soup with large beef dumplings and vegetables was wonderful! "
Peaceful Place,"Although this place is a shopping area, it's vibe is more chill and way too less crowded than Myeondong's."
Looking at good old days,"I grew up in Korea in 60's and early 70's.The street vendors reminds of my good old days eating very traditional sweet and laying games, but never wore Korean dresses. Nowadays so many young people rent out the Korean traditional dresses ($10+) and walked around the Insadong very impressive and beautiful. Long walk checking around old houses village and shipping area. "
Nice,"Nice neighbourhood with alot of shops and restaurants on small alleys. Very touristy, though. Constant car traffic on pedestrian areas is very annoying, though."
Old village with many handcrafts.,Went to Insadong after visiting the palace. There are many shops selling arts and handmade items. Do look around before buying as some shops sell cheaper. The hanbok rental is cheaper here and more designs to choose from.Do visit before evening as they close early. 
Lots of shops to explore,I was in this market a couple of times as it is fairly close to the Buddhist temple and to the palace. It was not busy when I was looking around and it was quite straight forward for navigating purposes. To be honest each shop as the same stuff but the farther you walk down the better prices you get in my opinion. 
The place to look for souvenirs,"Insadong is the perfect place to look for souvenirs to bring back home as well as for arts and crafty things. You can also find hanbok rental shops here, which costs four times cheaper than the hanbok rentals near the Gyeongbokgung palace. For Muslim travellers, there are a couple of halal Indian restaurants in this area."
Classic Spot,Insadong is the place to go to when you would like to experience Korean 'tea ceremony'. The place has all ingredients for everything Korean-ish. Alleyways will take you to the olden days feel. We found a small and hidden vegan restaurant and a tea place in the backstreet of Insadong. It is worth the money to visit this popular place. 
My favorite place in Seoul,We had a wonderful time walking through the narrow streets and alleys. Had a delicious lunch and enjoyed visiting traditional tea houses. Would definitely come back if I visit again.
Lovely traditional street ,This place is great for window shopping or buying souvenirs. Stop at ssamziegil for a scenic winding path of great handmade items. At the top there is a photo sticker booth and cafe. Definitely worth at least one visit here !
Get ready your wallet!,"Insadong is a place you cannot get tired of. With flea markets on weekends, this place offers you surprises as a great shopping destination for accessories and souvenirs (traditional or unconventional). The small alleys offers surprises on traditional architecture and great food. Even Taiwan's Cheesetella can be found at Insadong too. A great place for shopping and I am already planning my next trip back soon."
Traditional,"This is the best place to find souvenirs from Korea! This place is cute and happy, and fun to window shop in!"
Variety of Food ,We visited this place during lunch and most of the places were shut. It seems you can see a lot of action at night in this area due to variety of pubs and expats in the area. 
Great experience,"Authentic gem of Korean culture, history and gastronomy in one place. From Beauthiful Tea museum to Kimchi museum, art gallery, Beauthiful hanbok to purchase or to rent, souvenirs, bookstores ... Even Poop land with delicious cookies :) Everything you could experience is here in one place. "
Insadong,Insadong turned out to be one our favorite parts of Seoul. It is a pedestrian area with lots of shops and restaurants. More upscale than Namdaemun market. 
A jump into history,"This area is close to the north palace - Gyeongbokgong palace. The little streets and shops have an amazing historic feel once you step in. Surrounded by a mix of people wearing jeans and tshirts and the others wearing traditional Hanboks, you'll definitely feel the beauty of the culture. "
Great experience wandering through Insadong,"Visited the Buddhist temple before venturing into Insadong. Good to wander along the streets, unfortunately the tea house we wanted to visit was closed until May, but a great experience for visitors. "
Crafty&Arty,Everyone visiting Seoul should take sometime to stroll through Insadong. Many of the merchandise here are local made & you can pick up nice gifts or souvenirs in the many shops here. Enjoy the walk and if you can also rent a hanbok to wear. The atmosphere is nice specially in spring time when the air is cool and fresh.
In the fun at Insadong,A great place for souvenir hunting and good food to boot. We made the trip to Korea twice. Went to Insadong shopping the first time the first day. We realized that this time we wanted to go and shop the last day because it is great for the last minute items.
Lively neighbourhood with good food,Really comes alive at night with plenty of street food and little stalls offering the cuddly toy prizes. A good place to go to for food. 
Antique market,"An enjoyable place to visit especially if you are passionate about antiques..lots and lots of great treasures..Also has fine stores..one particular store that comes to mind is called Araya. Its a very high priced boutique, mostly hats, has some clothes, extremely well made, of high quality and very pleasing to the eye.."
"Disappointing, cheap tourist stuff","Although it's touted as a popular tourist attraction, don't go shopping thinking that you're going to find anything unique. Mostly cheap tourist items. Crowed, and you waste too much time just getting there. Look elsewhere. "
i love this street.....,i prefer this street / area compare to Myeongdong street.i still can found some herritage building in this area.
Food & Shopping,Great place to stroll around & explore. Always so vibrant and busy. Many shops and restaurants. Worth a visit!
Lots of shopping,"This area is loaded with lots of shops and crafts, antiques and souvenirs. Also lots of Hapsen costume shops so you can dress in the local traditional dress. Neat for photos"
Great place for kids to do some art while parents stroll through Insadong,"Insadong is a great place to stroll around and explore paintings, souvenir and eat some great food like the poo cake that you can sample right at the entrance. The basement offers another hidden away gem though. A big room with different craft workshops (making leather bracelets, knotting bracelets, nail art (creating a pictures with nails and string), and designing pots, plates and other pottery or designing Russian matrooshkas. You have to pay for it (around 15-25 Euros depending on what you want to do) but it's worth it, both of our kis kept wanting to go back (my daughter actually did 3 nail art pictures. The staff speaks English and will happily take the kids for a couple of hours. So you can enjoy Insadong and look at the cute artsy shops in the mall or enjoy tea or green tea icecream on main street."
Love Isadong! ,"We loved walking around Isadong. It can be a bit touristy, but it has great charm. Walk down the laneways to find charming restaurants or galleries. Great souvenir shopping! There is a large artist shopping mall. Where local artists sell their work. It's all great!! Not far is Jogyesa Buddhist Temple. Worth a visit. "
"Food, shopping","Alight at Anguk stn exit 6. Once exit, u will see shop selling socks, walk straight to the Tourist information centre. Turn left and the whole stretch is food, street performance, shopping! There are two shops selling bags at only 10,000 won! If u are visiting, this is a good place to buy souvenirs home like Korean candies, magnets, wallets, etc. "
Living area of Seoul,"Insadong is a very lively area of Seoul. There you will find plenty of people walking along shops, restaurants, ...."
Great place to wander,Great place to wander around. Vibrant and busy. Lots of shops and restaurants. Close to subway stations. Worth a visit. 
Fabulous shopping area!,Great place to pick up some Korean souvenirs and have lunch. Many of the restaurants are on the second floor allowing for a view of the bustling activity below.
Culturally Soothing,"Must do, rent a set of traditional Hanbok for free admissions to the palace, gardens/park, tea-sampling; quite an experience. Insadong to Bukchon is just a stone throw, well covered UNESCO sites with the 4hrs rental.Lots of tradition and influence of tis history. Prominently a very Buddhist environment with traditional architecture, pottery & ceramic, embroidery and houses that bore the streets. "
Fascinating shops and worth a wander,Great little shops and esp. for arts and crafts and nicknacks. Great to wander around and take in the vibe. Make time to pop into shops and try the food stalls.
Just another boring street,Touristy street . Good for people watching . Nothing much to explore here. Mainstream touristy souvenir and art shops . 
"Good qualiaty ""Made in Korea"" souvenirs","Within walking distance from our hotel.Went there to browse around and found the souvenirs to be of better quality. Lots of eating places and cafes along the side alley, however sinceI've already had lunch, had to ""skip"" all the food joints.Bought an attractive ""made in Korea"" wallet at a reasonable price and amvery pleased with my purchase.For good quality ""made in Korea"" souvenirs, albeit at slightly higher price thenelsewhere, I would recommend this place."
Charming street,This charming area in the middle of Seoul has kept some of its old world village ambience. If you visit on a weekend you will be sure to see young Koreans dressed in the traditional Hanbok clothes. Great place to pick up some crockery and souvenirs.
Nice place next to Myeongdong,We went here during our last day in Seoul. It has a lot of restaurants to choose from and a lot of souvenir shops also.
Good place for souvenirs ,Many souvenirs and arts stores along the whole Main Street. Famous for the Poo pancakes and toilet cafe. On one of the side street we found a good Korean restaurant with nice hot stone bibimbap.
Interesting Small Shops,"A nice place to get food or peruse small shops. Local items, art, street vendors and other places to spend time wandering and shopping."
Good walk around,"Great walk around the area, best linked with a visit to GyeongBuk Palace and the King Square as they are all within a good walking distance with great transport links to Dongadaemon after insadong (if your legs can cope!), if interested I hopped on bus 7205 - approx 6 stops and your Dongdaemun. Shoutout to the tourist information centre .Area is crafty and mainly for souvenir shopping. Possibly good photos along some of the alleyways .Not so great for shopping, as most shops sell the same thing, and noticed some of the items are over priced compared to other areas.But def worth a visit if you link up a cultural day around Seoul!"
Quaint but lively,"I didn't expect to like Insadong as much as I did. You can easily spend 2-3 hours here admiring pretty pottery and great handmade items. Ssamziegil was eclectic, diverse and impressed with amazing range of handmade items and quality. Good place for souvenir shopping too. "
Handicraft and good food,"A shopping street with lots of handicrafts just like what you will find everywhere across Asia. However, this place has a mix of young artists works, traditional art pieces, and also lots of tourist traps.I was here on a rainy day, so it wasn't so fun, but I can imagine this street as a nice place to stroll on a sunny day.Noted that there're a lot of nice restaurant in the small alleys along Insa-dong."
Fun and Fascinating,"Can seem touristy but when you wander into the smaller lanes you'll find plenty of restaurants that caters to the local crowd. Scattering of beautiful old architecture all around the small lanes. The street foods here are really amazing too, try the Hodok (Korean Sugar Filled Doughnut)"
Ancient Seoul within the big city,The narrow alleys and the old and low buildings give this quarter a completely different atmosphere than other parts of Seoul. It is easy to get lost in the numerous alleys enjoying the antique and art shops and strolling by small Korean restaurants.
Fun walk,This street is a nice street to walk on and I suggest doing it on Sunday when it's closed off. It is lined with shops that are filled with souvenirs that are craft based. It's a bit tough to tell the junk from the quality but with a careful eye you can see what's good and what's not. There is a great craft mall (not the super touristy one that has all this plastic wrapped stuff in it but the spiral outdoor one whose name is escaping me!) it is worth a browse and you can find lovely little gifts there. 
Great shopping area!,"Loved browsing the shops, very inexpensive with great variety. not too expensive even though it is aimed at tourists. "
Costly!! ,Don't let anyone fool you it's not cheap at all the arts and local Korean crafts are sold hear at a much higher value than the other Seoul areas. The exchange rate is poor as well.
Must visit,"Whether or not you are likely to make purchases, it is a place to visit in seoul. Here is to find some local craftings for souvenirsAt least just enjoy some coffee or waffles in the cafes widely available."
Fun to walk ,Day or night the place is lively. . Very good to walk lots of shops and eating places.. There are lots of Folk Cultural shops to buy from.. if u are looking for a souvenirs this place is for u.. 
Good for souvenirs and food. ,This place is great if you want to buy gift to take home best prices and the store owners are nice and some of tgem give you a gift after you buy from them. We also found an awesome restaurant were you can actually sit on the floor and eat plus it was $20 for the three of us and it was a lot of food. 
Fun walk,"A friend of mine used to live in this district years ago; and it does not take much convincing for me to keep going back almost everyday when I was in Seoul. It is simply fun walking around. My only wish/ only missing thing is that it would be nice to have a friend to have a dinner with. I saw so many places I want to try, but didn't feel like it would be fun going in solo. Perhaps, next time!"
Seoul’s iconic neighborhoods,Insadong is a must-go destination for anyone visiting Seoul for the very first time. It has an extensive array of shops and restaurants to enjoy. Went to a street art vendor and i got them to draw for me an exaggerated cartoonist version of SHINEE's Minho. My friend love it - LOLx
For the artsy side of you,Do not miss out on shopping great deals for some souvenirs when you visit Insadong. Shop here for some non typical souvenir items.
Hanbok Experience,"We were here for lunch at a well known traditional lunch box place - but the highlight of our evening was when we made the impromptu decision to try the ""hanbok experience""There are many stores in the area renting out Hanboks - most of them help to dress you, do some simple hairstyling and you can walk around the area for 2-4hrs at different charges. We'd recommend browsing a few stores because some of them have really pretty ones that would be a shame if you missed them! We finally settled on one that was on the 3rd floor (look out for an orange hanbok display at the ground level and walk up the stairs). This shop had a beautiful collection of traditional and special hanbok designs. The ladies there were friendly and really hospitable. We were dressed and got our hair styled by an elderly lady who was very gentle and friendly. We walked around the entire area (feel free to roam as far as you'd like for some picture perfect shots) and came back to return our hanbok and hair accessories after 2 hours. The shop is safe with lockers for you to leave your belongings, just remember to bring some money with you in case you want to shop along the way. There are loads of souvenir stores and F&B options around the area so have fun!"
"bustling, fun afternoon walk",fun area full of shops and cafes though it was overrun with people idly passing similar time on a Sunday afternoon. We had hoped to find wider range of antique stores and a bit disappointed that shopping seems to be for knick knacks. The children's art areas and handicrafts were fun to see. 
One of the best shopping places,"Beautiful historical place.Best antiques, artwork and souvenirs shopping place.Really amazing, one of my favorite shopping places.Visited in Summer of 2015"
Souvenir shops are cheaper,"Cheaper souvenir stuff, you can haggle hard to find money changermostly filled with clothing stuff , you may find scarf jackets and parkasetude house, face shop, tony moly and missha and skinfood were some of the skincare stores "
OK Experience,"While not quite the ancient Korean experience we were expecting, the Insadong area does have a few blocks of shops....some souvenir and a few antique. Quite a few of the souvenir shops had some nice ceramics and inlaid boxes and decorative plates. For genuine artistic things like some brasswork, carvings, etc. the cultural shop at Incheon airport is actually worlds better even though the number of artists are quite limited."
Lovely historical neighbourhood,"Thus neighbourhood has a nice feel. It is where the first post office was started. Has a nice park - Topgol park which has a high marble tower which was saved from an old temple. The Main Street is full of lovely tea houses, nice local design shops and souvenir shops. Good vibe with locals and tourists wearing Hanbok walking around. Nice spot to spend some time wandering around. "
Another place a must visited,"In this area, there a traditional market selling everything here, the food, clothes, souvenir, household appliance including women stuffs"
Authentic tea shop in Seoul,"Insadong is always in my top-list when travel to Seoul. I love the walking streets, handmade souvenir shops. Having a cup of herbal tea is must-try in Insadong. There are hundreds tea shop, providing thousand kinds of herbal tea."
My favorite place!,"During our stay in Seoul, this is the place I fell in love with. You can buy all the traditional Korean staffs here. The street food here are cheaper than Myeongdong. We paid 2000 for 1 meat ball stick here but it was 4000 at myeondong. Korean Tradition tea is a must try."
Must-see place during Seoul Sightseeing,"If you want find and feel the Korean culture and souvenirs, you must visit this place. Really they have tons of traditional souvenirs with a reasonable prices. While you're walking down the the street, easily you will find very traditional performances to look and participate with. Why not, the typical gourmets also!"
Handmade heaven!,"If you're a collector, this place may be suitable for you..there were really great handmade crafts for you to buy...i was there to just walk around and had a cup of tea and bingsu.."
Great place for souvenirs ,They have a lot of souvenir shops on the main streets. There's so much to see and do. You can rent traditional Korean clothing and walk the streets while shopping around. They have a lot of restaurants to choose from and they also have the famous Korean beauty product lines. It's a definite must see while in Korea.
Great shopping and restaurant alternatives!,"Remarkably well priced goods and restaurants for an essentially tourist strip. Plenty of art galleries and stylish clothing and jewellery. Plenty of restaurants and casual eateries, with emphasis on Korean food. We stayed at Oralia Suites, which was briallantly located to explore this suburb and nearby attractions."
One of my favorite streets,This craft street is always an adventure. It is where I have purchased most of my Korean souvenirs over the past two years. There are many shops with similar items but also a handful of unique ones worth the visit.
Place of Great food,I guess i found here the tastiest food and budget friendly in Seoul. The food is very authentic which I and my parents love most too.
Alright,"It's an ok place to walk around durring the day. Some shops, food shaks and some street food. You cand find some nice souvenirs there too..I guess it's a part of Seoul and if you stay not far from it you'll end up there.."
Shopping paradise,"This is a street showcase traditional Korean culture with antique art and book stores, traditional craft shops. It is a leading gallery street. Lost of tourist shopping here. Compare the price because several retailers are selling similar products. Many restaurants and food vendors on the street. You can totally spend hours here."
Very cool walking street,"Insadong is a really fun walking street/district filled with shops of pottery and various crafts. Its a good idea to walk the whole street before purchasing, as many shops have similar products. "
Street Market ,Good experience and the seller most of them very persuasive to try their sample. In Malay: dekat saja dengan palace Gyeongbuk jung palace 
"Good place to walk, people watch, eat and shop for souvenirs","I went to Insadong street twice while I was in Korea, once during the day and another one at night. I went in the morning for a quiet shopping trip to get souvenirs. There are places where you can buy chopsticks, vases, tea sets and small crafts made in Korea. People are willing to negotiate with you. There is a gallery with small shops were the artisan is there if you want to get something too. Prices are fair and you can find a lot of options for different budgets. In the top of the gallery is the famous ""poo"" restaurant - where the food is served in bowls that resemble toilets. If that is something you are interesting in trying that's the place to go.At night there are street vendors selling food and everything smells amazing, I did not try because my husband had dinner plans for us. I much prefer this than Myeongdong street - where you can buy clothes and skin care products.To arrive there, there a few subway stations close, but because I was at the Express Bus Terminal, just got the orange line (3) and get off Anguk station exit 6. You know that you are in the street when you see a big monument of a brush pen - I cannot remember if from the station you turn left or right but it is just a few meters away from the exit."
Cultural Area of Seoul with Cute Shops,"Tons of cute shops, great places to eat, and almost like a hidden gem of the touristy areas. It's not as packed or as busy as Myeongdeong but still offers a bunch of culture and great places to shop and buy souvenirs."
Not interested in Myeongdong? Insa-dong is great place to spend a couple of hours before or after lunch,"It's a street full of little shops, a lot of them have knick-knacks for tourists but you'll be able to skip over those and find little gems hidden between the touristy shops. There is a great little antique furniture shop closer to the Yulgok-ro end of Insadong-gil. A jewelry shop with beautifully designed and made pieces by Korean artisans, a jeju island-tea shop, a traditional Korean arts and crafts shop with gorgeous knots and fabric, a ceramic shop, a traditional Korean calligraphy shop, a couple of traditional Korean sweets shops, a traditional Korean clothing shop for modern ajummas and interestingly, a small shop dedicated only to cat-related merchandise.Make sure you are there for lunch, off of the side streets along Insadong-gil, you'll find some good mom and pop restaurants. "
"Nice area, with souvenir shops","Nice place, lots of smaller lanes with many nice restaurants, small eateries. We just walked a couple of smaller lanes and kept to the Main street Insadong which has many nice souvenir shops. Pleasant walk, though nothing much to buy. Took the metro to Angguk station from Myeongdong station. Short walk from metro station."
Touristy But Not So,"This is a good place to buy Korean souvenirs. I liked it because the shops were great for window shopping, as well as exploring, with the heavy sales pitch you get in some countries. And there were mostly locals, so even if there were some tourist traps here and there, it didn't feel so touristy because you're shopping alongside locals. We stopped for lunch at one of the smaller restaurants and it was filled with locals. The food was good and it was nice to stop and relax for a while before continuing the shopping trip. Service was nice in the restaurant and everywhere else in Insadong. Worth another trip on my own without my group..."
Place to shop for souvenirs,If you want to buy something from Korea for your friends back home this is the best place to go to. There are lots of souvenir items.
Clean Place,The local vendor very friendly. People here love Filipino. Best place to shop for souvenirs. Easy access on parking 
You can spend the entire day walking around or just sitting at quaint cafes like cat cafe,"My first cup of tea was in S. Korea was at a cafe here. There are bars, coffee shops, traditional item shops, everything you can spend a day shopping or window shopping in my case!"
Nice shopping district,Lots of interesting little shops. Also a place to people watch as a lot of couples dressed in traditional Korean clothing also stroll around.
Go into the small lanes ,"Nothing much to buy unless you like to get some traditional Korean bookmark . Is 5 minutes away from jogyesa temple , worth a visit if you are around the area Go into the small lanes and discovered lots of authentic small Korean restaurants . Tried this hangari sujebi , all locals , we were the only foreigners , good soup !!! "
Worth doing shopping,Nice market place can spend a few hours easily. Very Korean market and small shops . We bought a few small articles. Location is near the palace.
Cultural and whimsical,Invading is a fun and whimsical place to find out about cultural and historic things. It is a very colorful place with lots of shopping with locals selling all kinds of goods. Most people speak English and are extremely helpful. Not pushy. Good restaurants also.
Your senses will be bombarded,"Title of my review is meant to be positive yah. Walking around insadong, I see many nice things (e.g. clothes, food, souvenirs, etc), I smell a lot of good food. Even in the cold, it's nice to just walk around. Maybe you can get some nice souvenirs or clothing ;)"
traditional architecture ,"There're many local food and souvenir shops along the street with traditional architecture. I was only walking around here, nevertheless I really enjoyed!"
"A stroll, a look, a bite and maybe a buy","A mix of touristy and local products. Likely more expensive than other areas but were on a one day quick stopover schedule so limited our wanderings. Nice little walk, several side street restaurants. Close to other ""attractions"" so a good stop. There were stores with beautiful hanboks, and traditional papers. We also saw tea and traditional and newer crafts shops. Make sure to stop in at Ssamzie-gil to browse the stores and have what tastes like bungeoppang (sweet fish shaped red bean pancake) but with a shape twist. (See pic) On a cold day a single set with cocoa, one chocolate and one red bean hit the spot."
Traditional,"Nice shopping , memorable streets. Korean crafts & ceramics. Traditional paper, traditional clothes & tea. Lovely streets to walk and breathe in the surroundings. "
Quaint Old World Korea,Very quaint old world Korea streets and shops with great views of Seoul. A must see while in Seoul S. Korea
Not for the claustrophobic!,"Even on a cold February day the streets were crowded and the smells intense! Many many small eateries and one aisle shops. The shopkeepers are many and try to entice you, but they are polite in their efforts. Be careful...there are cars and motorcycles/scooters on these streets!"
not a market!,"We were told that this was the ""main market for souvenirs and traditional things"". We found a long street with many shops offering souvenirs or other art and crafts , not a real market and not cheap!"
Unique art design,"Here got something special and traditional souveniers near to the ssamziegil plaza, sometimes you got lucky got tv show for cultural events happen there, i went there and got to see the cultural performance there."
Disappointing,expected more as most of the stuff they sell is mostly junky clothes from China and things you probably won't buy
Great area for shopping meals,"Metro Line 3 - Anguk, exit 6 walk 20m down the road and into the pedestrian street Insadong. Lots of shops and restaurants line the main streets and also every alleyway off the street. A good few hours can be spent browsing the shops with a coffee stop or two and then a meal in one of the many local and international restaurants."
Full of unique local artcrafts,This place is very commercialized as this is the avenue to showcase Korea's unique local products. Prices as quite expensive as compared to other non-touristy areas with the same ambiance. Quite a good place to walk-around and appreciate what the place has to offer.
Less crowded than Myeongdong,"I enjoyed Insadong more than Myeongdong as the goodies were more diverse. Myeongdong is mostly cosmetics, clothes, and food. Insadong had arts, handcrafts, and lots of knick knacks. We walked its whole length, and went all the way to the Myeongdong Cathedral, and was able to compare both sites in one day. I wouldn't say prefer one over the other, its more like, visit both. Highly recommended!"
Visit samzegil,"If you want to find art or any unique souvenior, come and visit Insadong. This place also provide to rent hanbok for 2 hour only 10000won, "
Great for Sounivers,This is a great spot to pick up souviners for the family and to try some local street food. Insadong is really close to the Anguk subway station so the location couldn't be better. Plus it's also in the heart of Seoul. 
Good for half a day outing,It's a good place for souvenirs and traditional shopping. Also some traditional eating places and tea places are there. There is a shopping mall called 씨씨. It's good to visit there as well. 
Great place to shop for souvenirs,Loveee this place. Its a good place to shop for souvenirs. You need to bargain tho. Dont forget to bargain. 
Lovely Walking Street Area,A very good place to walk around for the night if you're new to Seoul. There are some interesting shops and some good traditional soju watering holes. 
A must place to visit when in South Korea,"A trip to South Korea is not completed if not visited. A wonderful place to eat, enjoy the local culture, shopping souvenirs and spent a full day. Easy access by public transportation. "
I love Insadong,Love Insadong because of its mix of old and new and there were a lot of interesting things to do: dressed up in Korean clothes and having Korean tea and desserts.
It's alright I guess ,"It didn't live up to the shopping hype, however perhaps I didn't spend enough time there and go into enough of the large malls around it?Had some good places to eat, and the poopoo museum was there. Lots of souvenirs to buy but if you're also going to namdaemen get your souvenirs there, save 1000-2000 won per item on average. "
Interesting street,"This is a touristy street known for selling arts and crafts, antiques and souvenirs.We got here around 7pm and many of the shops were closed already.Most of the small and interesting Korean restaurants are located in the side street."
Everything you need,"At here you can buy souvenir cheaper, variety beg only 10,000 won each, handcraft, your own stamping name in korea 15,000, local dessert. Please try the squid bbq, "
Love visiting here!,"This little suburb is full of traditional Korean souvenirs and shopping items. There are many traditional activities to see on the weekend, like rice cake making. With many restaurants and many snack stalls (particularly poo bread (sweet bun in a shape of poo), it is a fun place to visit!"
Street Market to get Korean sweets,Insadong is the place to go if you want to buy Korean sweets as souvenirs. It is a long stretch of shops. Look out for a shop that sells korean cotton sweet. It's not cotton candy but some sort of cotton sweet. It's white in colour. The price is about 7000 won per box. We bought 7 boxes and no regrets buying them! It's really good. You should buy the seaweed too. Very tasty. There is also a fancy shop that sells tea. The price is actually quite reasonable. They also sell chocolates. Overall a good place to buy korean sweets.
Come here at least once...,"Quaint neighbourhood with traditional looking houses mostly occupied by restaurants or gallery, dotted with shops that sells Korean paper, Korean literature and calligraphy stuff, also great place to pickup some Korean made ceramic / pottery, if you look close enough you can get some really good deals and unique gifts!You can also hire a hanbok (traditional dresses) to take pictures around the palaces nearby, enjoy and have fun."
Don't worry too much if you can't make it here,"It's a neat area if you have a day to spend walking around, but I've never bought anything from the area, except tea. We ate at a Buddhist restaurant near by, and I bought some tea from the O'Sulloc Tea shop in the area (we visited Jeju and I fell in love with O'Sulloc until I read the ingredients). It's a nice area, very touristy, but honestly I could have skipped it and don't plan to return."
Fun street and a must visit ,Always worth a walk. Cool boutiques and the Osulloc tea house a must visit. Cool eateries in the surrounding as well. 
Quite touristy. But the small alleyways are interesting. Food & shopping plus culture. ,"This place is very near Anguk station. Quite touristy. You can get lots of tourist trinkets and gifts here. But beware, many are made in China. I read about pottery, and ceramics in this cultural zone but was quite disappointed to see many were made in China too. Of course, there's still some Korean products, but just be careful to check. Some of the items are quite pricey, so check a couple of shops if you want to buy. I bought a wooden spoon from an old lady for ₩1000 but one of the street carts was selling it for ₩2500! There are many eateries and restaurants in the area. You will be spoilt for choice. Check out the alleyways as they have many interesting shops or eateries too. We went to some galleries which we chanced upon and had fun looking around. We also found a Korean dumpling shop which was crowded with locals. Turned out to be a popular North Korean style dumpling which had been in business for decades. Not bad. It's a place for both young and old as there are some newer shops and cafes that attract youngsters. Nice to spend an afternoon here. "
Shopping place,"According to travel websites, this is a must see. Lots of souvenir shops with good price, and authentic Korean restaurants. "
Cultural shopping district,"This strip is much more cultural, nice little shops selling gifts. Great location for couples. I've been there twice. First time was fun, second wasn't."
Great Cultural Experience,"This is another area my fiancé and I just randomly strolled through while looking for our hotel on a Saturday. A night market was going on and the street was so alive with all types of cultures. I saw a lot of foreigners walking around. Just a lovely walk through of yummy food, cheap buys and a fun clean atmosphere. "
Shopping,"If you are into shopping for small bric-a-brac this is the place. Tons of small shops selling whimsical items. Personally not my thing, I have enough stuff I don't need more! But still even if not shopping it is nice to have a quick walk down and have a look if you have a spare 1/2 hour (more if you want to look around inside the shops!) This area is where you will find the famous toilet cafe if you don't have time to sit down, there are many stalls around selling poop waffles, if your into that sorta thing, not here to judge! "
Beautiful historic area with traditional Korean goods for purchase,This is one of my favorite places to take visitors when they come to see us in Seoul. It is one of the more scenic areas of the city with its stone streets and many trees. Insadong is a place to go to appreciate traditional Korean cultural heritage. There are many delicious options for sampling Korean street food and the shops tend to be less westernized than other shopping areas.
Interesting,"Lots of local shops selling modern fashions and cosmetics, with plently of Korean restaurants interspersed. Best to go after 16:00 as then the outside foid vendors appear and it is amazing to go from one to another tasting the various fare. "
Interesting stroll through old section of Seoul,"Insadong is a great place to stroll around. The buildings have escaped ""progress"" and reflect the old Korean architecture, with many places lovingly restored - so many, your camera shutter finger will get sore. There are lots of snippets of daily life that you can see, despite the tourist traffic. Well worth the time to visit - you could spend a couple of days if you wished, but evn 30 minutes is worthwhile."
Decent shops,"Some good shopping here, but I still felt that it was all prices and marketed towards tourists. The people are nice so that was good."
Love Insadong!,"It's always a must to visit Insadong when I visit Seoul. However, it did change from the old days and now it's not as good as it used to be. When I was a kid, I didn't enjoy coming here because I thought it was boring. However, as I got older, I started to enjoy the traditional Korean décor and culture so I started to visit Insadong again. I enjoy checking out the stores and looking at traditional furniture and accessories. Some stuff are not cheap but if there's something you like, splurge on it! I bought a traditional wooden clock back in 2004 but still works and we always get compliments by guests. I am disappointed that Insadong opened cosmetic stores there because it looks out of place and a lot of the traditional shops are closing down. People should not come here to shop for cosmetics! :( I can't wait to go back so I can make a new stamp for myself. I often get a handmade name stamp when I visit because it's one a kind and you can personalize it. Insadong is a great place to see the more traditional side of Seoul so make sure you visit one of the many tea shops for some afternoon tea. :D"
Unique market streets,"Lovely place, it's nice experience to stroll through these streets and experience the ambience even if you do not want to shop. Some places are pricey, but you would occasionally stumble upon unbeatable deals. I got lucky with bags in one shop (any bag at ~ $10 and many of them were really good)."
Fun area to make your basecamp,"We stayed here for 5 nights in Seoul. I would highly recommend staying in this area for your hotel. Pros: safe, lots of boutique shops and eateries, easily accessible to the metro and some local landmarks. Cons: This area does not have late night entertainment or dining, Most places were closed by 9 or 10 pm. But there were a few places still open a bit later than this."
A must go in Seoul,It was one of our favourite places in Seoul as there are plenty of shops selling unique souvenirs with reasonable prices. There are lots of tea houses which serve special Korean tea and desserts which left us wanting for more. The tourist PR centre was just next to insadong and it offered Hanbook photo taking experience at only 3000korean won per person. Great hang out place with friends. 
Such a fun way to spend a day!,"As an American living in South Korea, I've been to Insadong with a group of girlfriends, as well as with my husband and kids. Both were fun trips, but I give the girls' trip the edge. Insadong is a wonderful neighborhood to explore, and lends itself to leisurely wandering. For lunch, we ducked into a basement restaurant full of Koreans, where chefs were making delicious, fresh mandu (potsticker type dumplings). We also happened upon a lovely, traditional tea house in an alley, where we enjoyed various teas and desserts. In the evening, street food vendors come out of the woodwork. There are countless stores to peruse at all price points, with merchandise including clothing, ceramics, jewelry, art, tourist trinkets, and more. You can spend a whole day here, or combine it with a trip to one of the two nearby palaces or the Bukchon neighborhood. Go, relax, and enjoy!"
BBQ!,"this is the place where you can look for a nice affordable BBQ, you can also have a walk around the street to sightseeing"
The SOUL of SEOUL,"Very good for shopping traditional Korean artefacts, apparels and food. Insadong should be your first destination for shopping before you visit the high streets "
A vibrant street!,Life starts only after 4pm! Some shops open as early as 9am. But the street carts starts from 3:30pm onwards! A great place to visit and shop! Lots of arts related crafts pieces!
A true beauty walk in Insadong!,"Insadong has markets and you can walk along the individual shops that you could find really nice souvenirs for your friends and family. We dropped by the most famous stamping and calligraphy shop that had been visited by Obama, Queen Elizabeth, and all others. I almost got one of it myself but was quite costly to me. So, we decided to go on our walk. Relaxing and many little handicraft to look at. There's an art center and you could find really nice crafted mother of pearl souvenir for friends and family. Mostly, key chains and local made either on the street or in the shop. Flowers really beautiful and handkerchief truly nicely made. Hand soup with decent scents and arts stuff. Don't forget to try the Dragon Beard Candy of Korea! This is totally different taste from others! The owner can speak a little of all languages and they will demonstrate how they do it. Well, if you have tasted Chinese / China Dragon Beard Candy, go for this one and you will taste the different! I love it!Get more time here to explore as we were just popping by before our next itin bring us to!Enjoy another market visit with trends, local feel, art sense and eating little food."
My favorite part of Seoul,"This is an long street of shops made by artists, many of them handmade. There are a lot of traditional Korean items. I have a special love for Insadong because my mom worked at a ceramics shop on this street back in the early 80s. We recently went back to that same shop and I say that only happened because it was Insadong. There is so much history here, not just in the type of items that are sold here but the shop owners and artists that are here as well. Spend a little more money on your souvenirs here and buy some quality traditional items rather than the junkie mass produced cheap stuff you'll find in Myeongdong."
Favorite part of Seoul,"For walking around, eating, shopping, this is a great neighborhood. We've purchased celadon ceramics, books, Korean crafts here. Close to Jogyesa temple, Changdeokgung Palace, Bukchon Village, Jongno Tower, it has a neighborhood feel. Great restaurants."
"Quaint area with tons of teahouses, souvenir shops, and eateries","One of my favorite places in Seoul with lots to buy, drink, and eat. There are tons of authentic Korean restaurants if you wander down the little alleyways. Highly recommend!"
Traditional Korean village experience,"Great choice for those people who wants to see how the old korean traditional living looks like. Good place to shop as well, there are many foods stalls and coffee shops along the way."
Trendy artsy area,"Some amazing hand-crafted art pieces here. Unfortunately there are tons of ""I Love Seoul"" type gadgets and other touristy things. There are several restaurants just off the main road, some in quite old buildings."
Insadong offers great walking tour both day and night time.,"Whether it's your first time in Seoul or repeated visit, you would enjoy local screen on walking tour around Insadong where you will find many interesting shops and casual eating places."
Cute little area,We stumbled upon this place by accident and spent half an hour just walking around the little shops. It is walking distance to myeongdong.
"Cool, lots of cosmetics stores",Cool place to poke around and shop. Clean with a fun atmosphere. Husband really enjoyed it. There is a convenient strip of cosmetics and skin care stores. A little more expensive than adjacent neighborhoods.
Souvenir Shopping and Korean Tea Shops,"Numerous souvenir shops ranging from trinkets to high end art can be found on this street: Korean style clothing, galleries of art, paper and art supplies, all make for a fun stroll. Many Korean tea shops serve delicious varieties and numerous places to eat Korean food as well as other types of food."
Unique little shops ,Fun walking along the street. Combo of touristy shops and nice modern Korean designed clothing and jewelry. 
Souvenirs!,Insadong is the prefect place to go shopping for souvenirs! The place is also filled with good street food and restaurants
'Souvenir shops Street',"Place to visit to get souvenir, mostly selling same items with some restaurants. Price almost the same as well. We were there during winter and shops closed mostly around 8pm by 9pm only cafe and restaurants are open. So if you want to shop, suggest that you shop first and eat later."
Nice place for tourism,"A really touristic place, basically for shopping since it has a lot of souvenir stores, of course prices are a little bit higher than other areas but if you wanna just try a little of everything at once is fine"
Unique and beautiful street!,"A place to shop for souvenirs, do compare the price and you might get a great deal. Some nice street food but it’s not cheap. Beautiful ginkgo tree along the road. Unique and pleasant visit."
Great area for cultural shopping,"It was a great place for shopping, especially if you are looking for some small souvenirs with traits of Korean culture. We didn't get to spend too much time there but it is a great spot for some leisure time.It had a lot of places with similar goods, so it it better to scroll around first then decide what and where to buy."
Cute little piece of tradtion,A little traditional oasis in Seoul. There's a lovely man at a table/stall just as you head out of the subway who paints fans and banners- his work is incredible and affordable. Grab some tea and take a tonne of photos. 
warm place,"the experience to walk in this district was amazing. you feel to be in a warm place, not only arrnaged for tourism."
Best place to have delicious local food and tea,"We are very familiar with all of Seoul, yet we always go to Insadong to eat at least a few times while we are there for a week. The back alleys of Insadong have wonderful ""hole in the Wall"" type of restaurants with authentic and delicious Korean foods! We are always taken to these restaurants by Seoul residents so I afraid I am unable to give directions or even names. Just get off the main street and explore the alleys and try any restaurant that have lots of people inside. Don't forget the second floor restaurants too. Tea rooms will most always be on the upper floors so look up and see where it looks crowded. "
Streets full of arts,"Enjoyed a good walk at Insadong if you have time in Seoul. You can enjoy shopping the Korean arts/handicrafts/souvenirs items or traditional pens (for calligraphy), paintings, ...etc. or visit the Ssamziegil building where you can find interesting shops inside, artists drawing."
Great District for Shopping and Eating,Insadong Street is a great street to find souvenirs of all price ranges. From the street there are many lanes and alley ways to explore and find small businesses selling a range of crafts but also good for discovering places to eat traditional Korean fare. Insadong Maru is a complex of 60 small Korean designer shops spread over several levels around a courtyard. Great for crafts and souvenirs with a café at the top of the building.
"Costumes, gifts, traditional tea and coffee","Isadong is definitely worth a visit. The main path is lined with souvenir shops but if you explore the side alleys you will find a bunch of traditional tea shops, which are a perfect way to relax while sipping some tea. Then, if you so fancy, head over to the mall with the spiraling walkway, at the top of which is Dong Cafe. Yep it is toilet themed! Another quick cup of rose latte maybe?Also of note are the costume shops you'll see here and there where you can rent a traditional hanbok and walk around in it for the day. Going to the nearby palace in one might be a fun picture opportunity."
Art and culture,"For those who are interested in the art and culture of Korea, Insadong shall be on your list. With the many teahouse, tradiotional and new, there'll always be a place where you can relax over a cup of tea. The many restaurants offer for reasonable prices a complete typical Korean meal. At some of them you may have to queu to have a seat during peak time. There are many artshops with paintings and supply shops for the typical Korean papercraft, calligraphy and painting. Streetartists give the right ambience to the place. The area is easily accessible through public transport (subway or bus)"
Good shops old style buildings,When we finished at the palace we walked down this street. Loads of food places in old style wooden buildings. Loads of shops selling souvenirs too.
Intro to Street market...,"If you have never been to street market, this is probably a good place to start. Street market in Asia is super crowded and Insadong is definitely much less crowded. It's a good place to take a stroll while enjoying a little shopping and street food. But there is also restaurants to eat a full meal.Its a great place to grab Korean souvenirs: Hanbok, eating utensils, pottery. There is a mix of modern shops as well and Korea's many cosmetic brands can also be found. Pro: Less crowded, makes it easier to shop in peace. Cons: Communication can be hard as not a lot of shop owners can speak English. Not all Korean cosmetic brand is available."
fun,"Insadong is a neat area to explore. There are lots of souvenir shops and some places selling true artistry. If you're hungry, there are many restaurants to try."
So cool,"Our hotel was right by Insadong. We had so much fun taking daily trips to the market for dessert and shopping. My daughter had a fun time in the market with my husband. She enjoyed eating the ""j-cones"" of ice cream that they sell and looking for a new hanbok and souvenirs for her friends."
Happening place,A lot of street food and souvenirs. Go in the evening to enjoy the street food. A lot of shops selling souvenirs as well. 
Shopping area for traditional Korean craft,"A nice outdoor market area to visit if one wishes to buy Korean traditional crafts as gifts for family and friends. Some interesting street food stalls and restaurants around the area, good for visitors to recharge before resuming their shopping. "
if you like to shop,small shops around the area. this place is where you can get souvenirs. there are also restaurants around the area.
old Korea,I haven't been there this trip or recently but it gives real old Korea feeling that I always appreciate.... I appreciate more since I'm not in the country maybe.Sam-Chun-dong near KyoungBok Palace also gives the upper social decent feelings there. I haven't been there recently.I wonder if any nouveau scenes are there but has strange old feelings there.
"A relaxed and comfort walk to look, eat and buy","Comparing with Myeong -dong, it has less jam of people traffics and noise, but with more shops for design, accessories, antique, and local feast of dinning. You could not find those skin care shops as flooded in Myeong -dong, and shop owners also seemed more relaxed, polite, even you just looked and went away. The street is not long, but just for pedestrians, safe and calm. If you visited pearl and jewellery city, just spend you 15 minutes walk from it, and surprised you with a relaxed atmosphere."
Very good area for local food and Korean Souvenirs,"Stayed in a hotel nearby, and enjoyed this area since there are many good local restaurants and plenty of souvenir shops. Good for family travel"
"Souvenir, Tea, Art","Go crazy over all the souvenirs to choose from. They offer souvenirs in bundles and you can even get discount and freebies if you buy in bulk. Try exploring the whole district and be amazed by all the handcrafted items you can shop. From paintings to clothes and small crafts, everything in Insadong was very artsy and preppy. Another thing I enjoyed here was the tea shops. You can find O'Sulloc and other tea shops that offer different kinds of tea and sets to bring home to your loved ones or to add in your collection. "
crowded,this place has a ton of shopping and eating stalls. fun to explore and people watch even though it is crowded it is fun
Souvenirs,"After going to Gyeongbokgung, you can go here and buy some souvenirs. I would say that buying Korean souvenirs here would be the cheapest and most complete place to be. You can also ask for a discount by saying (kakajuseyo) and the vendor will give you 1000 until 3000 won discount. Sometimes they will give you free stuff if you buy a lot."
Plenty to see and do,"Dont be fooled by the usual description of Insadong being the gatekeeper of traditional trades.. The Insadong of today has plenty more than that.. The numerous galleries that line its streets are worth popping by for orginal works. Nib into the many side alleys for lunch/dinner and you won't be disappointed for sure! We had lunch at a Vietnamese restaurant coz we got caught in a sudden downpour and we weren't disappointed at all! I can't remember hw or which alley tht is anymore.. But I'm sure you could try and google '+84 Tea Coffee Drinks restaurant' and you should be avle to find directions. If Vietnamese food ain't your cup of tea, look out for O'Sulloc Teahouse! The green tea rolls are to die for.."
Nice to walk,Nice pedestrian street. Full of artisanal craftworks and souvenirs.Try to find hidden tea houses on the small side streets.
Souvenir town,look no further than to this place to look for cheap and nice souvenirs to buy. There are lots of restaurants and shops with good food too
Souvenir centres,"There is one street here where there are a lot of souvenir shops. There are other shops as well like clothes, accessories, eateries and etc. There are many art galleries too. Visitors can have a taste of local culture here and buy souvenirs before going home. However, the souvenirs are pretty much the same in every shop. If you are pressed for time, just go to one or two shops is sufficient."
Good place to buy Souvenirs and enjoy food,I came here around 4pm and spent time to visit interesting shops that sell all sort of things. You may stop by restaurants which offer plenty of good food. Stayed till 8pm and able to buy lots of souvenirs with reasonable price. Great stop in Seoul. Highly recommend for visitors!
Enjoy the shopping spree,Lots of stores to choose from and restaurants to eat. Although it is quite hard to look for a comfort room/toilet. However you may enter some shopping establishments to use their restrooms.
"After 10 mins, the shops just repeats itself ","I was quite bored in Insadong. Not much to see, and the souvenirs most stalls are selling are more or less the same. There was a building which supposedly have more interesting items and locals crafts, but it failed to intrigue. I feel that if you don't have much time in Seoul, this is one street that you can skip. Perhaps I haven't read up sufficiently on the interesting thing in this street... "
More a place for picking up last minute souvenirs,"Insadong is an area where there are lots of places to pick up souvenirs. There are some restaurants and clothing stores here as well. We decided to come here out last night in Seoul to get some souvenirs before leaving. However, buyer beware, there are a lot of stores selling the same items for different prices. We discovered this about 10 stores apart, 2 were selling the exact same magnets, but at different prices. Also, there are tonnes of beauty masque stores in Insadong. Seems like almost every 5th store is. Same deals too. Gets boring after a while. We did discover a really good place to eat though. It was located in a traditional looking building along the left side of the street. Anyway, we spent a couple of hours here, this included dinner, in October 2016, and accomplished our goal and left for home."
wear their traditional wear at insadong!,"You can try out Korean tradtional costume or known as Hanbok. I tried it at Insadong Tourist Center. To go there, take subway to Anguk Station (Line 3) Exit No 6"
Another Fun Spot to Visit,Invading is not as trendy or cool as the Myeongdong shopping street but there are plenty of interesting little restaurants and food carts to sample as well as a wide variety of stores to visit. We stayed in Insadong and so had a number of opportunities to visit the area.
Okay short street,This street is okay...may be worth a miss to be honest. Some small artsy shops but nothing much else going for it. Quite short so not really worth going out of your way to get to.
Traditional arts and culture with good food too!,"Insadong is the arts district of Seoul. Home to art galleries, street demonstrations and tea shops. It's a fun place to walk around and soak up the culture. It's full of people in traditional dress showing how to make art or traditional Korean food. Also a great place to pick up some souvenirs. The restaurants are nice but a bit pricey."
Nice atmosphere,"I really love the place , a lot of people , many traditional Korean things , a lot of Korean wearing the Korean traditional clothes , the people is nice , the place is woow , many Korean things to buy , clothes , sweets , Korean stamps, if you pass by Seoul you need to visit this market and place ,one of the most popular and perfect place in Korea"
Vibrant city shopping and eating,"Great area of Seoul with lots to see and do, the streets are lively and bustling and the alleys filled with interesting eateries and shops"
A must visit in Seoul ,This place in my opinion is probably the most important street to visit in Seoul. It gives you the traditional side of the culture in Seoul.
Interesting unique souvenirs haven,You can find many interesting souvenirs here and many many local restaurants in every corners but dare not to try as they quite pricy and not sure Tried the dessert place called The Poop and it was great as its quirky Had dinner at the Korean dumpling noodle which very popular with the locals but not so good for our taste
Quaintness in the middle of Seoul!,"A preserved neighborhood within Seoul, this district offers quaint souvenir shops, arts and crafts stores, traditional food stalls and interesting coffee shops. At the end of the main roadway is a tiny Korean restaurant (in the basement of a nondescript facade) that offers authentic and affordable Bulgogi!"
Interesting!,Different! Many alleys and traditional buildings. I had a tour guide and without her I would have gotten very lost. The area is amazing and a true experience of Korea 
Nice neighborhood,"Strol along the fancy and hip shops and litle resraurants. Nice teahouses. It is an area with lots of young people.When you are done it is nice to walk to the river, they dug up the old hidden river and made it a vey pleasant walkway."
walkable neigborhood with many small unique shops,Insadong is very walkable and with many shops and restaurants.The shopping center Insadong Ssamzigi worth a visit.
Korean Art and Culture,"Insandong had been our favorite shopping spot in Seoul. You will never get tired of looking around, it has so many interesting things to offer especially if you are a fan of art. Many shops within Insadong offer unique souvenirs that are not commonly offered in other stores around Seoul. It was also very interesting to see museums and art exhibits. Korean restaurants, coffee shops and street foods are also available. We enjoyed out time in Insadong, and we kept going back since it was also close to where we stayed. "
Great street experience,"This street has lots of souvinear shops that have the same stuff, but also a lot of shops that have unique items. We picked up some standard souvinears as well as some different ones like a traditional korean stamp. There were a lot of art shops here as well, but didn't find anything to our liking that was proceed right for us. Outside of the shops, there was a traditional korean dance near the entrance to the street. We toured on a Saturday so not sure if that happens other days too. The kids enjoyed watching that and they even asked our youngest to go dance with them. She enjoyed that. The street food is also not to be missed. I had been hesitant to try it, but after trying the chicken ganjeoung, I was hooked. Looks spicy, but was not. We also tried the fish cake that the kids enjoyed. There was also a round pastry that tasted like funnel cake and was filled with a honey concoction that was excellent. Don't be afraid to try it while you are there. "
Artsy,"The place where you can buy souvenir and gift. Near anguk station and jungak station, from here you can walk to gyeongbokgung and bukchon hanok village too. "
20 min walk,Cultural and food street. Short walk up and down if not stopping for any sit down meal. Shoppings and bakery stores can be found
Great Browsing,"This is a great place to browse and take pictures of local food - great varieties of dried fish, the sweets made from rice (called cakes in Korea) are an excellent snack - sort of like a moist energy bar. There are several coffee shops and great small stuff to take home for presents. I bought very good quality bits for my grand-children at a very reasonable price. All sorts of brand name goods, sun glasses etc. of course be careful of knock-offs."
Must visit even if you dont like shopping,"Its is a vibrant street filled with traditional tea shops, souvenir and clothes/accessories. Had lunch in a vegan restaurant in one of the numerous alleyways."
"Great shops, great Honey filled pancakes!!","Lots of shops, full range of prices and was fortunate enough to try freshly made honey and nut filled pancakes, cheap as but warning do not bite in too quickly as the hot honey will burn your lips! So cheap, so sweet you will enjoy!!!"
Shopping haven,Awesome to just walk around and soak in the Seoul vibes. Plenty of shops and money exchange places. You'll struggle to choose from the extensive range of ceramic gifts and knick-knacks.
"Cool street, lovely crafts",Loved the crafts here. Charming tea rooms and cafes hidden in the alleys with traditional architecture. 
quirky back alley eating,"Be brave. just wander the back streets. People here are very open to tourists, I got a lot of help with monolingual ordering, they take visa over cash, and the food is great. "
Touristic trap,"This road is a touristic trap, nice to walk by, but nothing special to focus on. The prices are reaching heaven hights and services are pure. No option for non-Korean food, and you have to really search for a hygenic clean place to eat."
Nice stroll in living historic area,Wandered through to see how people use to live and shop. Cute stores and restaurants throughout. Recommend within walking distance from Palace
a taste of Korean culture,"This is one of my favorite places in Seoul. It is accessible from the train station and close to the other tourist spots. I prefer buying souvenirs here, a lot of options and bit cheaper. Also this is a good place for food tripping. "
Nice place in seoul,"this is probably the place I like the most in Seoul. Every corner of the street is just lovely in its own way. A lot of souvenirs shops on the street, with reasonable price. Ssamgiziel is also worth to drop by for 1hour. When you're tired of shopping , the street food is all around. Try the chicken bbq ^^. Some nice guys sell the candy (don't remember the name) -- it is the King's candy as they said. They will perform how to make a candy right in front of your eyes ^^, very interesting. so after watching their show, no one could leave without buying one box :)"
A street of art and antiques,This is me second favourite place to visit. I stayed very near to this place when i had my holiday in Seoul. It's a place where you wont go hungry or thirsty. There's restaurant and cafes around the place. It is also well known for art and antiques. This is a place where you should not miss.
My fave place,"This has always been my favorite place in seoul. Its nice to walk around during the afternoon to browse the shops and try out the coffee shops in this area. Take time to explore the small alleyways too, some interesting restaurants are found there. There are also events during the weekends and street performers."
OK,Shopping area. Souvenir items can be found in quite a number of outlets. Good for a stroll and to observe the activities
Good place to explore,I liked this place as you have lots of shops and cafes in this area. Did not buy much here as our guide told us you will get cheaper deals in Myeongdong. 
Traditional ,It's a nice place that you must visit if your I. Seoul. Nice art work handcraft all kind of traditional things and nice restaurants
Great place to wander and shop,"This area is a great place to wander and shop for trinkets, clothes and souvenirs and is full of street vendors and restaurants. You will also see people in traditional dress which they have hired to visit the Palace nearby adding colour and fun."
Great place to buy Korean arts,"You can find souvenirs across the spectrum of cost and quality here. If you stop no where else on your trip to bring things back home, stop here. "
the place to buy souvenir,"as recommended by my friend, this is the place you could get souvenirs for your friends/colleagues back home as they are selling in bulk of 10 or in singles e.g. korea related keychains, fridge magnets, chopsticks, etc. bought a few myself as wellif you look carefully, the names of the shops in Insadong are named in korean, e.g. for Starbucks, instead of having the name Starbucks shown on the shopfront, it was written in korean. and this are also seen in other English named shops, so this is pretty cool to me. (:"
Touristy but eclectic mix of shops,"Love Insadong - it wasn't cheap by any standards but we enjoyed the eclectic mix of shops, including the handmade jewellery, home accessories and street foods. We picked up some handicrafts, a couple of accessories and fresh snacks, then noshed on street food like the 'doodie' buns (shaped like poop, I kid you not) and the deep fried buns filled with honey caramel and nuts. Worth a visit at least once and made for interesting window shopping"
Fun to browse,We enjoyed browsing all the tiny shops and seeing some of the traditional Korean crafts - we purchased some beautiful patchwork bags and table runners to take home. Prices were quite reasonable.
Lovely Fall colors everywhere,It was like love at the first sight!! I'm loving Insadong because of it's uniqueness. Even wall with fall leaves look pretty. All stores here are written in Hangul and there were a lot of locals went here using Hanbok. Soooo lovely ❤
Good walk. Combine it with Bukchon nearby.,"We were in Seoul 18-24 November. Seems that this year, autumn came about two weeks late, so trees were still yellow and red, autumn colors, when we were there.We were at Insadong on a Saturday and the weekend street protests against President Park were still going on.We started our walk near the tourist information booth (pick up your map for Bukchon here). Near the information booth is Osulloc Tea House where we stopped for tea. Then we walked across to Ssamji-gil (a shopping mall in Insadong). Do walk the shops here at Ssamji-gil. Lots is small shops selling souvenirs and trinkets made by local artisists. As you walk, you will see lots of tea houses and side lanes. We saw a quaint looking Korean house in one the lanes and walked into the lane, and discovered a small tea house selling Korean dumplings. We bought a take-away (3 fried dumplings for W3000). Yummy good!As we walked, we encountered one of the street protests marching towards us. But it was a peaceful march (see my pictures). One of the protestors was carrying his baby, so he wasn't expecting violence, else he won't have brought his baby.Towards the end of the road, you will see more street foods. We saw huge chestnuts (see my pics) on a push cart. In Myeongdong, we had paid W5000 for a small bag of roasted chestnuts. I didn't notice the price, but if cheaper, then you should try it at Insadong, We had a stick of roasted top shell. Rather inexpensive. It was a good walk. We back tracked to walk to Bukchon."
"Best place in Seoul, hands down!","Insadong has grown to be my favorite place in Seoul. It's the experience you want to have during a visit to Korea. Meeting friendly Korean citizens, shopping in unique one of a kind type stores and local shops while learning something new about the Korean culture. It's well beyond K-pop, K-beauty and Cafes, this neighborhood in Seoul actually has Soul, it's a MUST!"
Nice places to go looking for traditional Korean souvenirs,"A pretty nice place to go looking for traditional Korean handicrafts and souvenirs. If you have time, stop by a traditional tea house for a truly unique experience!"
Great shopping and beautiful restaurants,"This is a great walking, shopping and eating area. The shops have a lot of beautiful, traditional items from local clothing, embroidery, wood work, ceramic, jewelry etc. The great part is that most of the shops carried high end and high quality items- not the usual tacky stuff found in most markets. One such quaint store was a store that makes stamps- Queen Elizabeth was one of the visitors to this store. I forget the name but it is on the main drag and the fun is in finding the place. That's what travel is all about!Added to the shopping is the eating. This area has a large array of traditional restaurants. Wander through the narrow side roads and peep into the windows to see which restaurant you will finally pick. Better still do what we did. We had purchased something in a shop and asked the shop lady to recommend a lunch place. She pointed us in the right direction and that was one of the best dumplings we had at the Gaesung Mandu - Koong. You can see the dumplings being made when you look through their large window. Right across from this restaurant is an alcove which houses art galleries and the most amazing traditional Korean tea house. The varieties of teas and the ambience of this tea room is mind boggling- a must see visit. All in all an amazing place. Start walking!"
Cheap prices for souvenirs and good subjects for travel photography,This is the best place to buy good quality souvenirs at cheaper prices.... you'll see a lot of people wearing traditional dress.... a must see place... 
Take a stroll down Insadong,There were tall rise buildings as well as small shops in this area. You could also get souvenirs and tea in this area. Colourful and interesting place to explore when yo are in Seoul.
What a surprise! Good for even a cup of coffee!,"This was one of the unexpected surprises. The whole area is so artsy!. Galleries, coffee shops., souvenir shops, and of any kind, but with a good sense of elegance. Calm and sober, despite the large number of visitors. Should I come again to Seoul, I will plan to spend a whole day just wandering around this area. So much art everywhere!"
local feel,a walk through this place really gave me a local culture experience. many stores to choose from which stimulates my shopping senses hehe..
Insadong,"The quaint and yet buzzing streets of Insadong is a lovely combination in the heart of Seoul. The place offers you local food options, souvenirs and the people and the shops are really lovely. I did not plan to spend much in this part of town - but could not resist the odd impulses from the local shops"
try something different,"Shopping here is knowing what to buy, but also it is trying something different- the food, the clothes, the antique art, book stores, tea houses, crafts and arts. it can be reached by subway or by bus. We were brought there by our tour bus as it was part of a day tour. It is only a few minutes stop and so if you want to really shop then it is best to do it outside a tour schedule. We were able to buy some garments and Korean craft that were right for us. then tried some cakes sold along the gallery - it was good. It is something to be enjoyed if one is open to trying something different, something Korean."
Geat area to find local made items,"This was my second time to this artist district. Although you can find the typical tourist-type souvenirs you can also find locally made jewelry, metal objects and artwork. I just explored the main street as I didn't have much time, but would have loved to explore the side streets where there were even more stores. At night this area really comes alive with street vendors (food and wares). I would definitely revisit this area when I return."
My favorite walk in Seoul,"This place is just beautiful, neat and has a thick traditional element. Spending time walking and windows shopping at this place is just so much enjoyable. All shops at this place are set like vintage traditional store with korean signee if the store's name. I saw young teenage minggle with friends girls and boys wearing traditional korean dress, especially on the weekend. This place is more alive in the evening with lights and more poeple visits. Here you can shop smalls souveniers to hand made fancy arts. I like this place so much"
Souvenirs galore,"Nice place to walk down & do a little shopping. One has to beware as the prices are a little steep but if you look carefully, bargains are to be had"
Nice street to hang out ,A nice street with lesser crowd to visit with some unique shops unlike their more famous streets. Have plenty of food options too. 
"Cute, artsy neighborhood with a low key feel","Insadong is great just to walk around in, even if you don't want to shop. The street itself is cobblestone and the surrounding area feels very local, but accessible to tourists."
Love the excitement on the streets!,Love the traditional shops. Love all the food vendors. We had such a nice time there sampling all the foods! A must go and see for first timers! Lots and lots of shops! I'll be visiting there again soon!
Great shopping.,Came across a temple and religious celebration and the flower displays were amazing. The side streets are very interesting too. Shopping was good and we were able to haggle with prices. 
Must visit in seoul,"When in seoul, must go to insading to feel the city and korea! Great shops and cool restaurants! Walking around the area will definately bring you back again!"
Reminds me of Kyoto,"Insadong is the cultural centre of Seoul and where the Changdeokgung is. We fell in love with the ceramic shops, art galleries, cafes and artisan shops. Highly recomended!"
A traditional town of its own.,"Insadong is an interesting place. You can find modern and traditional shops selling Korean souvenir and small knick knacks around the area. A lot of street foods, restaurants an cafes too. It is also a walking distance to Changdeokgung Palace and Bukchon Hanok Village. However some of the traditional Insadong shop houses were being replaced by new buildings. Some of the shop house was gone. It was not like the way it used to be when I was there in 2014."
Local gem,"Our tour guide took us here for souvenirs and street food. Great Korean vibe, souvenir shops, skin care shops, Korean street food. I realized shopping in Korea is a bit pricey really. but great experience"
"Shopping Street yes, but I it is the side alleys that are charming!","Not your typical Korean shopping street - mainly because of its multiple side alleys. The best things about these alleys are the hidden restaurants. And they serve superb food. Mostly locals at the restaurants, and some are so small that they seat about 4-6 tables and they are full.Shopping is great too - mostly artsy stuff and souvenirs."
Loved it ,"Very beautiful street to shop for Korean traditional things quite crowded but we really enjoyed it Highly recommended but remember never settle for the first price you get , I got over 20k discount "
Shopping street,"This street is a car prohibited area, so you can shop by walking freely. Many souvenir shops here and artsy things, street food is available here also. Walk through the many alleys and you can find authentic korean food in many restaurants available there. Make sure you come in the Ssamzigil department store where you can find many unique shops selling interesting products made in Korea. Recommended to visit while in Seoul."
local handicrafts,if you do have time besides shoppijg do explore the restaurants here located at the back lanes. this place is great to look for upscale local handicrafts as well.
Pretty good shopping district ,"A bit more modern than Namdaemun shopping center but has a large variety of shops, and more importantly for me, a large selection of eateries and take away shops.Worth a visit if you love shopping, but i place this under Namdaemun and Dongdaemun because those places have more of the traditional market vibe i like"
My favorite in Seoul,"It is the attraction, which I would go back to any time of the day. Vibrant, interesting, beautiful and calming at the same time. It's a not to miss while in Seoul. "
nice stroll in the evening,equivalent shopping street but here offer more variety and can find some surprise in the alley. Able to find some local stall here. We had the cheapest korean food here through out the trip in one of the local stall in the alley.
So-so experience.,"Shops closes as early @7pm(Seoul time). Additional given as a courtesy. That's small gesture & greatly appreciated. Bought some handmade nuts snacks & they are really nice. Being the boss herself, she really does it from start to tending business, cleaning up. A friendly lady who speaks basic English & Mandarin. Her enthusiasm is attractive. A very positive energy that makes her very approachable. A nice place for getting from souvenirs to beauty to your appetite. Walking distance from Myeongdong. "
The Place To BreaK After Palace Quarter Sightseeing,"This is the place where you can lunch for traditional Korean food. After your energy charge, you can visit Insa-dong street to sample traditional Korean culture. Lots of arts and craft shops, tea-houses, antique art and book shops and art galleries. For buying cheap souvenirs as gifts, don't waste too much time hoping from one store to another. The items are mass-produced and prices are the same Of course, you can find expensive and high quality gifts to bring home. After shopping, there are still interesting sights to visit - the gorgeous Jogyesa Temple and Unhyeong Palace (if you are still not tired of Palace visits). You can stroll down to Tapgol park which is just a ten minutes leisure stroll. The Anguk Metro Station is just not too far away. Along the way, you pass by the traditional gold-smith and jewellery district."
"Excellent, cozy area to do shopping and eating","The entire area surrounding Insadong Gil is an excellent place to wander around discovering little trinket shops, cool restaurants, souvenir places and colorful back alleys. Definitely worth a visit."
Mixture of The old and the preaent,"Interesting place with this lovely combination of old times dwellings with modern life stuff. A very international street, so when I was looking for some places the foreigners would pont me that place out ))) Lots of restaurants and places to relax. I found here quite cheap lodging, and it was good even by the local standards."
Are you interested in art and Korean culture?,"If you're an artsy person, who's also interested in Korean culture, this is the place for you!You will find many different shops, and yes, some of them are kitschy, but most of them are not.If you're travelling on a budget, you will still be able to find beautiful gifts, as the price range of the shops vary.Hanboks are very expensive, but you can also rent one.There are some tea houses, where you can try traditional Korean tea.There are exhibition places where you can enjoy Korean fine arts for free.It tends to be crowded, but don't let it discourage you. If you're tired, take a break and continue your exploration, there are many amazing things you can get and experience here."
Lively Shopping and Eating with tourists and locals,"There is always something going on in Insadong. Maybe a school band or parade. Last Sunday there were many students dressed in native Korean attire, both girls and boys which added to the color of the market as they strolled thru the area.I always come here to buy local crafts and souvenirs. This is the place to find locally made items. One of my favorites is the black lacquer boxes with beautiful mother of pearl decorations on the top and sometimes inside the boxes. I purchased two this trip at the shop which is the most far from the main entrance on the left side. They will bargain with you on a lower price than the marked one.Another item that is a unique gift is a customized stamp with your name in Korean and in your language. It takes about 5 minutes to cut the stamp. It's a great gift item. Kids are fascinated by seeing their name in Korean. These range from $10 U.S. for a small one to hundreds of dollars for very decorative stamps. There are several shops selling them.I love to watch candy made on the premises. These are usually carts next to the street. The makers of the candy entertain the crowd as the candy is made. Great picture opportunities. One of those candy's is called King's Dessert and is made up of 16,000 strings of honey wrapped multiple times with a flavoring of either almond, peanut or chocolate on the inside. You can watch the young men wrap the 16,000 strings.I've been interviewed by high school and college students twice for class projects. Usually they want to know why I came to South Korea and how I liked it. The kids practice their English while doing this, There are many restaurants selling all kinds of food from fast food to fancy food. You can find Korean BBQ where you cook your own meat at a grill on your table. Also many places for tea and I think there is a tea museum.There are several art galleries too. Saturday and Sunday are the best time (and the busiest) time to visit since the street is blocked off from cars."
"Exciting, Vibrant Area in Seoul",Very happening international area in Seoul. Had fun walking the back alleys amidst restaurants and bars. Good for lower cost lodging and hostels.
Touristy Area,Insadong is a pedestrianized shopping area consisting of a main street and several alleyways.It is a touristy area and there are a number of art and antique type shops as well as the usual souvenir shops.There are a number of restaurants and coffee shops. It is worth a stroll but it is not really ideal for serious shopping.
Live and artistic buzz,"Everytime I visit Seoul, insadong is the place to buy teaditional cups, and koreansmall souvebir items. Novadays there are more and cheaper places, but I just like the surroundings. And an amazing Temple vegan food restaurant Insarang there"
"인사동, feels the local heartbeat","Near to famous Palace and Temples we drop by this acclaimed must-visit area of Insadong.. It is not a small area but more attention and activates is centered around one main road with alleys on both sides. Within the charming alleys are boutique galleries and traditional teahouses, and cafes. Famous for traditional Korean fine art from paintings to sculptures there are also Korean hanbok (traditional clothing), hanji (traditional paper), traditional teas, pottery, and folk crafts.One cannot miss the new 4-storey shopping centre called the Ssamziegil (쌈지길), (double yellow upside down ""yy""). . This unique ‘enclave’ shaped by connecting in the form of a spiral-like stairway. There are small unit shops that sell various items, ranging from fashion and art to food and accessories. There are 2 fantastic restaurants in the annex building too! Ssamziegil may be modern, but it is well blended into the surrounding more traditional neighborhood.Further down to main road of Jong-ro (Jongga Sta.) is the Market famous for Antiques of past Korean Dynasties. There are many pop-up vendors here selling foods and trinkets. You can eat Korean traditional snacks like taffy and pancake as you shop. We find Insadon a bit different from the other many interesting Seoul streets, especially the atmosphere and ambience. Very good for souvenirs, snacks, and just walking about, this place a must visit for tasting local delicacies. Crowded and be prepared to spend at least 3 hours browsing the stores, restaurants and little streets. An enjoyable experience for us!"
Shoping ,"Insadong is a market where you can buy lot of things mainly lokal art and handcraft's. It's a morse spectacular market than myengdong with plenty more thing's to buy and a different type of local food, try The dragonbeard it's a kind of bread that they are making to look like a beard and they wrap different types of nuts in, it's a nice things to try. "
Pretty alley,"There are a lot of pretty alleys that you can pop in for photo taking. But apart from that, there is nothing much to look forward to in insadong unless you like handicrafts. "
Touristy shopping street but enjoyable ,Had a short break from business meetings and had the chance to walk through. Good venue for Korean souvenirs most of which seem mass produced. A few exceptions stand out. Also interesting street food. 
Best place for shopping traditional Korean things in Seoul!,"Avoid going there during weekends, too many people. Best time to go there is before afternoon during a week. There are lovely shops with the porcelain and Korean drawings and paintings. In the small streets there are lovely tea places and some very good restaurants. Home made dumplings: Gaeseong Traditional Dumplings House - traditional Korean excellent food! And cheap! Often there is a queue but fast sorted. "
Galleries..and just traditional shopping street,It is just as like other shopping streets..have local foods..traditional sourvenir shops..galleries..you can walk along the street if you want to.. for me.. no cheap sourvenir there.. ~gudluck guys
Just another regular shoping street,This area is a little bit crowded with some cloths shops and other stuff that you can find everywhere. It is not a must see area unless you have some spare time to spend.
Ssamzigil Insadong ,"While walking along this street, u will find shops selling more accessories and local designer clothings. It's quite different from other shopping streets. U will find Ssamzigil Insading which is a small building with many small shops selling interesting goods. Worth to visit for different feel. "
Just wish that someone maintains the public restroom..,"Good place for serious art lovers but touristy price. Good for a walk and eat. I just recommend to eat on restaurant when you wish to use restroom/toilet. At the time I used the restroom, toilet tissues were piled up on trash can and has wet floor....uuugghh.. Looks like no one regularly maintains them...but they call this tourist place?"
check out the art shops,arty area full of small galleries and art shops ( the best) lots of independent shops and food experiences to enjoy
"Pottery, Arts & Crafts - Pretty Area & Good Food","We were there to grab lunch and end up walking around the area. There is a main road and lots of side roads. In order to fully appreciate this area, you have to venture out to the side roads where there are lots of shops and restaurants. I love pottery and they have amazing tea pots & cups. There are also shops that sell other items such as hand made scarfs and misc items. I personally thought the prices were high and end up just looking and not buying anything. Few shops negotiate so don't be shy and ask. Less crowded than other areas, I would highly recommend for eye-shopping."
Great,"Some items are a bit pricey, great variety of food. Great for late night strolls with friends, and it's also a great place if you want to buy some souvenirs."
My top 5 spots in Seoul!,"One of my top 5 places to visit in Seoul. Not only is there a main street of antiques and a souvenir shops, be sure to visit the branching alleys for restaurants, cafes, tea houses. Osullec is the famous teahouse, but do try the smaller ones, especially those located upstairs. Unfortunately these only have Korean characters so I could not read it or have non descriptive names like Tea cafe (?) So just be adventurous, my companion and I were never dissapointed. We went back to Insadong several times to try different ones. There are 2 buildings filled which many, many small shops where you can window shop from floor to floor without climbing stairs. It sort of spirals it's way up with an inclined ramp. Really neat place. "
Lovely shopping place,"Of all shopping place in seoul, i love insadong the most. It is convenient and beautiful. Found some antics there which is a great find. The shops sell unique items that i couldn't find anywhere else. "
Place to Buy Souvenir Items,"Our tour ended at a Insadong. A place where you can buy cheap souvenir items, ceramic cups. The souvenir shops carry an assortment of standard Korean utensils, calligraphy materials, figurines, as well as tourist goods. On the main street and in alleys are kiosks selling goods like the traditional Korean clothing and handmade paper. I also bought 4 pcs Aloe Shower packed at Etude shop. They have a sale as well as other cosmetic shops."
So-so,"Nothing much to do there. If you have some time to spare then visit. If not, just go somewhere else. Antique? Not that many. Art? Not that impressive."
Good Place for Shopping,Great place to get arts and crafts of Korea. So many different types of goods are available. We probably would have gotten lots more if not for self limits!
Touristy but VERY interesting!,"Insadong is one of the coolest if THE ooolest tourist traps I have ever seen.... The prices are reasonable (for a tourist trap) and the selection of souvenirs, etc is simply mind boggling...., "
Buy souvenirs here,"It's a short street, really, and all you can here is buy souvenirs. It's still worth going if it's your first time in Korea, though."
Great place to stroll and shop,"The natives aren't too interested in this spot, but as a tourist, I love it. I love the quaint old buildings, narrow old streets, and fun shops with a variety of goods, from cheap souvenirs to nicer art and handicrafts. A great place for souvenirs, some good eats, and teahouses. We were traveling with family native to Seoul who didn't want to spend that much time there. I would have wanted to spend more time browsing the antique shops and old book shops."
For the artsy and hip traveler,"Love the place! So many interesting stuff to see. This is where I rented a Hanbok for 15,000 won for 4 hours. I also had my illustration (drawing) done here for 15,000 won too. There are so many cute and cheap finds here. Their 10,000 won backpacks and bags are the ""IN"" thing now in South Korea. "
Interesting neighborhood with small streets. Window shopping and galleries are free!,"It was pleasant to spend a couple of hours (not including lunch) walking through Insadong. You will not be alone -- Korean tourists and foreign tourists will also be here, but we did not find that distracting. The prices are relatively high here but you are not required to buy anything. There are some very good art galleries with friendly proprietors."
Downtown Nightlife,"Visited the Insadong nightlife district given its close proximity to downtown (City Hall) where I was staying. The bars were strangely quiet and had a very limited selection of drinks (other than beer and soju). Compared to Itaewon on a subsequent night, Itaewon wins hands-down."
"Best Place for Nice Souvenirs and Art/Crafts, Great Tea Gardens too","I always enjoy going to Insa-Dong for getting gifts for family and friends. We have a few paintings and carvings from this area, and I got two more this time. Many nice places to eat, and some hidden tea gardens that are super relaxing. Definitely hit up Insa-Dong if you want to get some nice gifts, a good bite to eat, and chill out at a tea garden."
Shopping for Korean souvenirs and international ethnic food,The best place in Korea to shop at really cheap prices for local souvenirs and local and international ethnic food.
The place for tourists / art lovers,"Several art galleries alongside shops for tourists, cafes and restaursnts make this place ideal for tourists. Tip: don't miss the jogyesa Buddhist temple nearby"
Great for street photography and souvenirs,"Insadong is a place that at first may look a little similar to other places like Hongdae, Myeongdong or Itaewon, but walk a little further and you will realise that it has more to it than what you see in the eye at first.It is the area where there are quite a significant number of stores selling traditional Korean arts and crafts for souvenirs, such as fans and antiques. Sometimes, you might even find some unusual stuff that is unique to Korea there. It is a blend of both the old and new mixing well together in Insadong.There are also a few street stalls near the main alleys, which are slightly cheaper than those in Myeongdong. However, Insadong is the place for the more traditional kind of Korean cuisine, and many restaurants in the area often serve up this kind of cuisine. So it is a good place to try this if you are looking for something more authentic.What is a little more unexpected for me is that it is actually a great place for street photography, especially during weekends and holidays. As we happened to go down on a public holiday, many people came out to Insadong in Hanbok of different kinds. With the constantly moving crowds, there is definitely no shortage of subjects to shoot for street photography. Even the less crowded side alleys at great for photography too.There is a shopping mall of some sort called Ssamzigil in the middle of Insadong. For its design, it would be rather weird to call it a shopping mall but there doesn't seem to have any equivalent term to describe it. Many of the stores there deal with handicrafts and food mostly, but the top floors give a rather good top down view of the whole Insadong area.It is quite easy to get to Insadong by the Seoul Metro, as it is reachable through Jonggak Station, Jongno 3-ga Station and Anguk Station. Overall, it would take at least 2 hours or so just to walk around the whole of Insadong, and it is not too far from Myeongdong either too."
Interesting place to get lost in.,"Lots of shops and eating places, Lots to look at. It appeared to be clean and safe to wander around in but easy to get lost as I did. Not to difficult to find yourself again though. Good place to spend a few hours wandering aimlessly just taking in the sights and sounds."
Traditional clothes,"I like this place as this is full of life. People are going to places with traditional clothes and very charming. The areas feel very alive and many tourists enjoying all kind of shopping and other activities. Good place looking for art pieces, food and hang out. There are many attractive places to go and see and definitely good for shoping shopping and shopping. Recommended"
a place for tourist,you can get some shirts and food and its not bad for a tourist area. it's not cheap but nice to walk around at in the evening.
Quant and costly!,"Traditional tourist area, great shopping and sights, local crafts and fashions, paintings, textiles - anything you could want. Wonderful place to spend several hours (and dollars) and a must when visiting Seoul."
"Nice touristy spot to buy souvenirs, but quite pricy area","It is a nice spot to go to if you feel good wandering with the tourist herd. There are a lot of shops selling souvenirs, but these are much more expensive than in the markets for locals (where you can get basically the same stuff). There are some design and art shops offering quite nice and special things, but the prices were ""special"" as well- I only went window shopping. Insadong is recommended for people looking for antique pieces- yes, there are a few shops selling SOME antique stuff. Most things are fakes (and some of the fakes are incredibly good fakes!). The best indicator for ""real"" antique pieces is a really ridiculous price tag (however, some fakes had the same prices…). For antiques (or something looking like that), I recommend the shops near the Seoul Folk Flea Market, there you find the same fakes and some real antiques for less than the half price."
Traditional Korean,"Seoul has many shopping places but this is really different. There are many Korean souvenirs,craft and arts sold here. One can just browse around for hours. A must visit!"
The artistic street shopping experience,If you want to buy souvenirs or traditional Korean items you should visit Insadong! It has many nice artsy cafes and restaurants. There is a building there dedicated to handmade products made in Korea. 
Cute street to visit,This district has a bit of a different set of shops as they are more unique and crafty then the other shopping areas. They also have a bit more quaint dining options for local Korean food. It is walking distance to the palace which is also nice.
Korean,This street is another shopping street in Seoul but you feel that you are in Korea. They have more interesting items including some traditional Korean ceramics or silver works. Cute street.
Shopping street,"Shopping district not too different to Myeongdong but but more traditional in terms of shopping for local crafts etc. Lots of coffee shops to stop in at, fun stalls on the pedestrian walking street and the usual Korean cosmetic shops. On weekends a lot of girls like to dress up in traditional hambok outfits to walk around which is nice to see. Near other tourist sights so worth a stroll but not a must-do."
Awesome shopping place,"I give 4 thumbs up for insadong. I love shopping here. Good place, good products. For tips, you can buy ""I love korea"" shirt for cheap n best quality (and full emboss) than other shopping place. Around $5~$7"
Looking for arts?,Visited here for another walk-shopping-people-watching. An art lover? This place is perfect. The street are full with people and the shops offer many crafts and souvenirs (pricey compared to Namdaemun Market). This area also has few art galleries but unfortunately during my visit few galleries were closed to prepared for next exhibitions. There's also hanbok rental in this area if you wanna experience the feel of wearing hanbok and walk on the busy street.
Quite expensive souvenir,"You will feel so much youth vibes here! So many restaurants, cafe, shops and cosmetic shops, also fashion shops that will make you happy! But for some reason i think the souvenir shops here sell souvenirs with very high place compare to other market. I prefer buy souvenirs in other place like Dongdaemun or Myeongdong"
Great Place to Buy Souvenirs,"Insa-dong is slightly different from other shopping streets (Ehwa/Myeongdong/Dongdaemun/Hongdae) as it sells more of handicrafts, art pieces etc. It's a lovely place to shop 1-2hours around at. It is also accessible by metro (alight at Anguk station, Exit 6)"
Great place even at night time!,You should try to walk their both morning and night time (late one). Many street artist sing and dance at night. It will be a different experience.
Pure South Korean Shopping,We explored this area on our last day and loved it. Great shopping for local items in a less chaotic way than the larger markets. 
My trip report,"I really enjoyed my visit to Insadong.Thre main street is lined with shops selling traditional goods and many restaurants.My advice is, don't just walk down the main street,go into the little alley a fins unique shops and galleries.Street food here is priced cheaper than Meyongdong.Check out the shops selling traditional bronze and brass items, you will find some very interesting things to bring back home.At night, the streets becomes alive with a lots food vendors and bars."
Great stop,We love the cat cafe here. The cats were very friendly and didn't mind a two year old. We also ate lunch here at a restaurant that was located down a set of stairs and it was a hidden gem! Don't be afraid to explore this area! People seem very friendly and helpful! 
Great tourist neighbourhood,This is a great neighborhood to explore. lots of restaurants along the side lanes serving good food. The restaurants are in traditional korean houses and this makes for very good ambiance. The main street is great for shopping for trinkets. 
Lovely place to walk and have tea,"Insadong is a place for tourists, but a lovely place to walk around and browse the shops. My favourite thing to do in Insadong is to visit traditional Korean tea houses, try the plum, citron or ginger tea."
Look a Little Deeper,"I really enjoyed shopping in Insadong. I've heard complaints about there being nothing but cheap, mass produced, souvenirs. There are a lot of those shops, but if you look closer, and pay a little more attention you can still find older, artisan shops and antique stores. We found some really wonderful gifts and souvenirs that are specific to Korea. "
Great place to hang out,Lots of shops selling vintage or odd things. Some were selling traditional clothes and souvenirs. It was nice to see a mix of old and new things. Lots of restaurants too.
Interesting & Fun!,"Going to coffee or teas shop and enjoy your drink.Read a book,surf online or simple go people watching!Insadong is really the place to be with lots of souvenir shops and great finds."
Mixed of old and new,"I like insadong, it has a mixture of old and new. There are plenty of eateries and the street food are cheaper than at Myeongdong shopping street. It is a must visit when in Seoul."
Fun shopping,"Lots and lots of tiny shops crammed with stuff that you don't need, but bring home anyways. I buy a coffee mug on every trip, and the one we found here may be one of my all time favorites. The salespeople aren't overbearing, just friendly. Prices seemed pretty good, and the selection was nice."
Great place to spend an afternoon ,Lots of shops that sells odds and ends among other Korean antiques. There are numerous coffee and tea houses in this area that are nice for resting your feet and to people watch. The ice cream is also a must-try.
Great Tea Shops,Very much impressed by the traditional tea shops. Great looking and the teas and snacks are great as well. 
"Great spot for finding ""traditional"" Korea","Insadong is a nice mix of old and new. Especially on the weekend, you have traditional street artists and many stores selling Korean arts and crafts. But there are also a fair number of modern restaurants and a few shopping galleries. You can easily spend over an hour just walking around and taking pictures. I'd say it's a ""must do"" for Seoul."
Beautiful Street with many tea cafes,I love spending times in this quiet little street. You can find many made in Korea souvenirs & interests toys here. Those handmade Korea souvenirs are very pretty & cheaper then others places like Myeongdong or Dongdaemun. Most of the shop owners are friendly & they don't hard-sell. When you are tired just pop in any cafe to rest & relax yourself.
Nice collection of traditional and artsy korean stores and restaurants.,"This is more like shopping at melrose than shopping at the beverly center. My daugther got a stamp made with her korean name on it; my mother-in-law bought a traditional korean fan; my boy bought some ""adventure time"" cartoon clothes patches. We ate a cheap but good chinese restaurant here as well as a restaurant well known for great steamed korean ribs with cold korean noodle broth. "
Must Go,"We spent most of our time here if we weren't visiting other sites.Good culture place, took kimchi making lessons at kimchi-kan here, bought souvenirs here (note - some are even cheaper than in myeongdong!), good food :)"
Lovely,"We went there three times as the street has such a charm! Full of art, shops and people. We bought all the souvenirs from there. "
Souvenir shopping,"Perfect for afternoon stroll, souvenir and gift shopping combined with great food and drink experience. Like many places in Seoul food here is amazing. Prices are fair..."
A Day at Insa-dong ,"Visited on a Saturday and it is full swing with people. Lots of locals and tourist. A lot of shops and unique crafts. Not to mention lots of cafes from the beginning till end.So if you are tired from all the walking, you can stop at any cafes to recharge. The little alleys at the side has some restaurants and cafes that you.might want to explore. Exit 6 from Anguk station, walk towards your left away from the police station towards the tourist information centre and you will be at Insa-dong."
Great shopping area,Visited here when we wanted to shop. Lots of arts and crafts shops. The Ssamzi mall is here to just as you walk in on the street on your left. Fun to walk down the side streets looking at all the different restaurants. A must see. 
One of my favorite neighborhoods in Seoul,"My family and I walk this area several times a year. There are several stores to buy arts and crafts, restaurants, and historic areas close by. Should you be interested, one can rent traditional Korean garments in one of the many stores. Enjoy a morning or afternoon here!"
A raining day at Insadong,"The place is like ""Petaling Street"" at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, a place where you can buy souvenirs, craft and arts for friends. Nothing extraordinary, the streets are just like any normal street in the nearby area. Prices can be varied, depending on your bargaining power."
Cute area to visit,"Very cute area to visit, loads of little shops, coffee places, handicraft places, etc. Very korean style too. nice to wander around."
Not just touristy knick-knacks if you take your time and keep your eyes open,"This is a traditional street with antique vendors, touristy shops, as well as food stalls. Because it's ""traditional,"" all the signs are in Hangul (Korean alphabet)...even Starbucks is spelled out in Korean. LOL. You'll end up missing out on a ton if you just walk down the main street. Don't be afraid to walk down some of the side alleys because that's where some of the best shops are. You can get some gorgeous handmade art/jewelry/paintings at a reasonable price (note: the stores along the main street, especially at the start of the street, tend to be especially touristy and extra pricey). If you're into bargain shopping, I recommend that you go down the street first and price out the items that caught your eye and then actually make the purchase on a walk back up the street - especially for touristy stuff, prices can vary quite a bit and I'm not that good at bargaining. The best finds, though, tend to be in the alley shops. Also, try some fried Korean pancake (hotteok) or fried veggies/meats/etc (twiggim) along the way at one of the many street vendors (but don't expect to see them around before 11:30 am)."
For culture lovers ,It's a local shopping street. I recommend it for people that likes to see other cultures. شارع لسوق محلي. وأدوات محلية الصنع أوصي به لجميع محبي استكشاف حضارات الآخرين. 
another place for shopping Korean sovenirs,"It is nice but in my opinion it is a bit overrated.You can find cheaper stuffs in Namdaemun. The Ssamji-gil inside Insadong is more interesting.However ,goods are more expensive there too."
Great shopping. Tons of shops and food. ,"Tons and tons and tons of shops selling Korean souvenirs, crafts and arts. Plenty of food and street stall options too. There are also a lot of art galleries to explore and appreciate works from talented Korean artists. "
Isadong,"This area is for tourist, there are a lot of cafes, restaurants, and shops for souveniers, nice to walk around, stop for drink, or food, a lot of people/tourist"
Nice but overrated,"Our hotel was just of Insadong so we strolled/walked by every evening. It is a lively mix of eateries / coffee shops and shops, but nothing exciting"
peaceful,"sipping hot ginger tea in a tea house one floor above, made for coolness, peace and great people watching. "
Lovely,"Really liked this area,especially all the little alleys with lots of small restaurants. Best place for buying souvenirs, for sure as it offers the largest choice.Found a tiny place serving fried dumplings-fantastic for a quick and cheap lunch!There is a kind of a shopping mall with shops offering quirky, hand-made items, very colourful and fun."
Lovely Insadong,I always love going to insadong area. I love the unique shops and souvenirs. I also ate at one of the back alley restaurants. I had bibimbap. Highly recommend for shopping and souvenirs. 
Over Hyped ,"This is a cute Korean place to visit, but in my opinion, I think it's over hyped. Lots of shopping and great restaurants. But all the trinkets you buy here you can find in other parts of Seoul (Myeongdong, for example) for less. I would consider this cute and commercialized. Is a great place to visit to feel like you are in a cute setting, but buy trinkets and souvenirs elsewhere. "
Crowded shopping street showcasing everything Korea.,"It is a must visit shopping street if you like to soak up the Korean atmosphere. Always crowded with locals and tourists alike. Good to walk up and down the streets and of course not forgetting the side streets and alleys. A lot of street food and restaurants around. Of course shops on both sides selling everything like clothes , skin care products, souvenirs, artwork etc etc. Some traditional and cultural shows and modern dances are also featured on the street. An iconic shopping street."
Nice stroll,"We went in the morning so the place was fairly quiet, mostly locals and students. minimum tourist. Enjoyed the nice morning walk, many souvenir shops around. Would recommend this place if you have spare time but don't come to the area specifically for it. "
An optional stop and tourist trap,"When you go to Korea, every Korean would tell you to go to Insadong. I still don't understand why except that the place is designed for tourists. There are lots of souvenir shops, expensive stalls, some pretty art galleries and a mall but in general, it is an expensive area. If you want to see Korea, go to the Namdaemun market, not to Insdong."
Bustling Seoul,"Great collection of shops and restaurants. My daughter found great interest in a music shop that had exclusive collections and music memorabilia she has not see seen before. Also, the kim chi pork stew was great."
"A plesant visit strolling around, window shopping :)","it was a perfect Sunday stroll at around lunch time. I started from Tapgol Park just off the Jong-ro 3 Ga bus stop nearby (which is worth visiting if you are coming to Insadong anyways) then walked Insadong-gil(road) towards Buckchon Hanok village. Not too many tourists, loads of cute little shops and the restaurants. Perfect shops for gifts. Definitely recommend to explore little alleyways and find ur little gems. I followed a tiny sparrow that just flew by and found myself in a beautiful traditional vegetarian restaurants alleyway. Public wifi pretty much everywhere so your smart phone maps will save you from getting lost. Tourist information is at the Insadong road if you need someone to ask questions. Definitely recommend to do Insadong and Hanok Village together on the same day. East walk. A perfect Sunday stroll."
Tourist Street ,"This was a pretty area. There was a cultural show and locals dressed up in historic Korean dress. However, it overrun with tourists. Prices were much higher than other markets. "
"When we visited, it was not very crowded.","I visited in mid-noon.It was very crowded.Early October is very crowded.When the overlap with the Chinese holidays, and very crowded."
Hidden delights off Insadong ro.,"Make sure you go down insadong 10 and turn left, down on the right is a shady tea garden with 6 local art galleries showing painting, pressed flower art, textile art and photography rotating every week or so. Also further back around insadong 5 or 7 the knife and sword museum, enter for 1000 won donation. Fantastic restaurant in the basement of the (double yellow upside down ""yy"") building. Open from 10am most closing around 8-9pm."
It's an optional,"Not many things to see here, unless you are preparing for buying lots of stuff here. I'm no a very fan of this place and I recommend to visit here if you happens to have more time in Seoul."
Shopping and eating good,"Interesting streets and allies filled with small shops and restaurants. There are many pop-up vendors selling foods and trinkets. It's like many other markets around Seoul but different. Good for souvenirs, snacks, and walking about. "
shopping & restaurants,A great area to explore. Many great restaurants and shops. We went here a couple of nights and still didn't see everything.
Crowded But Interesting,"Yes, it does contain some little alleyways, but I would not say that Insa-Dong is not quaint. By and large, it is a busy shopping and restaurant area."
The Market for the Antiques of Korea,"This Market is famous for the Antiques of Korean Dynasty, and Restaurants, it has so many restaurants in tiny by-lanes , this place a must visit for tasting local Delicacies and trust me you will relish the Experience."
"Take cash, not credit card","Cheap, bargain shopping area. Crowded place. Mainly street shop. Lots of food outlets. Credit cards are accepted in most places in Seoul but if you want to shop in this area, take cash. You may not find money changer booths, instead you need to change your money in banks. Time consuming. You can also change money in hotels but rate is not so good. Better you change money at the airport. Saturday and Sundays are bank holidays, so if you need cash, there is no way to change in hotel. ."
Great food but expensive shopping,"Loved the hidden away restaurants, Korean BBQ and dumplings are a must! Save your shopping for other places :)"
Diamond in a rough...,"You might still find it in this area. Spend at least an hour browsing the stores, restaurants and little streets.I enjoyed the antique clock and watch store on the main street. They carry a good variety of vintage watches."
Loved this place,First time to Seoul and really enjoyed walking the streets of Insadong. A must for any first time visitor.
Green Tae everything!,"Loved Insadong so much. Full of shops with beautiful traditional Korean stuff. Friendly shopkeepers, and lots of nice things to eat. We enjoyed Osulloc green ice cream and cake."
Quirky Arts & Crafts,"This is another shopping street, but has a more artsy vibe. Lots of the usual gimcrack souvenirs but there are also places selling paintings, hanbok-inspired clothes, handmade silk products, or wood carvings, not to mention quirky cute items."
Nice place but dont expect too much,"Insadong is another shopping district with lots of small back alleys. Its more of a traditional market with lots of souvenir shops and some art places. The smaller alleys also got a lot of local restaurant. Dont plan to spend several hours here and do go before lunch time.I recommend combining this with Gyeongbokgung Palace, Bukchok Hanok Village, Changdeokgung Palass"
Hispter / artsy ppl must visit,"*Pls note I Came here and by coincidence there was a street festival on, hence the 5 stars, otherwise 3.5-4 max *Very artsy area - was packed due to a multicultural street festival on with performances and street stalls. In general its a bit of a tourist trap area and stores selling hipster goods and trinkets. If it wasn't for the street festival, may only need 1.5 hours here."
INSA Hanbok Parade and fashion show weekend ,"We were here not knowing that this is the Hanbok Parade week!If you are Travelling by train station to insadong, you will surely see this artistic picture wall at the entrance/ exit to Insadong street. Many youngsters were wearing their traditional Hanbok and walking the street. We have the chance to taste the famous ancient tea prepared by their Organiser. - the lotus tea. It was good ! I am a tea lover ! This is definitely a place for those whom love to buy some traditional Korean gifts for your friends and relatives back home. For me, I love to look at the art gallery, the traditional tea houses and eating areas, shops that sell Korean Vases and bronze based traditional utensils. A must go place for first timer to Seoul. "
Has a lot of historical culture and is a tourist attraction,"There's always locals dressed in hanbok's, tourist souvenirs, and street food. I loved the couple-like alley located on the 3rd floor, this is similar to Namsan Tower. "
"Lots of nooks and crannies, trinket shopping and eathing","This is a fun area to poke around in the little shops and to get a bite to eat or drink. Lots of little mom and pop places with friendly proprietors. This isn't fancy, but that's what makes it laid back and enjoyable."
2nd Tier Priority but go if you have the time,"We were taken on our way back to the hotel from the Gyeongbokgung Palace, by a Korean speaker. So rather weary and footsore. Our experience reflects other reviews - many different aspects of shopping from the high-end stores down to little curio shops and stalls run by the artist themselves. Dress for the weather - it could be very wet, or sunny and hot - or v. cold. We had a nice Korean meal in one of the many possible places in a side alley. It's essential to go with a Korean speaker who understands the cuisine - then you could have an exquisite experience in a cosy busy family-run business.Set aside a day to do it justice - but if it doesn't appeal then move on rapidly to some other Seoul attraction. The transport links are excellent.We noticed that the top end (near the Palace) seems to be a sort of Hyde Park Corner - set aside for placarding and peaceful protestors. So don't be surprised if you have to make your way through or past a group of well-marshalled demonstrators. Also the US Embassy is nearby - so came the saying 'if you want to find a policeman in Seoul, go to the US Embassy'. There aren't many visible elsewhere; but to be fair I believe that when we visited Seoul there had recently been a 'situation' involving the Ambassador."
Korean gifts shopping(pasalubong),"We went here after visiting Nakwon Music Mall which is just within the area. Its a long street fill of gift items such as key chains, pens, fans, etc that are great items to be given away back home. As compared to gangnam or other shopping area, this is the best place to find these items as these are cheaper here especially the traditional korean dresses. But not all items here are traditional. There are alao a number of stores that sell trendy clothes from 10-25k won. Not expensive at all. If you walk straight,you'll reach ssamzigil mall which is worth the stop as it houses many shops inside. Overall, i really enjoyed this as we were able to haggle with an old man and he has even gave us with lots of freebies and big discounts. Just be nice to the sellers and im pretty sure you'll entice them to give discounts. ;)"
Hits all the right spots for a tourist,"Insadong offers almost everything you would want to see, feel and taste as a tourist in Seoul within 10 minutes of walking.Yes the area is somewhat pricy but that's just how tourist areas are in general. Thst does not mean that the quality of things to do is bad. It's easy to sort out the good stuff from the bad.Don't forget to walk the alleyways you might find something surprisingly good!"
Quaint but lacking,"I had higher hopes of Insadong with narrow old street and shops that caters to its past. The only place we enjoyed were the mask store made in the store by the owner himself but the rest were mostly designed for tourists. However, go check out the side streets where one will find amazing restaurants serving local food."
Tourist trap - but good for taking fun treats home!,if you are going to pick up knick knacks to take home - or art work - this is the place. Items are likely to be overpriced - but you will have fun shopping. 
Nice experience,"Insadong is a gorgeous place with many great food stalls along the streets, Insadong also has super cute shops that sell traditional Korean paper, art, clothes and more. A great place to take photos as well, Insadong is also a short walk away from Gyeongbokgung Palace."
Shoppers love it, Bad for the guys as there are a multitude of shops selling everything from garbage to new antiques.. The rain was a problem so you had to enter the stores. We loved it
Tourist trap ,"Like most cities, this is one of Seouls traps. It's nice but nothing to write home about. Easy to get to by metro, with many eateries - also if you into set, good expensive place for supplies. "
Good Shops,"This part of Seoul has many high quality shops that have beautiful and authentic items. Even if you can resist buying, it's a great place to wander. "
Enjoyed the experience,"There is a main road with alleys on each side, where you will see shops selling traditional stuff, cafes, art galleries. Somewhere in the middle there is Ssamji-gil, a traditional cultural shopping complex with a couple of levels. We went in the evening, and enjoyed the slow walk and soft breeze down the main road, browsing through the Korean traditional art/goods, and stopped by Osulluc for a tea and cake break. "
Food lover and souvenior shopping,"At first , you can find many locals there,too they seemed to enjoy the place! It has many traditional cafe, restaurants, souvenior shops, art craft shops, handcraft shops, etc! I love O'sullok green tea house most where you can buy green tea products and order green tea desserts! I ate green tea cake and latte with my family! I loved it a lot : ) I and my sister still want to eat these! so miss them!"
"For foody, this place will be great!","If you are looking for good restaurants in Korea, then this place will be really lovely! I tried Korean noodle and dumpling, Hanjeongsik(Kind of set menu with a lot of dishes), Ddeokbbokki, etc. All food there were really good, I still craving them! For souvenior, you can find many shops there,too! "
Cultural Experience,"If you want to see the more of Korea's culture from a more traditional point of view, then Insadong is the place to go. The main street that most people go to is full of shops where you can see different sides of Korea. You could be looking at a shop full of beautifully made Korean traditional wear and then be looking inside a more modern accessory shop right after. And if you're looking for souvenirs to get for your beloved peeps, then this is a good place to find something. With such an array of different items from different styles, there's bound to be something that catches your eye as the perfect gift.If you go around asking a bit, you can also find places that will rent our Hanboks (traditional Korean garments) for you to wear around and also to take pictures in. There are other places where you can do this, but this is also an option at Insadong.Now, the more fun and gimmicky things will require just a tad bit more looking. The main street in Insadong is pretty straight forward with what it's going to give you. However, once you slip into the smaller nooks and crannies, you'll find some interesting things that will definitely keep you entertained. Insadong is one of the most flexible places to visit in Korea. I say this because anyone can come and have a good time. It's a safe place for families to visit, has it's own interesting quirks that'll keep a group of friends laughing, offers exhibitions and shops that are perfect for solo travelers. Insadong is somewhere that should be visited at least once if there is time during your trip."
See some nice old buildings and culture,A good place to spend half a day and the best place for original and historical souvenirs from Korea. Also the nearby temples make this a place with visiting as it's near the main Palace. Also worth visiting are the traditional Korean house Street about fifteen minutes walk from the subway. 
Find a native to take you,"In addition to the excellent shopping opportunities, there are a large number of incredible restaurants in the alleys. We never would have found them on our own, but my d-I-l is Korean. I couldn't tell you the names of the restaurants but they were great. Find a local and enjoy!"
Great afternoon,"An afternoon well spent at Insadong - browsing art and craft supplies, eating 'king's sweets' and listening to their hilarious song, and watching various artisans at work. Funky area and plenty of unique things to buy, would highly recommend this area."
handicraft and souvenirs shops.,"this place for handicraft and souvenirs shops.you can buy what you need from handicraft and souvenirs , but for me we got disappointed ,because we going to insadong at night 9 pm ,and we thought the market still work but we got only a few shops still open ,so don't visit this place at night .."
Great place to see culture and anything Korean,We were here on a Sunday. There were a lot of really in love Korean couples and they're just cute to watch in their matchy outfits and sweetness to each other. This is a great place to feel their culture. There are a lot of shops and restaurants and food stalls. It's also a good place to buy souvenirs. There are nearby hotels/rentals in the area also.
Nice souviners but a little bit expensive,We were a little bit tired but bought some nice cheap bags (there is a shop that has unified price: 10 000 for all bags; nice models - of course not excellent quality but nice variety and shapes)Finally we ate at a near buy mcdonalds (shrip burger) as we need halal food. There were an indian restaurant claiming halal food but we didnt prefer it since it sells wine and beer so not trustworthy as halal food seller.
"Live, hadicrafts and colorful","Along the main Insadong street there are so many handicraft and souvenirs shops. In the small streets there are also lots of different types of restaurants, mainly Korean styles. It is a great location to visit Seoul's city center, if you don't mind walking, you can go on foot to most of the city center points of interest."
Nice Place,We went here to buy korean souvenirs and yes this is the place. Many chooses. Also we can find the kitchen utinsels made from woods. Very nice.
Best part of Seoul!,"Insadong is my favorite area of Seoul! There are a lot of tiny shops, Tea salons, and the required street vendors. Several coffee shops are along the Main Street as well. However, where the areas shines is the art exhibition spaces (Insa Art Center being one of the better ones).You can run into Buddhist monks from the nearby temple, artists, tourists from all over, and even people who will write your name in Chinese calligraphy on paper, fans, anything handy.Check out the stationery stores. Buy some postcards of k-pop stars. Try some bondaeggi. Watch the guys making the royal candy. It's a fun place to spend the day. Around the corner is a palace (see the changing of the guard) and a temple ( light some incense), and the business district."
"Busy, great if you poke around a little","I visited as part of a tour the Saturday before Thanksgiving week so things were busy. There was an interesting blend of very exclusive shops - high end and very beautiful celadon, for instance - and cheap and cheerful. Quote touristy but definitely worth it, with some lovely eating places. "
Touristy but fun,"Great location, near the palace and palace museum - an easy walk between the two. Lots of cafes and small restaurants on this street. There were more souvenir shops than I would have liked but also some nice shops and some DIY art/crafts places. Looked fun foe kids who will be in Seoul for a longer period. "
Traditional Korean Street,The go-to place for experiencing traditionally Korean culture and there are a lot of tradition restaurants and cafe in the area
Very skillful chicken skewer,It becomes my favourite street stall. It is from the direction of Jongno-3-ga to enter Insadong. The lady has so much patience to grill the skewer. We had 3 sticks on that day.
Seoul,I and family did not like this market. We waist our time there. There are no good shops there. Most of shops are empty
Great walking street to spend the afternoon,"This is a great fun street with food and interesting shops, not just tourist trinkets but Korea has a lot of old stuff shops that are really fun to go through for those one of a kind things, It is easy to come to this street more then once"
Interesting streets of Seoul,"Stores were selling mostly Korean utensils, scarves and other souvenirs. Might be quite boring for teens who are looking to shop for trendy things. I believe it is because Insadong is located near the Gyeongbokgung Palace which is a major tourist site. Lots of cafes and eateries are located along the streets of insadong. A nice place for stroll and even view some street performances along the way. "
Arts and Crafts area,"This neighborhood mainly sells the traditional arts and crafts souvenirs. Very peaceful, relaxed pace, and not as crowded as any neighborhood shopping street. I got my own korean seal stamp here! Recommended for those who are into history and arts."
Overrated,I understand this place is famous for buying souvenirs. We walked passed here while on our way back to our hotel. We did not buy anything because nothing really catch our attention here.
Try the alleyways of the main street,"You need a bit of time to explore Insadong and the surrounding alleyways properly. Get there by metro and get off at the Anguk station.This district is also located between Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces so you may like to combine a visit to the palaces in the morning with lunch and afternoon shopping in Insa-dong, which is what we did.Get down the side streets and surrounding alleyways. We also did a nighttime food tour in this area and were surprised by what we did not see during the previous day time visit.The Main Street itself"
Too touristy,"This street used to sell antiques in the olden days. That was gone so you would find more touristy stuff like post cards, hanbook, food. If you would like to buy real authentic korean antiques you can check 1 brand Tong In. good to visit. "
"Quaint streets, restaurants and interesting little stores","This a delightful place for people who like to shop in small stores in a market atmosphere. Lots of reasonable priced colorful clothes and hats for women. Tons of souvenirs. Lovely restaurants hidden in alleyways. And there is a special ""Free Market"" which is a structure of at least 4 levels of tiny craft shops, some of which sell the most delightfully designed crafts, scarves, jewelry, ornaments etc. A mixture of old and state of the art in crafts...And I actually found a vegan restaurant in one of the alleys."
Overpriced and not what it once was,It has been taken over by beauty shops and is nothing like it used to be. Skip this part of Seoul and spend money elsewhere.
Insa dong,"The main street is pretty amazing. Full of souvenirs, street food, people doing magic tricks, it was pretty fun."
Great shopping,"Lots of choices, and some nice hotels in the area. Only thing really lacking were public garbage cans, which led to more street litter."
Souvenirs and antiques item shopping street with lesser crowd,"There are a lot of antique shops here. There are also several souvenirs shop but they are a bit pricey than Namdaemun. I went here just for sightseeing, the whole street is cool and calm as not much crowd is here compared to Namdaemun. We found shops selling bags for 10000 won. There are some decent bags available."
Cool neighbourhood,Insadong is a cool nieghbourhood in Seoul with one main street for shopping and dining. We walked through the main street from Jongmo 3 station on the way to Bukchon Village. Worth the detour.
Must visit ,"If this is your first or even second time in Korea I highly recommend visiting Insadong. Is it touristy? Yes, but still a great district where you can buy traditional souvenirs, eat traditional food and try traditional tea. Also there are a lot of volunteers wearing all red. You can ask any of them for help. I also recommend exploring some of the more hidden restaurants and tea shops that are in alleys or basements. 5 stars. Go."
"expensive shops, souvenirs","There wasn't really much to do. Many shops sell souvenirs, but more expensive compared to places like Namdaemun market. If you are interested in traditional shops, this street might be something for you. There are many tourists here and also many brand named shops."
Favorite Place to Take Guests for Shopping,"Even as someone who lives in Seoul, I always love coming here with guests! So many fun shops, great places to eat and fun things to see! The street is quite quaint despite being in the busy city (no cars drive down this area) and you can find all the perfect gifts to take back home with you! And the calligraphy shops!! Don't even get me started!! :)"
Over-rated......,It's a tourist trap. Don't bother. The street is lined with antique shops but the prices are exorbitant and the products themselves are usually mixed in with cheap tourist memorabilia.
Art Village in Seoul,"Insadong is a well known artistic district of Seoul where traditional Korean art and culture are represented in small reflections. Modern artistic expressions and artisans' products are also represented, to a lesser degree. Visitors can participate in cultural activities and events, buy ""Korean souvenirs"" such as jewelry boxes, neckties, paintings and antiques, and a variety of cultural artifacts. If you are interested in artistic or cultural aspects of Korea rather than endless drinking that Koreans are known to do, be sure to budget sufficient time to stroll at Insadong! You should visit not only the streets but entire buildings where artists showcase their expressions; you will always treasure this little reality."
Common Shopping Area,"The products selling are are quite commercial and not in style. However, if you just wish to buy some traditional Korean gits back to your hometown, it is a very good place for you to do crazy shopping. It is because almost all the shops along the shopping streets selling similar products. Frankly speaking, not very attractive to me. For the Korean food, of course, there are various kinds of choices around those small lanes area."
Souvenir Shopping for the Artist Soul,"Clustered along one street is a good cross section of higher quality souvenir shops and small artists and craftsmen displaying original pieces and custom fashions. This was our favorite place for small and big purchases that were useful, beautiful, and will remind us for Korea for a long time."
A Trendy and energetic place,"A lovely shopping center which no need to walk by stairs but you can from ground floor walk to roof garden area. Amazing area for shopping and a lot of native goods and foods. You can go their by metro at station Anguk exit 6, then walk about 2 min."
Traditional Place,You can find any Korean traditional products and goods here. Great souvenir shop and lovely place to walk and shop.
Nice Hand Craft Shops and worth visiting ,"We visited Insadong shopping street after that visited Bukchon traditional houses and in our way back ate in Subway restaurant. My family and I enjoyed the walk from Myongdong and liked the art in the hand craft and souvenirs shops. Korean people are really nice and they offer using their private bathrooms free of charge in the old village ""Bukchon"". The old Korean houses are small and beautiful made from stone and wood. I loved it "
Lovely Insadong,"What a quaint, lovely shopping street. Lots of cafes, restaurants, souvenirs and interesting shops. Easy to access. One of my very favorite places in Seoul."
One of my favourite neighbourhoods in Seoul.,"Insadong is a great area to explore, take photos, browse for souvenirs or just take a break from the day. There are lots of cozy little restaurants and bars - so much to see and do! Don't miss Insadong on your trip to Seoul."
Our favorite area,We loved the cultural street so much we were back 3 times during our stay. Great shopping and food and atmosphere.
Great shopping!,"This walking street is chock full of everything from inexpensive souvenirs, to lovely clothes and jewelry. Down the side alleys are many restaurant options."
Should visit in Seoul,"Insadong is famous street to both locals and tourists. We went to Insadong on the weekend evening, the street was full crowded, but I felt very excited and energy fully. There are a lot of shops, which sell vary of things as antique, art galleries and traditional stationery. If you want to buy some presents for friends and family, you should go to Insadong, many lovely souvenirs. In general, you can buy at a small lower than the price offer of sellers."
Tourist street and nearby temple ,"Interesting tourist street with lots of small shops and street stalls. Good place to get bargains and please do bargain.... Souvenirs, cosmetics and clothing shops aplentyAside from the usual touristy shopping there is some sightseeing to do here.. There is a grand Buddhist temple nearby that's worth a visit..."
Tat and more tat,The worst shopping experience I have had in the Far East . One shop after another selling overpriced tat
2 wonderful hours,Insadong is a small area at Anguk station. Our group had kids and teens. Therevis enough to keep kids and teens happy. It is however a comercial area and filled with shops and eateries. We spent a nice two hours walking around on a cool august afternoon.
Hip shopping area,"A slightly different shopping experience as it has more artsy type of shops, rather than your usual Street shops selling t-shirts and shoes. Plenty of dessert and novelty shops which can be interesting."
From an Art to a Souvenirs street,"Four years back I would have given 5 stars to this place it was the art district of Seoul - great art galleries, great place to buy Korean art with interesting small eating joints. But when I visited the place this time it has been converted a place for Chinese tourist to buy Souvenirs (which incidentally made in China). It is slowly losing its charm. Sad. "
Great Shopping,"So many place that you can go in insadong. There are so many shop, restaurant. and u can find for souvenir here"
Korean handicraft and souveniers,"A great place to buy unique souvenirs antiques and art. Don't forget to drop by the Ssamziegil. It's a four story inside shopping center with small shops selling hand-made products such as jewelry, clothing, and even candles. How to get there: Seoul Metro Line 1, Jonggak Station, Exit 3. Go towards Jogyesa temple and enter the alley next to the 7th Day Sabbath Church. Ssamziegil is ahead on your left."
A mix of young & old,"Take time to stroll down the street with shops on two sides. There are many ""art shops"" and you find one or two interesting art pieces. There are also some stores run by younger Koreans so it's a mixture of arty stuff. Found a Cat Cafe, but didn't check it out as i caught a flu earlier on. Had lunch at Miss Lee Cafe at 2F #144 Gwanghun-Dong, Jongno-Gu. Traditional Korean kimchi rice served in a metal box. You can leave messages/drawings on the wall or tied up on the paper tree. Check it out :)"
An Interesting Place to Meander About,"Insadong is a neat little place in Seoul that offers a variety of shopping. From trinkets to traditional Korean goods, there isn't much that can't be found here. I wouldn't say it's a particularly exciting place to spend time, but its streets are nice, and especially at night, there is a quaint charm to them.If you're looking to stock up on some souvenirs during a trip to Seoul, I would recommend coming to Insadong. You have to look past all of the mass-produced junk that a lot of peddlers are trying to sell, but in these streets, there are some real gems. Ssamji-gil has a few neat shops, for example, and the last time I was in Insadong, I bought some cheap paintings ($10 each) from a man doing art on the side of the street.Just keep your eyes (and your wallet) open, and you'll be able to find some interesting goods."
Nice Vibe with all sorts of Quainty shops ,"All sorts of gifts,art lovers and couples would love it. Shopping street very busy at night with variety of gift + souveniers to be found. Lovers paradise with different eateries. Bargains can be found here eg handbags,sport bags,backpacking bags at very low prices. A must visit when in KoreA"
Interesting place to eat and seek treasures,We stayed in Insadong and found it most interesting and accessible. If only we'd had more time to try more of the eateries. I would definitely stay here on my next visit.
Insadong ,"It is a very nice place where you will see many Korean food restaurants, many coffee shops like Starbucks and other shops. It is good place for walking and discover Korea culture. My advice to you, if you want to touch the Korean lifestyle, visit Insadong."
A lot of things you didn't know you needed!,Very artistic place. You have everything here and restaurants. There is an indoor shopping area and an out shopping area. 
Nice city - walking around + food,"It is a nice place to shop, eat and be happy during summer :)If you enjoy shopping, this will be a nice place, with a blend of old and new style."
Small shopping street with interesting shops,"Many shops sell souvenir items. However, the most interesting shop I've ever seen, was a Poo Museum in one of the plazas. It was basically an indoor play area for kids with a poo theme. Very bizarre but funny."
Souvenirs,"Great place for souvenirs, they sell alot of korean traditional artifacts, pass this place when you travel on your way to Bukchon. We walked from insadong to Bukchon and had a great time with the whole views and traditional houses."
Place to get souvenir and local made goods.,"I got many cute fridge magnets and many arts galleries surrounding this area. Have a slow walk of a day, sure you will get something interesting handycraft to bring back home."
Nice place for tourists,Good street for souvenirs and handicraft shopping. We were here in the afternoon after visiting Bukchon area. Its a lively place. 
Changed a lot,"Insa-dong has changed a lot. It was a quiet and cultural quarter some ten years ago, with old shops selling writing brushes, traditional paper, and boutiques artful handmade products. Nowadays, new shopping centre and restaurants opened, it is more lively but too touristy sadly."
Wonderful Artsy and Hip City,"Excellent night life, phenomenal street food, good hiking areas nearby, great for shopping, perfect for couples "
Good place to shop Korean traditional gifts,"Love Insadong. Every time I come to Korea, I always visit here at least once. You can find traditional Korean stuff at a reasonable price. Also you will find good place to eat and tons of tea houses. Fun place to check out"
street shops,its a great place to buy souvenirs you have different choices there are some coffee shops also. there are a small mall called ssamziegil it has a great small shops and in the first floor they have a poop cake you should try it
Nice for a stroll and souvenir shopping,"We spent an hour here - nice place for a walk, few galleries to see and also good place to buy souvenirs! "
great walking streets,"lot of souvenirs and cafes on this street, walking street only so it was a really nice escape from the busy streets of Seoul. We tried o sulloc tea house with great matcha ice cream, latte matcha and cake. Would recommend to try if you are a matcha fan :-)"
"Great place for souvenirs, excellent place for contemporary galleries.",Not much more to be said than has already been written. Excellent mix of tourist trap and unique boutique. Great place to buy souvenirs for home and check out contemporary painters.
Surprisingly Good Time,I had heard of this area but somehow thought it would be overrated. Not so! Lots to see and do. Lots of art galleries to discover. Plenty of restaurants (and yummy food) It's also probably the best place in Seoul to go for souvenirs at any price point. There is a Sulloc tea shop and places to get jewelry or traditional Korean crafts.
"Nice stroll, not for shopping but the artifacts","Go there have a walk and enjoy different artifacts vendors, maybe have a Korean desert. There are a lot of shops but no street food.Its close to other attractions and markets"
OK,We went here at 11 am and I did not think it was different. but it was on our way to the Korean museum.
Great for shopping arts and crafts,This really is the best place to buy arts and crafts whilst in Seoul. We shopped around and made a point of returning to Insadong because the choice was by far the best. There is always something to see - make sure to explore the side streets where excellent restaurants and tea houses can be found. There are bargains to be had because competition between outlets is fierce. We haggled ( politely but firmly) and got some excellent bargains. 
Loved insadong ,"A cute and quaint alley!! Loved the shopping, the outside mall area and the traditional tea houses. Definitely try the tea in Insadong. It was a fun day out. best of all, there is a pure vegetarian Korean restaurant for all the veg and vegan tourists. It was just so so so tasty!!! Highly recommend that. "
Artsy and Korean Traditional stuff,"One of my favorite place to visit on all my trips to Seoul is Insadong, I love the atmosphere here and there's so many shops around for all your shopping needs, be it cosmetics, souvenirs, handicrafts, food, clothes, accessories, etc.. anything and everything.The streets are also not overly crowded and there's lots of traditional elements around, it's very artistic. Sometimes, you can also spot street performances.The food shops here are also great, lots of traditional and modern eating and drinking places, too many variety to pick from. It's really a great place to hang out for hours and never get bored."
This is a trendy area that you don't want to miss,I have meet my private tour guide from a web call TravoAsia. Kim was a very nice Korea girl who born locally in Seoul. She bought me to this area and took me to lunch there. I was surprise by the shop and food that she brings me. There are many hidden place to visit around this area. Highly recommend that you have a local to bring you visit around. Have a lovely day. Thanks Kim
Best shopping for mix of traditional korean style with modern flair.,This was my favorite place to shop because it had edgy Korean designers that mix traditional influences. Great place to check out Korean trends and also old school style as well. 
Feast your eyes with Korean art stuff,"The whole street is packed with stores, galleries and restaurants that will amaze you especially if you love their traditional artcrafts. This is the place where you can buy small presents to bring home which is more cheaper than other places since you buy by bulk. Make sure to visit every shop sonce most of them sell different and unique pieces."
Too Touristy,This area was too touristy for me....but its busy and full of tourist shops and an easy walk from either of the two big palaces. 
Charming neighbourhood!,The neighbourhood is full of quirks and surprises. Good very traditional as well as the hipster things to do!
Nice!,"you can enjoy the traditional korean tea, food..etc. If you visit Seoul, you must come here! 인사동 볼거 많은 곳이죠. 그렇지만 저녁이나 주말은 사람들이 지나치게 많으므로 피하시길 바랍니다. 외국인들도 많아서 정말 걷기도 힘들어요."
Antique Street.,"if you looking for Antique Street, please go to Insadong ( near Gyeongbokgung Palace) this please including traditional Korean restaurants, tea houses and galleries full of antique artifacts and local art.please set the full day for this place."
"If you love art, this is the place to be",This place is where all artists and galleries are. Great place to be to see all the different Korean artists and their distinctive arts.
Good area for shopping,"Although there are some tourist traps in the area, if you start looking down the side streets you can find some great shops in the area. I did my christmas shopping there for the whole family and came back with a range of things from prints, to boutique art store gets, and then traditional Korean trinkets from the old antique stores. There is also some good food to be found in the area such as seafood dumplings (mandu) or of course soups. At one end of the street you'll also find yourself near some of the royal palaces, so definitely worth a visit!"
Birth place of Seoul but with tourist traps,"If you are first time visitor to Seoul or South Korea in general, then chances are you will read in a traveling brochure or website visit Insadong since it is, generally speaking, the birthplace of Seoul. Most of the traditional items have all been commercialized and overpriced. The city does provide some traditional entertainment with music, costumes and live shows traveling down the street. In short, visit it, take your pictures, purchase an item or two, have a coffee and head somewhere else."
Too much commercialized,"Insadong is too much commercialized these days; there are too many shops, foods are expensive, and there aren't many ""traditional"" things to see. "
Various kind of food for selection.,Special food and the price is fair. There is a Han Jeung Mak (Korea Sweat steam curtains ) in Ikseon-dong.
Pretty chill place,Nice cafes and restaurants littered throughout. Found a very quaint rustic authentic teahouse nestled in a corner. Reached a little too late in the evening but otherwise great place to chill.
Loved Insadong!,"This place was so cute and there was SO much to see! I really loved the unique boutiques. I found a new purse, gifts for friends back home, kids' toys, pet toys, and so much more! We also ate at a great Korean BBQ restaurant, visited the hysterical Poo Poo Land, and got our pictures taken in traditional hanboks (Korean dresses). There were a lot of people and the sheer number of stores can be overwhelming, but it is worth a visit."
Fun,This place is really nice and entertain you will find a lot of souvenirs with a good price. you will find some delicious foods too.
A good walk but nothing more,"Looking for souvenirs - go to namdemun, for cosmetics - go to myeongdong, for clothes go to dongdemun. Insadong is just a good walk (best combined with a trip to gyeongbokgung palace) "
"Found unique, cooling looking coffee mugs for $5.50",Went on a Saturday afternoon for a leisurely walk for a couple of hrs and found three sets of ceramic coffee mugs that were half off and great for gift giving. 
Great tourist spot,"It is touristy, but in a good way. Plenty of Korean souvenirs to collect, lots of little shops on little streets. It is very charming, old, traditional Korean stuff with great original local arts and crafts. A great contrast from the glittering cosmopolitan Seoul city. "
Great place to shop.,Ate at two good restaurants in this area on two different days. Also a good place for shopping. This is a good place to visit in between visiting the two palaces.
Loved this,"Of all Seoul neighborhoods this is a top 3. Many shops and easy to walk around. Food is not expensive. Others areas like Myeongdong, Hongdae are as fun and enjoyable. Close to many attractions."
Nice to walk around the place,"It's a pedestrian street with small shops on the sides, selling similar things. A few small restaurants looked nice, but we did not try them. We had very good shaved ice at a nice desert shop there. Overall it's nice to walk around there if you have time, but not a must-go place."
"""Cultural place to visit""","Its a nice and interesting street to visit. Take your time. You can see many antique art and book stores, traditional teahouses, and craft shops."
Nice evening stroll,"Walked from insadong to myeongdong after dinner. It's one looooong straight street down, . Preferred the quaint vibes of insadong, how the architecture is unique and how its is less crowded compared to myeong dong. Worth to visit!"
Definitely worth visiting!,"We were staying at Isadong. We walked around the Insadong-gil which is a traditional / old street that combined the past and the present. It has a mixture of historical and modern atmosphere and is an unique area of Seoul. The majority of the buildings on the street are shops or of commercial use. The area is well known for sightseeing, there’s a street market on the weekend and it is filled with local and overseas visitors. The area also has a lot of old antique shops and art galleries as well as traditional stationery shops. I’m particular intrigued by the calligraphy shoes and stone stamps."
Worth checking out!,Great place to see old architecture and check out some quaint local stores. Can get a bit crowded towards the top of the hill (be prepared to walk). 
Nice for a stroll,"Very touristic, lots of souvenirs shops but also lots of place for eating. Ssamsilgil is a must-go if you are in Insadong. O'Sulloc is also a good place for a break. "
My favorite street,"This is my favorite street in Seoul as it has a wonderful atmosphere and great mix of korean art, design, clothes, items and of course your normal souvenir stores but you quickly see which ones to avoid. There are also lots of very good restaurants. I think we had dinner in this area at least 5 times and they were all very good."
Nice,"It was nice, one of my favourite restaurants is located here. But it's not really the ultimate place to go shopping. You'll find a lot of tourism stuff and souvenirs here, and there exists one bigger alley-ish place where the stuff are handmade but way overpriced."
Nice and local for tourists,Nice place for local and chic shopping. Love the lovely mall. Nice Bibimbab underground. Cute cupcake with Poo styles. 
A tourist street like any other,"When any place is marketed as a street for tourists, everything you see is guaranteed to be overpriced. Do not buy souvenirs here (or haggle haggle haggle) as they will cost you double of what you could pay at other markets like Namdaemun. It's an interesting street for a stroll and close to other attractions such as Bukchon and the palaces, but not a critical place to visit."
I love this place,The street has a lot of beautiful traditional shops and items. We just walk around and picked a restaurant for lunch. It turned out to be the best meal with affordable price for my whole trip at Seoul. We also went to tried Hanbok at culture centre with a small fee (sufficient for us to fool around with Hanbok ) 
The place to get Korean art,Nice place to get traditional Korean art work for your home. We loved this place so much that we visited it twice during our visit. Lots of great shopping and a decent place to eat. I highly recommend. It is very difficult to acquire a taxi from here during rush hour.
Tourist Spot,"Insadong is mainly a shopping spot for various souvenirs. There's so many different types of gifts, it's fantastic, definitely go at least twice."
A taste of Old Seoul,"In a city filled with artificially designed tourist traps, this area is among the few places that are actually worth visiting as a tourist. It is very easy to forget that Seoul, and for that matter Korea, is more than about twenty years old. Insadong is one of those few reminders. That being said, it is a sight, and the shops are all designed to cater to tourists, so there isn't much to DO there. As a walking destination though it is most certainly worth a visit."
"Bustling, Touristy Neighborhood","This is another of the many bustling shopping and restaurant areas of Seoul. There is always a lot going on here: street food, shops, restaurants. The people-watching is great! You can easily access this area by subway."
Vibrant street of shopping and eating,"This is one place in Seoul that one should not miss. Full of activities n eateries n one can never get tired of the cultural activities there. The staff at the shops were helpful, especially to non Korean speaking tourists. The ice cream n coffee cafes arelovely places for one to sit n gaze at the passer bys."
Fun Place to Visit in Seoul,"We visited several times when we were in Seoul. The place is a little touristy as historic streets go, but we always had fun. There were street performers, lots of street food, and vendors selling antique and not-so-antique items. There are lots of shops and restaurants to experience and explore. "
Pleasant,Souvenir shops and restaurantsalley ways all seem to contain more restaurants-one wonders how they all survivetypical souvenir shops-worth visiting but certainly not a priority
quaint and interesting,Went to the Tourist information centre and then the shopping area. Lots of quaint shops with handicrafts around Insa-dong. Bought some lovely tea cups. Found this more interesting than the other shopping areas.
Tourist area with nice tea houses,"The street hosts some nice shops but also your run of the mill tourist shops. It is interesting to see the sweet honey dessert makers. We also saw quite a few people in Korean outfits on their way to the palace (= free entrance). Tucked away off the main street are some really nice traditional style Korean tea houses. We were told this is a must while in Seoul, but if time is short you may as well skip this place. The palace and the presidents blue house are nearby, if you have a car."
Quite a fun place to wander around at night,"Lots of little restaurants tucked away in the alleyways, and some stalls selling local knickknacks, good for souvenir shopping. "
Cat Cafe,Lots of souvenir shops. Tours often include this as a stop. Our favorite was the Cat Cafe where you can have tea or coffee and pet the cats.
favorite place in seoul,Too many tourists and everything is overpriced but this is one of my favorite places in Seoul. You can spend hours wandering around the narrow streets and find yourself drunk and eating pigs' feet... 
"Nice shopping area, but very touristic","Take your time and do not buy immediately, since prices are dropping further down the latest line. Worth at leadt an hour of strolling around."
souvenir,"this is the place where you go to buy souvenirs. it's good to try bargain with them, especially if you're buying more than one thing. "
Love Insadong!,I love Insadong and its environment. Not as crowded as Myeondong market and easily to navigate around. There's even nice cafe and ALIVE museum
Traditional Seoul!,Go to Insadong to enjoy the traditional Korea. Nice place to shop for souvenir with good price. Street art performance in the evening.
Great gifts at a low price.,There is a wide assortment of stores and items to purchase. I bought a doll for $35 usd in the Korean craft store on the corner. The did a beautiful job gift wrapping it. A similar one was $50 usd in the hotel gift shop. I found small silk cloth drawstring bags for a dollar each. Fun place to look around.
Nice quiet area to shop for souvenirs,"There are a lot of different shops, for all tastes. Walking along the small pedestrian streets, bordered with small boutiques is a pleasant way to shop and stop for a coffee in kawai coffee shops. Charming area on Sundays, where locals go for a walk too, with romantic couples buying bouquet of flowers."
Charming neighbourhood,"Insadong is a quaint and charming neighbourhood of stalls selling traditional crafts. Good for getting unique souvenirs for your friends and family back home. I got a paper fan from a traditional paper shop for a good price and pouches from another shop. Check out Ssamziegil as well, a shopping complex that spirals all the way to the top without the need for stairs. Lots of fascinating shops around, including a poop cafe. Jogyesa and Tapgol Park are nearby as well."
Great place for people with a bent of art,When we stayed here for 10 days we had a great time walking around in the evenings after dinner catching various local artists perform (from music to magic shows etc.)
Shopping Street For Tourist,"This is a famous street at Seoul, which very well known as a shopping street for tourist. Here we can see so many store sell for souvenir and other stuff but a bit pricy because this is a tourist attraction. Very nice street to visit and enjoy the atmosphere.."
Good area to stroll through,"Insadong area has many tourist shops along the main thoroughfare but by the cheap stands where you almost feel like the shop owners are begging you for your money. Nice area, clean and safe."
Perfect place to buy souveniers,"So basically this is a shopping street and it is full of shops that sell traditional Korean things that make great souvenirs. There is also a small outside mall on the way. All the shops have their names written in Korean, even Starbucks."
Nice area for shopping and dining,If you visit Insadong try to find the multifloor art and craft centre which is packed with interesting and unusual tiny shops. Also good shops and restaurants all over the place. 
Good selection market,"We found there was a much of a muchness at this market, affording some variety and choice, but more expensive than other markets we had been to. You have to admire how quickly they translate their Won price into the currency you are carrying, and we found them a little pushy. The street traders were better and more fun to deal with in the short time we were there."
Overpriced,It was interesting to walk down the street but compared with other areas (especially if you have access to shop outside of Osan Air Base) the stores seemed really overpriced. We ate at a restaurant on a side street that had a totally different price on the menu than what we ended up paying. Look around in other areas before buying stuff here.
Interesting stroll,"Come here for a nice walk and some hotteok! I first got some hotteok at Myeongdong but that was pretty bad. But the one from Insadong, a-ma-zing! Even my sad who's not fond of sweets loved it! You have to try it. Other than that, if you're interested in art and traditional trinkets, Insadong has them. Brushes and all that. There's also a bran of sulbing here so you can drop by and rest while having some bingsu. Injeolmi is still the best!"
Worth a vidit,Compared to places like Namdaemun market or Dongdaemun market this place is more artsy and slightly more upmarket You get to buy pretty souvenirs and trinkets. There's a small mall full of handmade crafts that are unique but naturally cost more. The small streets have an old feel to it and good for taking pictures. You probably need about 1-1.5 hours to explore this area. There's a palace within walking distance that you can visit while you are at Insadong.
Souvenirs market,"You can buy souvenirs at Insa-dong market with much cheaper price than Myeongdong and Dongdaemun. Find magnetic memo holder, keychain, chopstick, spoon, fork and many more with discount from seller if you buy many items."
"Lots of cafes, restaurants, and gift shops. It's your all-in-one place.","I love this area because it offers so much. It's the only place where all buildings have Korean title stores including the ONLY Starbucks store written in Korean. Cafes serve lots of traditional drinks and food is delicious. Then after all that, there's gift shops everywhere to buy all you need. It's also located right by the traditional Gyeongbokgung palance."
Variety & Western Feel...,Lots of different types of restaurants and shops. If you come to this area you will find variety. There is something for everyone. 
Pleasant stroll into tradition,"Much like anywhere else in the world, souvenir shops are full of the same old, made in China, cheaply produced good. On the opposite side, Insadong is a very pleasant place full of restaurants, traditional tea cafes, interesting art and much more. A must-see if you are in Seoul."
So quaint ,"We stayed in Insadong while in Seoul. It was nice to just step out of the hotel and walk among the shops, restaurants and Tea houses. We went there few times during daytime and nighttime. One night there were street performers. The girl with keyboard singing Korean songs and speaking English had beautiful voice. Then there was a western band playing old jazz. "
No trip to Seoul complete without a visit,"A nice balance of quality merchandize, along with the obligatory tourist materials. Street food vendors were good, and not overwhelming for those new to Korean foods (and I don't mean any disrespect by that, am one myself). Not a maze of craziness like the other big market in town. Actually a pleasant way to spend a few hours looking around and absorbing some culture. A wealth of great restaurants too. If you are going to negotiate, bring cash- most merchants will work with you if you pay cash. "
Funky and interesting,"Insadong is full of unique and interesting shops. There is also plenty of restaurants to choose from. A great place to visit, to shop and to be a tourist. Use the metro as we made a mistake trying to get there by taxi. Taxi driver got lost (serious) and we lost our patience so just got off the taxi and walk using iPhone google map :)"
"Curiosities, crafts, clothes, calligraphy sets and much more.","I went twice and both times had fun. First time was on Saturday before noon and freely look around and appreciated the shops and all the amazing things you can find there. I didn't manage to finish so I decided to come back on Sunday afternoon. It was packed and the atmosphere changed completely. I took a lot of pics of what looks to me like a variety of human-ants and had fun too. But if you don't like crowds, but sure you avoid Sundays ;)"
Ideal location for visiting Seoul,"Lively area, lots of great shopping, normal tourist souvenirs along with some great unique Korean artisan gifts. Lovely restaurants tucked away down some side alleyways from main shopping area. "
"hand craft, gift, small things","A road theres a lot of korean craft, traditional craft, and gift. Not so special here. There is a building that inside sell the same thing..."
Shopping,I loved shopping in this area. Definitely don't miss the dung pancakes at the very top of the large shopping complex here! They were delicious! Although this is a very touristy area it is a fun stroll and offers some traditional Korean foods and gifts.
Great place to find gifts for friends back home!,"The handcrafted items you'll find in this market are all very cute and well-made. A bit touristy, but a great destination for shopping for souvenirs and other uniquely Korean items."
Nice to stroll,"Insadong has good restaurants and some shopping if you want to buy souvenirs. Since it is a very touristic area, prices are some what high compared to other areas in Seoul. If you feel you want to cuddle with cats you can try thr cat Caffè "
Small boutique shops,This is a nice area to shop at smaller boutique shops. It is not as crowded as other areas and there are small alleys where good restaurants reside. Worth a visit. You can also rent costumes here to walk around the palaces and take pictures. 
Nice neighborhood,"Not as big as Myeongdong yet more artistic and historic ( equally as commercialized though), Invading used to be the place where artists and officials hanged out due to its proximity to the Palace. It is a very nice walk throughout the area with great Tourist Info and free wifi- If you want some good art pieces then you can get it here but know that it will be pricey. Nice souvenir stores, local restaurants and shops, this area ( south of Anguk Metro Station and walkable to Myeondong is my favorite)."
"Arts, crafts, trinkets",The market lanes are interesting with a good range of goods as well as cafes. Some stalls have more unique items. The poo cafe was quite an experience. Also suggest the nearby music mall if you're at all musical - you will see millions of instruments and a huge range of musical equipment at this multilevel mall.
Shopping,This is the place to visit if you're looking for handmade paper or beautiful lamps. If you visit this place on Sunday the street will have no traffic and is open to pedestrians
Very artsy ! ,"Street full of arts n handcrafted stuffs. If u wish to be different, I encourage u toget your souvenirs from here rather than the typical keychains n what not the mainstream tourists always buy. Def very different shoppin atmosphere frm Myeongdong or Dongdaemun. I prefer this. And u can walk down all the way to the famous stream ! :-)"
Great Shopping and Food,"Get lost in the side streets or walk the main road, either way you will enjoy your time in Insadong. I went there the first time with a walking tour for dinner and we had some great authentic food then I found myself going back on my own when I had some free time to walk around and by gifts for my family at home. Very close to the subway which makes it very easy to visit."
Great strolling sunday morning street...,"It is a very nice touristic ( in a positive way..) place...Stroll along ( on the way form the Palace...forgot which one, the main one..) look at the small shops, tea, souvenirs it is all here....WORTH A VISIT !!!"
A nice place to spend the day,"I like the atmosphere here. Many souvenir shops (although it is not cheap), cafe that offer delicious desserts, cat cafe, alive museum, etc. This is absolutely a tourist area. I think all travellers should go to this place just to enjoy the atmosphere here."
Tourist shopping just as you thought. ,We went on a Sunday afternoon and the whole area was packed. Lots of stores selling exactly the same things. But a couple of gems if you look hard. You will never confuse this with high end shopping but it was fun for awhile. 
Great shopping,"Visited twice - most interesting small shops, found genuine Korean handmade paper and loved the Ginkgo trees and not many cars. Pedestrian friendly."
"Great food, interesting shopping ","The restaurants in the back alleyways are from another planet. They are very rarely gone to by foreginers and thus they don't really speak English, so make sure you understand a little Korean if you wander off the main street. The food is very worth going, there is also some interesting street food. As for the shopping this is where I did the majority of my tourist trap shopping. All of the shops have pretty much the same things and everything is very cheap. On my last day there it started to rain and I stopped to buy and umbrella. One of the shopkeepers tried to steal my things while I was buying an umbrella so I would have to go in the store, so just make sure you keep your head about you. The locals will try to tell you they don't have what you want so you will buy something else, if that happens just switch shops. "
"Insadong-gil Market, Seoul","Insa-dong is an area in Seoul and the main street is Insadong-gil, which is connected to a multitude of alleys that lead deeper into the district,[1] with modern galleries and tea shops. It is very interesting to browse the stores and to try the street food from local vendors."
Sweet,"Insadong gas a special place in my heart! Love it! Some of like old city feeling. Hand made stuff, good cafes and food and close to really good shopping!! "
Disappointed,"Hearing all these wonderful things about Insadong (인사동), this was one of my absolute go see things. I must say it was really disappointing to see that it wasn't as big area as it had been described as. If you're interested in more art things it wouldn't be a complete waste of time. Otherwise don't bother."
Cool neighbourhood,A pocket of 'cool' in Seoul. Lots of streets to wander and shops to keep you busy. You can pick up handmade goods and also souvenirs here.
"Loved <33 this small, intimate, artsy corner of Seoul.","This area is anything but a tourist trap! Old world custom and heritage (in the form of small thatched houses converted into artist's studios) including any crystal therapy or herb or tea that the Koreans use to tiny resturants and coffee shops. We went during a rainstorm and happily escaped into each new shop along the path, discovering layers of old and new Korean culture."
"Good for memoirs,",The long street has several types of shops and local memoirs and souvenir are very popular. You need to do a lot of bargain at many places. Some good restaurants around I went to Little India and found it to be average. 
Different experience in a different part of seoul,"Plenty of shops, cafe and restaurant. Pedestrian walk offers a good experience as you pleasantly stroll through the streets. Many tea houses and art pieces. Retail shops selling cosmetic, soveiniers and crafts "
Uniquely unique,"Of so many unique souvenirs sold here I just love the range of handmade soaps they can offer.Bought a few home and noticed not all are of world-class quality.Scents just disappear after a few usage and do not moisturize that well as advertised.Others are definitely worth a penny.One can find many other souvenirs here e.g. watches,jewelleries,home decors,gifts,interesting clothes,etc.Semi open air concept the entire shopping area so do avoid on rainy days."
Different from other Korean neighborhoods and markets,"Insadong is definitely worth a visit for travelers who are new to Korea. There are many shops, restaurants, and hotels. It is great and safe way to ""get lost"" in a Korean neighborhood by just following what interests you. Many restaurants clearly display their menu items and prices out in the street, and it's easy to drop in to a place you want. There are some must-dos, like trying some street food if you visit in the late afternoon or evening. We have tried many, and have members of our group who sometimes have sensitive stomachs and we never had any issues with any food we bought on the street. If you are looking for something sweet, on the corner by the ""mural"" there is a food at night that resembles a pancake or doughnut, that is served with a sweet caramel-like sauce and nuts that is delicious and cheap. Another must find is the dumpling (mondu) shop, it is right on the main Insadong street, and at busy times there is a guy with a sign advertising it right out in the middle of the street, as it is tucked away down a narrow side street. Again, I'm sure there are people who had a negative experience, but we always felt safe in Insadong, even traveling with our young children."
Pretty street with cute souvenirs,"Insadong is a pretty road with souvenirs shops on left and right. it was nice to have an afternoon walk here. I saw many girls using hanbok, but i didn't know where to rent :( There are a lot of cosmetic shops too like Etude, Innisfree, Nature Republic, Aritaum. Street food snacks sell cheap food like toppokki, egg bread, etc. Here you can buy a pair of socks for only 1000won, very cheap and cute :)"
Tourist spot,A must visit for visitors to Seoul. You can find many cultural items and souvenirs. There are many good restaurants which serve local cuisine. My Korean friend brought me to a restaurant which serve fermented crab - an expensive dish but I must say...its not to my liking! Kimchichiggae is ok!
Shopping without annoyance,You can find anything you want to buy as a souvenir here but without the merchants hassling you. There are also many great restaurants. Try one of the small ones on a side street
Tourist shopping street,It is what it is. You can buy high priced tourist stuff here (e.g. boxes inlaid with mother of pearl). We drank tea at the O'Sulloc store and bought some packs of green tea to take back as presents. But really you'll be better off buying your presents for folks at home from a museum gift shop or a folk village or even from the duty free stores at Incheon airport.
"Plenty to see, must go place in Seoul","Been here several times and its a place which you don't get bored. Go there early and you can easily spend a few hours there. There are plenty of shops to buy local souvenirs, from cheap to expensive, lots of variety. Highly recommeded. "
Lovely,This is by far the best part of the city. It has many small shops and you can have great meals here.
Shopping for souvenirs,A place where you can find souvenir items from Seoul. Option to have your dinner or lunch here - food is. Bit cheaper compared to Myeongdong District. 
Nice area,Visited Ssamzegil and the nearby restaurants. Place exumes a different feel and very traditional. Particularly interested in this place which u had no clue of the name of the restaurant but it is very near Ssamzegil. Insadong 14 gil.You should try this dish in the picture 
Okay but not spectacular,"We had a long layover at Incheon and decided to take the Arex into Seoul Station. Once there we asked the English information person about where we should go being we only had 3-4 hrs of time. She suggested Insadong. We didn't know any better so took her word for it, and a few stops on the subway later we were there. Insadong is easy to get to and easy to find once out of the station. We found it somewhat interesting and cheesy at the same time. There were a lot of tourist shops, but far more expensive than Myeondong or such as they seem to directly target tourist. I twas a fun and safe and somewhat hygienic stroll but lacked authentic character. They did have some interesting shops for knives and sort and we did buy a few things. The best memory was of a European guy selling ice cream on the street that was part circus act and part comedian. The ice cream was delicious (it was July) and the performance getting you the ice cream was even better. Hard to describe, but if he is there selling ice cream/gelato, buy it even if you aren't hungry for it. You will become part of the show and is definitely video worthy!"
Experience everything here.,"This area has everything for younger adults to shop, drink, eat and just hang out. There are carts and shops for everyone and even dogs. Even dogs can shop for little outfits here. Anyone up for coffee? Well you will find a Starbucks or coffee shop and a French bakery approximately every 50 km. If you are looking to get your nails done you will need to look up to the 2nd or 3rd floors of the buildings to find things/services you may need."
Expat haven,Interesting district. Lots of drinking. 10000 all you can drink in an hour. Street could be anywhere in world. Food good but not cheap. 
nice area to walk around,"This is suppose to be the traditional temple area. Right now the streets seemed to be kinda closed and very few cars drive down the road. There are some clothing shops but a lot of stalls, and restaurants. There are loads of side streets which then have real treasures in terms of restaurants etc. So its a great place to spend the evening"
"""Pretty much for the tourist""","Lots of small shops, restaurants and coffee shops. Just fun to stroll and look, even in a Seoul monsoon downpour. Enjoyed it."
One of a kind artisan jewelry pieces,Is you are interested with local artisan custom jewelry this is a good place to look for one. Price range depends on the material like brass to gold. 
Artsy area,This street (or area) is great for the little Korean souvenirs and knickknacks. The paper lamps are absolutely beautiful and they will custom make them (mix and match styles and colors) and ship them as well. There are some very nice restaurants in the area as well.
A Wonderful Place for Exploring and Eating,"Little side alleys off the main street offer a wealth of dining choices. We didn't bother with recommendations, just found a place that featured a menu that interested us, and it was fine. Shopping on the main street was fun, and in the evening strollers and musicians and theater groups added to the ambiance. "
Nice place to buy gifts for friends and family,"In the city center, a lot of stores with everything you need to buy as gifts. Reserve at least 2 hours to have time for more stores."
Perfect for an afternoon stroll,"This street is full of little shops that sell uniquely Korean items. I bought my daughter's beautiful Hanbok here. There are lots of yummy restaurants to pick from, so best time to come is during the afternoon and then have dinner before you leave."
Loved the area and had a little surprise,Had a lot of fun in the area. Nice places to sit outside and enjoy dinner or simple drinks.Dont expect a lot of women there since its a gay friendly area. We enjoyed it being straight though. Everyone was more than welcoming.
Touristy,Nice little tourist gifts to bring back to friends or family. A few interesting shops to throw into the mix which is nice though. Nice to see it if you are close :)
Pleasant for a stroll,"A well-known picturesque street for art shops, better quality souvenirs, jewelry, little cafe's, and so forth. One of the few places we saw Western tourists. There's even a Starbucks - its Korean name large, its western name small. Pleasant to siti in its front window or another one of the small cafes and watch the passing scene. We saw many young Korean ladies and some young men walking in traditional costumes. When we asked why - the answer ""Because it's fun!"""
Good for Cultural Shopping,This is a good spot to shop as a tourist. You get a better idea of the unique cultural aspect of Korea instead of the globalized world market industry you'd see at other malls and shopping areas. 
Business ,"As I had a free day I went out city site. Recommend from the hotel I went over there. I found a very young, modern places in a lot of Caffee, small bars, nice small shops, small and very pleasantly streets. Real nice to walk around. Great atmosphere. Good afternoon walking. "
Take in the sights and sounds,A good place for a casual stroll and at the same time pick up some Korean souvenirs to bring home. Check out the side alleys that branch out from the main Insadong street. You will find more interesting eateries and shops. Stop at Ssamziegil which is 4-5 storey high mall with more shops and cafes.
Lovely street,"Lovely street with lot of souvenir shops. However price usually remains the same throughout. I didn't try bargaining, as the prices were reasonable."
One of my Favorite Places,I go back here all the time. The scale of the place is more suitable for pedestrians and the main pedestrian street is great for walking and seeing. There are nice multilevel cafes and stores.
Most fun shopping area in Seoul.,This is series of long streets lined with interesting shops and eating places. It is a must for sightseeing in Seoul.You can spend several hours having fun and looking around on this street which is filled with young people.
Shopping Variety,"Most websites will tell you that Insadong is the place to go if you want traditional Korean souvenirs. While this is true they are also forgetting about the interesting things you can find at Ssamzie-gil.Ssamzie-gil can be found partway down the main shopping road in Insadong. If you love jewellery, cute earrings, red bean pancakes shaped like poop and other interesting items, this is definitely the place to go. There is also a Punky Planet store further down the street, great for those people who (like me) like big, brightly coloured earrings. During my time in Seoul, I purchased 18 pairs of earrings, most of which I purchased in Insadong.There are also a few shops selling KPop/Hallyu items on the main street which makes Insadong a one-stop-shop for all of the gifts you plan on buying for those back home (or for yourself). There are also plenty of Turkish ice cream stands, restaurants and food carts along the street as well."
Best place for Korean memories ,We loved this quaint little street. It has the essence of korea with tons of Korean tea houses lining the street. Thia is the place to go as there are many authentic shops selling souvenirs. All prices are abt the same so choose one you're most comfortable with. We loved that there're many street stalls for you to try all the different street foods. 
"Food, souvenirs and more","Insadong is everything a tourist is looking for: shopping, food, coffee/tea, a stroll, history, temples, cultural parade, etc...For shopping, it has antique shops, art, pottery, clothing, and all kinds of souvenirs to remind you of the wonders of Korea. For food, there are a number of Korean restaurants to choose from. Also, Italian and Japanese. Do not be afraid to go to small alleys. That is where you'll find the best restaurants that will cater to any kind of palates and budgets. There is no shortage of coffee shops, tea shops,ice cream shops and street food. In the afternoon, be surprised by street performances and cultural parades."
My favorite in Seoul,"Full of galleries, shops, museums, food and life! A great place to spend a day in Seoul. Full of some of the best boutiques and art galleries, I recommend taking your time while here. Try some great food. Go to the Kimchi museum!! (Really, go there, it's so fun). There's so many cool shops and art. There's a definite ambiance here. The young girls dressed in traditional Korean clothing, street vendors, entertainers, and art make for a very lovely way to spend a day. Enjoy"
What a lovely street,"We were staying at the Makers hotel not too far away from this street. We've been very impressed with the streets in Korea. Many have fascinating restaurants, cafes, and bars. On insadong you'll find traditional and slightly modern Korean cuisine. We especially liked the different porridges and street food. There's something made out of honey and nuts that's worth getting just to watch the presentation. This is such a cute area of Korea that's worth going to."
Artist central,"If you are looking to get away from the over commercialized area of Myeongdong than head to Insadong. While you'll still find some of the cheap tourist souvenirs you can find more unique, hand crafted items in Insadong. On my last night in Seoul I was wandering the area and spotted a gorgeous, hand painted sign. It was small (about 4""x 12"") and a bargain at 10,000 won. The artist himself was there to show me other similar paintings he had. It was a neat experience and added sentimental value to my purchase. "
A slice of Korea,Vibrant neighborhood with lots of shops and restaurants along the stretch of the main road and the inner alleys. The locals are friendly but most can barely speak English. The tourist information center by the entrance employs young folks who speak excellent English and can provide maps and other useful resources and information.
Food and souvenirs paradise ,"If you want authentic Korean food at moderate price you sure need to visit Insinsadong! Plus this is a good place to buy souvenirs and, even traditional costumes.For those who likes art this is a paradise full of art galleries and museums. You can call it Seoul's art centre."
Seoul Walking Street,Insa-Dong Walking Street is the way to live in Seoul.Where the ambiance createdin this seen is indicative of the Korean people contemporary culture.It is fun to walk-around there and get the feeling of the locals.
Lively weekend street,"I always make it a point to visit Insadong when I am in Seoul, especially during the weekends. I like the street for its traditional crafts and also increasingly trendy stalls. I have bought really nice handmade accessories there, and also once treated by my Korean friend to a traditional healthy cuisine in a spacious Korean style garden restaurant in one of the deep alleys. Do wonder a bit to the side alleys to view the traditional houses (most are now restaurants), take your time to look into the art galleries, or just sit around and enjoy the sights of young girls in Korean dresses strolling the street. "
An Elegant Shopping Place,"Insa-dong, which is easily approachable, is located in the heart of the city. The notable feature of the place is cleanliness and orderliness.More over it is a very lively place. The place is very famous for the old precious and traditional goods and curios. But there are artifacts of Korea for every one with a wide spectrum of affordability. There main road in Insa-dong branches with side roads, lanes and alleys on each side where there are are galleries and traditional restaurants, cafeterias etc.. There are about 100 galleries in the area which depicts traditional Korean fine art from paintings to sculptures. Examples are Hakgojae Gallery, (folk art) , Gana Art Gallery, which promotes many promising artists, and Gana Art Center. The teahouses and restaurants are very clean and hygienic and refreshing reflecting the great ambience of the galleries. The window shopping in itself in Insa-dong can be very entertaining as each shop is unique in its own way. Every Saturday during afternoons and whole Sunday, the main street becomes a cultural space with traditional performances and exhibits. A must visit place in the Seoul City."
Clean shopping area,"No smoking & littering in this area. Yes, you can search some Korean souvenirs here with comfortable feeling. Almost anything you can find in the shops here, magnets, keychains, pens, postcards, t-shirts and any other handycrafts. Price is average, some people said you may find cheaper in other places but in this area you also can explore other things like visit museums, palace, galleries, and also very close to Bukchon village. How to get here? Take subway to Anguk Station & just near the exit this it... :)"
Shop till you drop,Shopping area with stores that carry many items that the average tourist may be looking for. Also many different restaurants to try.
Charming,A must visit. Narrow cobble streets with charming shops. It is a unique place to be in the heart of the city and a true South Korean experience. Be sure to take smaller denomination notes with you so you can but trinkets for family and friends. It was difficult to get change there. 
Quaint shopping district,Beautiful and fascinating shops piled on top of each other. Lots of wonderful items to buy and great little restaurants!
The best place for tourist items!,"On my first trip to Korea way back in 2004, Itaewon was the place to be. Now Itaewon has cleaned up its act and spruced up to become the attraction for the hip younger generation of Koreans and foreigners to go clubbing and eat at fancy restaurants. Gone are the street vendors. Even most of the little hole in the wall places where the sales people would push whatever ware they were selling in front of you as you walked by saying, ""Genuine imitation, custom made just for you!!"" This was my favorite part about Korea and I was at a loss when I returned and the Itaewon I knew and loved was gone. But alas!!! Insadong has came to the rescue! No, it's not as third world country as the old Itaewon but it has all the little tourist shops that a person can desire. If you are looking for something as a memento of your time in Korea or looking for gifts for friends and family back home, this is absolutely the place to go!!! p.s. Make certain to go to Ssamjegil. 쌈지길 is what the sign will read."
Best place to shop in Korea,"While Myeong-dong and other districts / areas in Korea are good places to shop in, I absolutely loved Insadong more specifically because of the artsy items you can find. Was able to buy decors and other unique items that were different from the usual fanfare of beauty products and touristy items. Dedicate 3 - 5 hours for this!"
MUST MUST MUST SEE!!!,If you're looking for a traditional Korean shopping and eating street then you must go to the Insadong area! There's a main strip of traditional styled houses and shops selling perfect Korean souvenirs and there were quite a few traditionally styled restaurants. We went to a traditional tea house and it felt very authentic and peaceful. Lots of choices and great service at all the shops and the two restaurants we visited! Souvenir and art shops are reasonably priced and I managed to get half my gifts from the main Insadong street. Overall super super super impressed and highly recommend visiting!!!
Ssamziegil rooftop Ddong cafe,Interesting dung theme rooftop cafe in Insadong. You need to walk round the building with crafts shop before you reach. Can leave dung message on the wall and glass. Novelty. 
A little over-rated,"A busy, mostly pedestrian, shopping street. We were a little disappointed. It is mostly a touristy souvenir and local art shopping street. There are many restaurants, and I'm sure some are good. We, however, blindly picked a not so good one for dinner. We found some of the historical sites much more interesting, but, if you like souvenir shopping, Insadong is the place to go."
My favorite place in Seoul,"This is the cultural street with lots of local Korean shops, performances by the locals and tea houses. You can bargain a little in these streets. Definitely visit this place."
Absolutely a place to stroll in Seoul,"Full of interesting and moderately price shops, courteous vendors that are not shouting and/or following you, Insadong has a very interesting mix of shops and restaurants, bars, and many cafes, noteworthy Paris Croissant, to try. You can find really nice folk art, specially clothing, very elegant pieces for ladies, good craftsmanship and creative styles. A very nice place to be in Seoul, a must, lots of variety, everybody is friendly."
Experience Old Charm of Seoul,"We stayed in Insadong so had the pleasure of crossing this street every day during our visit. Its got an old charm feel about it which is delightful. Some nice little cafes line the street and the shops sell beautiful trinkets including jewelry, art work, and souvenirs. A must for visitors to Seoul!!"
To me the best shopping street in Seoul,Myeongdong is great for regular products (especially socks) and the lively vibe but to me Insadong is the best shopping street in Seoul. Go here for all your touristy souvenirs and visit the old lady with an open shop on the corner selling ceramics at a very good price.
Insadong street shopping,"This is a great shopping area. You will find some great little treasures and gifts to take home.....some great pottery,little tea sets, beautiful fans and ofcourse tshirts. It is more antique styles."
The Insadong shopping district,The Insadong shopping and dining district features a variety of shopping opportunities for those looking for souvenirs. It's approximately a mile long with many side streets and hundreds of shops. A great number of restaurants are located on the second and third story of many of the buildings. We ended up buying artwork with the names of our great nephews and niece written in Korean. Lots of items from trinkets to attractive artwork are available. Plenty of street vendors selling food.
Art and Antique market,"Well worth a visit. The Insa-dong in Seoul is art and antique market having dozens of art galleries and shops selling art supplies, antiques, and handicrafts along one main street and many side alleys. It also has many traditional tea and coffee shops.Only thing that be careful of is traffic. Would be improved by making the street pedestrians only.Also try Korean Tradition Drink made of pumpkin.. its served cold."
Fun shopping and browsing,Great fun to wander the shops - everything from less expensive touristy stuff to finer quality clothing and artwork/craftwork. Loads of fun and lots of places to try new Korean foods. Very busy and friendly atmosphere all around.
interesting place with great local restaurant,nice area to chill with good restaurant and many street food. go and get lost there as u can find hidng gems inside this area.
"Fun place to visit, have some tea!",I had some time between meetings so my colleague took me here for a couple hours. Was really nice to walk around looking in shops and enjoying the old style buildings and lively atmosphere. We foudn a great little tea shop and enjoyed some Ginseng tea!
Cute shopping are,Cute little neighborhood for strolling and people watching. Lots of cute shops. Many shops selling calligraphy brush and ink sticks. There's a cat cafe too. Lots of street food vendors .
Lively shopping area,Insadong is 1 of the famous shopping areas in Seoul full of mouth watering street food and shopping variety - colorful and is full of lights at night
An Art Street of Seoul,The place is very close to Gyong Palace and is worth exploring. Lots of shops selling souvenirs.Don't buy goods at the asked prices as they bargain a lot.
"Nice quaint shops, art stores and souvenirs",Love this place. Korean artistry is showcased here ... both modern and traditional. Nice shops that you can easily spend half a day here. 
you can find everything,"Traditional dress,gift,hanbok,cosmetics, you can find every thing this colorful Street.Turkish ice creams boy are very funy and they have good icecream"
Streets selling souvenirs,There are many locals (or tourists?) wearing traditional korean costumes walking along the streets. A good place to explore if you are looking for korean souvenirs. 
Top place for arty souvenirs!,I was lucky to come with a Korean friend who showed me the coolest parts of insadong and I came away with a nice present for my family. It's a great blend of old tradition mixed with creative young Korean minds. A must see in Seoul. 
Insadong,"Neat shopping area typical of Seoul. Super stores, restaurants, bars, etc. Shows the true life of everyday Seoul people. Met some interesting persons.."
Very hit or miss,"There are some cool areas of Insadong where locals set up shop to sell their hand-made goods and local musicans busk; however, most of the area though is covered in those shops that sell mass-produced products made from China where every shop decides to sell the exact same items. I would not recommend eating in the area unless you read a good review about it as well as some shops are tourist pricing type shops.I would say Insadong area is where many of the older generation locals live. You'll notice that quite early in walking around in the area outside of the main strip.If you are planning to go to Gyeongbokgung palace or Changdeokgung palace they you owe yourself to check the area out as it is extremely close."
NExt to our hotel - so we enjoyed everyday,This is still quite local in many ways and full of local Korean eateries - busy and bustling its shops favor more modern now but some of the side streets still have older stores - not to be missed.
Good for souvenirs and people watching,"Located near Gyenonbokchung palace and the US embassy. This seems like a central location in Seoul. The market has many souvenir stores for tourists and there seemed to be many english friendly restaurants. It is 20 minute walk from Seoul Train Station if you want to do that. Also, from here one can walk to all other major Seoul attractions. The market is a stop on the Seoul Tour Bus. I was there on a Saturday evening and the place was busy and bustling. "
Horrible cheap souvenir and T-shirt shops with a couple of good stores in the mix.,"Don't waste your time here if you are shopping for quality goods. There may be a couple of good stores, but finding them among the morass of cheap shops is a battle. I wouldn't trust buying anything here, as likely much of it could be made in China. No good restaurants that we saw, just more of the same junky shops block after block. Not worth the cab ride to get there."
Full of foods everywhere!,Insadong is a nice small town full with boutique hotels and food outlet. There are many alleys with small family run restaurant. People there are nice and friendly. Subway station are well connected to other major cities in Seoul. Would recommend you to stay here and travel around in Seoul for backpackers or family holiday.
Favorite part of Seoul so far... ,"I had heard that Insadong was a great place for traditional Korean Culture. It did not disappoint. The local vendors, the food on the street, and the many, many restaurants. This was such a special place. Some of the stores were a bit pricey, but you can find some great local keepsakes here. Very easy to find. Just take the main road Insadong Gil then start looking down all the different allies. "
Another shopping street - spend very little time there,"A very busy shopping street with nothing to buy. Traditional Korean handcrafts are expensive here, better go to Dongdaimung area. Some restaurants are the same chain in Myeongdong, but prices are higher in Insadong."
Standard tourist trap with some tasty food options,"This semi-pedestrianized road has all the hallmarks of a typical commercial tourist area: tour buses crowded near the entrance, mass-produced souvenir shops, retail handicrafts, tea houses, and bland commercial art galleries. Insa-dong's saving grace is a charming mix of Joseon period, independence-era and modern architecture. Some of the nearby restaurants and food stalls are worth recommending, like Bukchon Son Mandu."
Souvenir shop,"If you are looking for souvenir shop Insadong it;s the best place to visit, t-shirt, mask, magnet, key chain, chopstick, with good price, you can bargain in some shop. good place to walk"
Very Average Shopping Street,"Contrary to the numerous positive reviews here, Insadong was not very exciting for me. It is merely a couple of streets lined with souvenir stalls and art galleries/ antique shops. Not very unlike the rest of the rest of the markets in Korea, except that this place is a lot smaller and less exciting. The caricature shops charge exorbitant prices as compared to places like Myeongdong and Hongdae. The cafes are also significantly less vibrant and colorful than the abundance of coffee places in Seoul. Maybe I'm just not an artistic person but I failed to be charmed by this little street. A place I think I would skip if I have limited time in Seoul."
Expat capital of Seoul,Insadong was a very busy area that had a lot of expats roaming around. There are a ton of restaurants that serve a wide variety of foods if you're tired of just eating Korean food and the bar/club scene was pretty bustling. Our group had a great time hanging out here.
Fun place ,"Insadong street nice place for many shop mix between clothes,accessories, artists, foods and else's  It's very good place to take around in this area "
Enjoyment!,"Spent a couple of hours wandering up and down the lanes - some shopping lanes, some tea houses, some food lanes. It gave me a real feel for the old part of the city of 24 million people."
Great place for expat sightings,"Went for the shopping, but learned that this area is known for having a lot of expats. We shopped, ate and then participated in the pub crawl that night. Go afternoon and stay till late"
Interesting area,Lots of souvenir shops and restaurants in a touristy area of Seoul. Antique shops are also around but not too sure how genuine their wares are.
Pleasnt walk,"Close to my Hotel ""New Kukje"" , I found this a very easy place to navigate to with my local map and it had a good mixture of shops, both cheaper and upmarket and eateries. ."
Artistic,"Many traditional Korean souvenir shops, tea / dessert houses, gallery and a soju museum (Sool gallery) in the area. A nice place to visit."
nice Artcraft market from Seoul.,"there is a main Street where all shops are concentrated, mostly korean artcraft and accesories. nice combo with Cheonggyecheon walk "
Intersting neighboorhood,"Colorful, crowded, lots of street food , souvenir shops and restaurants. However, streets are littered with trash and cigarette butts. people spitting's... which reduces the quality of a tourist spot. I stayed thru a weekend and after a Saturday night, the streets are full of trash , leftover food from people eating on the sidewalk, they set up little tables and chairs on the sidewalks for eating and drinking at night.A single worker trying to sweep the street in the morning, I feel so sorry for him with that tough jobFood is dumped in storm drain creating a foul smell in some spots"
Something for everyone,"Insadong - is easy to find by subway and has lots of different activities. So there are art galleries to browse for art lovers; traditional tea houses to experience some Korean teas, lots of shopping - either for traditional items - pottery, hanbok (traditional clothing), hanja (paper) - or for souvenirs of the normal sort - lots of shops. And many restaurants to have lunch/dinner. The Joygesa buddhist temple is nearby - and there are restaurants that feature traditional buddhist food - that is a real experience (Sanchon is one of those - and there is another in the administration building across from the temple) There are also abundant street food vendors to sample and be sure to watch the guys making dragon's beard candy - it is amazing! The southern end of the street has a small park that is significant in historical terms."
Handicrafts and novelty gifts shopping,The street is filled with many stores having handmade souvenirs. These are unique wood crafts and jewelry. It's a good shopping street for some of the unique gifts for your friends..
Insadong is still the place to hang out.,"Insadong has something for everyone...for the tourist and for the locals and long time visitors...I go there on every trip and still find wonderful things, like the 'charcoal' store which sells everything made with charcoal...from blankets to toothpaste! The authentic restaurants and tea houses and art galleries are also pleasurable experiences. Of course, there are the stores which sell souvenirs...but make sure your purchase is Made in Korea and not Made in China..."
Tourist spot,"Went there during the day in April. There were nice Korean souvenirs that could be purchased however I noticed the same items in other locations for cheaper prices. It also seemed like a shopping paradise for mostly tourists and even some of the shops were managed by tourists. There were restaurants and I heard you could dress in the traditional ""Hanbok"" at a place there. I didn't have the time but would have loved to do that! They let you walk around the streets in it so it would be a great photo opportunity!"
The place for expats,This is probably the Korean equivalent of lan Kwai Fong with watering holes lining the whole street. Everyone here speaks English and finally u can find some decent non-Korean food
Great shopping,A good area for shopping traditional Korean items. We managed to get some beautiful hand-paintings and gift items for friends and actually visited the area twice. One can also pick the airport shuttle from this area which is way cheaper than a taxi. 
Stylish & somehwat understated suburb,"This is my first visit to Seoul and I'm glad to visit Insadong, which is full of craft and boutique stores as well as cafes. The best part is I came on a Saturday but there weren't huge crowds - like some other attractions in the city!"
Tons of restaurants ,Insadong has a bunch of restaurants and stores. The area was really cool. Lots of different stores. The area really lit up at night. 
Traditional Shopping,"We visited Insadong twice, once in the morning and another in the evening. I would suggest to visit the place in the evening as there are more shops open. From my observation, most shops in Seoul open late. It's a more relaxed shopping area with less people compared to Myeongdong or Namdaemun. You'll see more tradional shops in Insadong. They sell traditional food and fashion. Comparing the price here and other shopping areas, items here are more expensive. Nonetheless, it was a good experience."
Good place for Westerners.,"If you don't speak Korea this is good place to do your shopping and eating. If you are looking for designer copies you can get them all in one place, just ask. They are more expensive than in China but if you are in need you are in luck. You can also negotiate the price, the avarge discount if you pay cash is 10%."
Vibrant,"Lots of walking so it's good to stop at the Information centre to get a map and ask for recommended routes to use. Along the way, there are private mesuems, art gallery, cafes, restaurants etc to visit. You could spend a day walking around."
Hm only for tourists...,"If you in seoul only for a few days or want to get some presents quickly, you are right there. But if you want to get a glimpse of original seoul atmosphere, better go someplace else. I felt almost like it was some kind of tourist trap..."
Just ok!!!,I was not particularly impressed from Insa-Dong. Just nice to walk around as the main road is in the shadow of nice trees.
Nice Atmosphere!,"Went there around 7pm, walked the long stretch of road, soaked in the atmosphere... nice, less crowded, street lined with shop selling traditional handmade paper, arts, baskers (playing western music!!!) and traditional korean restaurant. Lovely!"
Good place for shopping,This is a good place to buy souvenirs - 50% less than the souvenirs would cost inside Incheon Intl Airport. Other stuffs are also expensive but must try this one store that sell fluff dessert (i forgot what it's called) it's probably how cotton should feel like. 
Must-do,I had heard a lot about the old teahouses and this is the street to find all of them. The street is right off Anguk Station so very easy to reach also
Fun and scenic stroll with shops,"The tree lined Main Insadong Street is filled with traditional tea houses, yaki mandu dumplings street food, a Hanbok cafe photo studio ($25+), art shops, souvenirs, cane cone soft serve ice cream, a little toy store, an ancient pagoda in the tappol park, a Fart cafe with poo cakes ( my boys thought it was fun, behind Insa Art plaza), a 3 story craft bazzar and cafe, and a trick eye alive museum for the kid in all of us. I was able to get my kids to let me shop with the promise of ice cream, so everyone was happy. Anguk station exit 6, turn left at info center in 200 ft. Or Jongno 3-ga station exit 1. Walk 2-3 blocks. Turn right then left.accross from tappol park. There alleys with more shops and Chinese antiques off the main road. But you can spend as little as 1-2 hours here and still see a lot. My husband hates to shop, so I have to be quick. "
Cultural Find,"This neighborhood is worth walking around. Lots of local ceramic & art shops, trendy coffee & tea shops. "
Shopping!,"Lots of local, traditional products available to purchase. If you're looking for Korean souvenirs to bring home, this is the place to go. Don't forget to check out the little alley ways too. There are alot of great, very affordable places to eat."
Good shopping,Visited as part of tour and learned a lot of history of the area. Also bought some really pretty rice paper paintings. 
A lovely place for souvenirs ,"A really busy popular place for traditional souvenirs. Many shops and foods however reality is, it's more 4 shops copied and pasted 100 times and some interesting craft or independent alternative art shops. You can really just walk into any shop get what you need and the price would be the same or very close in the other 100 down the road. If you have time, then browse around and think about things, as you pick up almost identical items in each store only to question if it's really a good souvenir if it's mass produced in such a way. But as far as atmosphere goes, it's a nice walk around and good place to get those gifts for family members before you leave korea.P.S. Many people say it's overpriced but you will find the same things at the airport duty free shops leaving Korea for double the price. "
Insadong Shopping,"This is a great little district in which to pick up some local Korean gifts. The closest subway station is Anguk and the best exit was #6. Come out from the station steps and walk straight forward until you see on the left a street with lots of activity-that's Insadong. There's something for everyone, food to keep you going and interesting stores from Korean souvenirs, to clothing shops to cute artisanal jewelry and handcraft shops. Some stores will offer a discount for cash and some will even do it for credit cards, if you're buying multiple items. But mostly, the price is the price. For me, it was a great shopping area for some nice memories of the trip and upcoming Christmas gifts for the family. You can spend an hour or 3 here..."
You can find almost anything,"This place offer you a lot of thing like food, traditional food, fast food, traditional item, painting, cloth, arts, souvenir, convenient store, cosmetics, street food, street show, and ect. Love this place so much. You can find weird thing at this place. The must visit place when you in seoul korea."
Definitely my favourite place to shop at in Seoul,"My interests lie more in the cultural/historical side, so this was a really wonderful place to visit. I wish I had set aside more shopping money for Insadong. The handicrafts and souvenirs are beautiful and unique, though a little on the pricy side. It would be good to compare prices because some stores sell the same type of souvenirs at different prices. The traditional teahouses mostly open at 11am, do take note if you're going in the morning. Definitely recommended to try it out, the cultural experience and gastronomical delight is worth the price."
Spellbound! ,"If you love culture, architecture, art, and history, this place is highly recommended. It's easy to imagine oneself transported to the past while walking along the streets lined with the well preserved old houses. Drop by Ahn's art studio! We purchased a cat painting and he made free sketches of our daughters. He's quite a fun and interesting character! "
Interesting place,"Another tourist attraction. Lots of local designer wares and art design pieces can be found here. You can also visit Ssamzeigeil where it's a 4(?) stories open-air mall with interesting layout and shops. If you get tired from walking, duck into any of the many coffee houses there to rest, have a nice cool drink and simply people watch. "
Great for souvenir shipping and eating,"Insa-dong has tons on unique souvenir shops that you won't find in other areas. Shops focus on a lot of traditional Korean cultural items and some with a modern twist to it. If you're tired, you can take a break at one of many tea shops here. They are excellent and tranquil which will be a good break from the hustle and bustle on the main street. As for food, you can find many restaurants that specialize in traditional Korean meal sets. I would highly recommend stopping by this street. "
Good place for souvenirs,"it's a really good place for souvenirs and local stuff, I bought good stuff from there, you will also find a lot of skin care brands a long the way."
Souvenir Shopping,"You can find plenty of artsy type of souvenirs here such as tea cups, hanbok bookmarks, brushes, magnets, pencil cases. As for me I bought a musical box with arirang song playing. Cute! However, I do think that they should make this a car-free street all the time, it was stressful to navigate to cross the street while shopping. Has an artsy-hip feel to it, also check out the Ssamzigil space where you can swirl your way up the building and have a photobox picture of you taken with a hanbok. Cute!"
Awesome area!,"There are so many cool shops & restaurants in Insadong! I went back there like 3 different times! I would recommend going there for shopping, street food & people watching!"
Put on your visiting list...,the place u must go....tradition food and so many cute stuff. ชอบมากค่ะ ตอนแรกคิดว่าไม่มีอะไร แต่พอไปถึงแล้ว ชอบเลย ทั้งร้านอาหาร จะมีร้านเกี๊ยวซ่า ที่ ซัมซีกิล อร่อยมาก เรียกว่าใครก็ไปร้านนี้ มีรีวิวในทุกหนักสือท่องเที่ยวเกาหลี เป็นมื้อที่ประทับใจ และได้มีโอกาศต้องแวะไปทานขนมและชาเชียว รวมทั้งซื้อ Osulloc ด้วยนะจ๊ะ
Handcrafts and souvenirs,"It's a super artsy place with both traditional and modern arts. There are lots of handcrafted item as well, thou pricing could be a little pricey. There's lots of small food push carts so you don't have to worry about getting hungry. It's near bukchon and Samcheongdong, so you could spend 1 whole day walking around, experiencing the traditional and modern Korea."
Gift shop market and shopping street,"When you are looking for quality gifts to take home this is a good choice. A long street with nice shops, including eateries you n ed to go to. You surely find some nice presents here!"
Suberb,At first I thought Insadong will be similar to Myengdong or Hongdae (in terms of the store and crowd) but boy i was wrong. Insadong has its own uniqueness as many local artist showcase their work (from fashion to art piece). So it blend well between big brand and loval store. Was such nice experience coming here. I recommend tourist to come here
Like the Camden of Seoul,"People that have been to London may see the similarity as we did. Its a nice area of the city and had a real feeling of being the ""hip"" place to be. Worth taking a walk through on a sunny afternoon."
Handmade crafts that speak of Seoul's soul,"Other stuff which are not mostly found in Myeongdong or other near university shops can be found here. What I loved are the calligraphy brushes, handmade cases, fans, etc. If you really want something authentic and handmade, then you should go here! :)"
Souvenir Heaven,"Stamp with your name on it? Custom music boxes playing Arirang or the latest K-Pop song? Traditional knotted keychains? Crockery? Cute stationery?... You name it Insadong has it. If you feel like you've not gotten enough souvenirs, then this is the place to be. I feel like I bought every awesome souvenir from here, especially from Ssamziekil. "
Must do in Seoul ,"Many fun handmade stores(some stores offer handmade experience), many good restaurants and traditional tea shops. This is a also a good place to get souvenirs. "
Great restaurants and souvenir shops!,"On weekends and holidays, this place is jam packed with people and street vendors, but this place is still worth making a trip to. If you want to get a souvenir, this place is THE perfect place. There are so many Korean restaurants on side streets and most of the restaurants were built to look like a Korean traditional building.Many restaurants offer course meals for 25,000 won to 50,000, and they are delicious and beautifully prepared. You should also try one of the tea houses that serve traditional Korean desserts. "
Must go here when in Seoul,"The only place where all business signboards written in hangul. From here can walk to bukhon hanok village and gyeongbokgung palace. experience korean dessert and tea. Dont forget to go Osulloc, try green tea from jeju and buy their green tea milk spread. For muslim traveller, try a sujebi and korean seafood pancake at one of the restaurant in the alley. Get gifts like fridge magnet, i love korea / seoul tshirt, korean chopstick, spoon, bowl and cups, bookmark, handfan etc.. oh.. you can also rent a hanbok. "
Shopping,Best place to shop for souvenirs & food. Easy to walk about without getting lost. Make your way to ssamzegil for the open air shopping mall. One of my most favourite sites in Seoul
"When it rains, it wasn't fun","When we went to Insadong, it was raining heavily and chilly. It is a long street with lots of shops. There are a lot of shops selling souvenirs. Not much differentiation in offerings though. But there is however a building there which houses a lot of shops selling interesting items.There are also a lot of restaurants along the street. Guess if had not rained, we would have ne enjoyed the visit more. "
Amazing area of Seoul!,If you're looking for a place that has tons of amazing food and culture this is the place to be. This area has tons of great street food and a bunch of outdoor area to eat Korean barbecue. If you're looking for local prices and to be among the locals then this is the spot!
Lots of great shops!!,"Clean and inviting little shops, mostly souvenirs. Nice coffee shops everywhere. Good place to buy Korean art. Not too many street vendors. Most of the shops close at 8.30p but a great area if you are looking to buy gifts."
Buy your souvenirs here!,"I found this street by accident next to my hotel. I had already bought souvenirs in the Palace shops and I regretted dearly as things here are much cheaper. Also this is one of fev places where you will see other Europeans/Americans. Restaurants are expensive though, as every that has English name). Close to the Buddhist Temple"
Quaint neighbourhood,"We found Insa-dong to be the best place to buy traditional Korean art and other souvenirs. It is filled with antique shops, art galleries, traditional stationery shops, unique pottery and porcelain shops. Insa-dong also had many traditional restaurants, temples and teahouses."
Magical place,"I just know I hadn't enough time to spend here. Streets are so nice, with very great and warming coffee places. As a shopper, I have to say the options are just too many, it was great!"
Artsy Insadong,"Insadong is a must go place for any art lovers. The buildings there are really beautiful and there are buskers along the the street as you go. And many handmade crafts are being sold, as well as art galleries for people to view their exhibitions."
traditional + delightful,"Insadong provides visitors with an authentic experience through a bustling array of street food carts, bars and restaurants up alleyways, galleries, palaces, market-style shopping options.. the area is easy to navigate, offers a big peek at Korean culture and is definitely a neighbourhood to visit if you want a taste of tradition that's tourist friendly."
Neat,A neat (mostly) pedestrian street with lots of artisan and nic-nac shops lining the roads. A good place to get some traditional Korean food and even a place to get minimalist buddhist inspired meals. Down side is that there are so many people because it is a tourist hotspot. You just have to be a part of the crowd unfortunately. Go with the flow.
Touristy but quaint ,Busy on weekends and holidays but great for a mooch and purchasing Korean gifts to take home. Try to wander around the side streets as they are quieter and full of interesting little shops.
Artisan paradise,"If you are looking for Korean made products from inlaid wood to silk, this is the place for you. We LOVED it! The prices are reasonable and the options plentiful. "
Fascinating must see!,This delightful little street is packed with all sorts of treasures from hand crafted Korean goods to yummy food and great traditional Korean soveniers. Don't miss the Court Candy makers who mesmerise you with their skills in making thousands of strands of honey candy into scrumptious little court cakes. Highly recommend a visit.
Great Lower Key Marketplace,Insadong is a lot of fun. is less intimidating then Dongdaemun or Namdaemun but still a lot to do and see.
Lots of souvenir shops,Pleasant section of Seoul with old buildings kept intact. Full of all types of shops and cafes. One of the few places where I actually found postcards. Also there is a Cat cafe there.
great for souvenir shopping,This area was near our hotel and we enjoyed a couple of hours souvenir shopping here. There are stalls in the street in the evenings. Everything opens around 10.00 am and closes up around 10 pm
Like it,"You can find any souvenirs and any korea l made product and art product too, the price here more cheaper than any souvenir shop at myeongdong or dongdaemun"
Experience the old Korean taste bud at Insadong,Seoul did a nice job of saving old Korean buildings and turned them into a restaurants and art galleries. It is a must visit place for all foreigners visiting Korea. 
Most Fav place,I love this place many shop nice.to seebit the prize is not to cheap need skill ti analyze the prize here hahaha for the bag is cheap dont doubt it
just a walk,"not particularly attractive, nor special merchandise. a short visit is enough. many shops selling goods for tourists."
"Cute shops, cafes, restaurants and lots of souvenirs. Check out the Kimchi Museum!","The alleys are adorable and there are cute places to eat, drink, and shop. All souvenir wishes will be fulfilled here. Be sure to check out the kimchi museum -- it's a bit hard to find, and be sure to try the samples in the small fridge, they are also hard to find."
Tourist delight,Enjoyed a stroll here - lots of souvenirs to pick up and sights to take in. Had authentic tea in a tea room & street vendor foods. There are hand crafted items and Korean made souvenirs - well worth the visit.
"restaurants,shops",It's a central area with many restaurants and shops selling just about anything. It's the perfect place if you have some spare time.
A good stroll,"You can spend half the day walking here. There are plenty of eateries and shops selling handicrafts and souvenirs. It's a better area to find interesting restaurants, tea houses and souvenirs compared to the Myeongdong shopping street. There's a tourist information counter there if you need help. Get a map from the nice officer and start exploring. "
"Worth checking out, even for non-shoppers","Definitely one of the nicest parts of the city. The streets are at a more human scale and the small shops appear to be offering more original handcrafted products. Also, you'll find some pretty good food options in the surrounding area to enjoy!"
Souvenir street,"This is the best place to get souvenirs, plenty of choices available. Remember to go into the small alleys for lots of food and drink choices. Shop names there like Starbucks and Etude House are all in hangul so keep a lookout. Visit the Insadong Tourist Information Center to try on the hanbok for free."
"Dont know the fuzz, is nice street with a few...","... very good retailers and a few art galleries. I am not sure who is buying arts there, but maybe it works. Its busy and compares with any other high street in a big city, but dont see much that differentiates the street or makes it very special"
Fun place to shop for souvenirs!!!,"This was near our hotel and we went repeatedly. Lots of choices, reasonable prices. Most items were ""Made in Korea"" (not other places)."
Shop....Shop....Shop!!!!,This is one of their oldest shopping districts. Loved it! There are lots of Korean keepsakes to be bought. One of the cheapest places we shopped the entire week we visited.
Best shopping,"We went to Myeongdung first, but I enjoyed the prices and the culture in Insadong much more. If you want tourist trinkets to bring home to loved ones, this is the area to visit!"
Streets of souvenir and crafts shop,"This is one of the listed must visit place when in Seoul. Basically, is a street filled with plenty of Korean souvenir shops, arty crafts and nice tea houses. Is a nice place to roam around visiting a tea house that serve authentic Korean tea snack. "
street food & restaurant,"have their street food, and shop a little. find those red tents and eat at those places. we had fried chicken & beer there, and chilling with friends. "
Touristy street,"...with lots of artwork, souvenir shops, food stalls, galleries, tea shops. Certainly a nice place to shop (though not the cheapest) and get an idea of what Korea has to offer."
"Insadong, multitude of shopping alleys","Insa-dong is a dong, or neighborhood of the Jongno-gu district of Seoul. The main street is Insadong-gil, which is connected to a multitude of alleys that lead deeper into the district. There are many modern galleries and tea shops.Insadong-gil is ""well known as a traditional street that represents the ""culture of the past and the present. There are mixture of historical and modern atmosphere and is a ""unique area of Seoul that truly represents the cultural history of the nation.""The area has 40 percent of the nation's antique shops and art galleries as well as 90 percent of the traditional stationery shops. Make sure you visited Tongmungwan, the oldest bookstore in Seoul, and Kyung-in Art Gallery, the oldest tea house."
A different view of bustling Seoul - more arty and crafts,"This trip, I had one morning and part of an afternoon free and decided to stroll into Insadong. The last time I went for a delicious dinner at a very busy bbq restaurant. The atmosphere was busy but so like local Seoul. This time I was not disappointed. There were so many things to see, handpainted fans, paintings by locals, craft works and of course shopping. The opening price is much cheaper than Myeongdong, so there is almost no need to bargain but they will give you some discount if you insist. We came across a lovely beef broth noodle soup place - mainly locals, they did not speak English and that's where I am headed when I go back again. Time flew by too fast and I would recommend at least 4-5 hours if you include lunch and tea in the many quaint shops. You need to stop and stay still and feel the pulse of Insadong. (If you're in a hurry, all you will see are shops and more shops)."
Fascinating agglomeration of Korean crafts and antiques shops,"If you are looking for Korean craft goods or antiques, Insadong is your place. It's pretty short actually but don't miss out on the little side alleys which hold a few hidden gems including shops and restaurants. Avoid the shops at either end of Insadong as they are rather touristy."
Store this on your to-do list,"Lots of fun stores: tourist items, jewelry, clothes, massages, restaurants, Korean musical instruments.It is closed to traffic to make it easier to enjoy the many items on sale.Leave an afternoon to see all that is available. It is crowded, which adds a lot to the atmosphere."
So good,It's good to walk and good for sightseeing. There are had too many cute things and creative. And too many delicious foods on that street.
Wonderful place to find souvenirs,"This Antique Ally is filled with shops selling all sorts of traditional crafts, decorations and souvenirs. The side streets also have stores, so make sure to go down a few. The shop keepers are willing to negotiate if you buy multiple items and you'll get a better deal if you pay in cash. "
Great place for walk-shop-eat!,"Another must-go place for cultures, nibbling food and bingsu! Take a slow walk along the stretch with your friends/family, enjoy the people, shops which sells interesting things. Have an afternoon break with coffee, waffles and bingsu!✌"
Great atmosphere and historical buildings,"The main street has many lively stores, and street food stalls, but the side streets have the older buildings and the restaurants where the locals go. There is a lovely atmosphere, and it is definitely worth going, Also a short walk away from Bukchon so both can be done in one go. "
Crowded and lost its charm,"Used to be authentic and nostalgic filled. Sadly, commercialisation has hit I saying and the cultural aspect has been modernised. Good restaurants gone. Don't put it at the top of your must visit places. Only go if time permits. "
Lively busy streets of shops and cafe,This section of Seoul has so many small shops and café. We met my husband's classmate for coffee at an old Korean house turned into a coffee house. Then wandered through the streets stopping anywhere that caught our eye. Then a dinner of noodles and ban-chan to end the experience.
"Must visit - lots to see, do and eat!","Everytime we're in Seoul, Insadong street is on our list. There are so many quaint shops which sell delicious food and cute knickknacks. Our favourite stop is the O'sulloc tea house which has a wonderful selection of the best tea. If you wander off the main street, you'll find many small restaurants ranging from the typical korean fare of dumplings (mandu) and noodles, to the full Korean spread called hanjeongsik. Don't forget to also stop by the tea houses for a rest after shopping all day!"
Galleries & a view of the old days,"It is an artsy street with many galleries (although in my memory there were more when I visited it long ago). A place to find old stuff like traditional artefacts and souvenirs. There were some old tea houses hidden in the tiny alleys for a break fr the noise of tourists thronging through the place. Across the road on the side nearest to Anguk Station, you can continue your walk looking at the old buildings with many cafes. During the weekends, young pple set up their booths to sell their crafts. "
"All about art, culture and korea","Really wonderful place, but really crowded during weekend. We can find lot of unique and cute goods in here. And also don't forget to take your time to enjoy cup of tea at the traditional tea house."
Nice Spring stroll,it's a nice street to stroll on a spring day but it's too tourist-y for me. the prices for the souvenirs are a bit expensive. The art stuffs are interesting. 
Amazing !! Seoul culture ,"If you visit Seoul without visiting Insadong... You are missing out !! Highly recommended for those who appreciate foreign cultures. I must say, after this trip, I am actually planning to go visit Seoul again next year and plan to stay at Insadong. Souvenir, tea house, restaurant, fashion shopping.... You name it, you have it. Walking thru the street in Spring is just ..... I am speechless. No word to describe how happy am I. "
Fun for an evening,"Insadong is a fun street of souvenir shops and galleries, with plenty of nice restaurants and lots of great people watching. Whether you are in to fine dining or fried chicken and beer, you will find it here. Get there by 7 because some of the shops close earlier than you might expect. The dining goes on even after shops start to close."
Nice quaint quarter,"A nice place to visit and do some shopping - you can find lots of things to buy here, from souvenirs to food. Ssamziegil is spirally laid out building where you can walk all the way to the top on a spiral incline (not sure if you get my description haha). You get to see a nice view of Insadong from the top. "
Worth a visit,"Much more traditional than the boutique shops of myeongdong, with lots of interesting stalls and shops in every corner. It gives you a great feel for how locals live and shop, plus you can get some good bargains. They don't really do 'bartering' but may give you a small discount if you by more than one thing from a stall. Very enjoyable."
The Arts Street,"A place where all the artistic people gather and showcase their art pieces or talents. If you are an art lover, you will definitely love this place as there are many art galleries around."
Sweet and cute old town ,"If you love walking around, have some nice pictures, cute little gifts and teatime with close friends then Insang dong's for you. "
Interesting,"If you are looking for something artistic or planning on buying souvenirs, this is the place to go. There are plenty of galleries, tea shops and souvenirs shops. You can buy hanbok, hanji, and many more traditional stuff that you can't get elsewhere. A must go place if you love art, history, culture, and to have some time to immense yourself in this beautiful historical alley...."
Hustle and bustle with stunning background views and much tradition,"If you go to Seoul, you must go to Insadong. Insadong is packed with traditional arts and crafts and handmade goodies for sale. It also offers a wide variety of street food and great eateries. You can hear and see many traditional forms of emtertainment and also walk into a modern day mall. This is all through buzzing streets that have buildings with beautful heritage and architecture. Then you look up and the sheer face of the mountains are but streets away. Fun, delicious and breath taking all at once. Of course you can drink with your food too and you are just a strill away from one of the famous palaces and many great museums. OUTSTANDING area to visit. Get there by subway, bus or taxi. All cheap."
Typical Korean Street,"Lined with small cozy food joints, this is the best place to find typical Korean food with just the right price. Restaurant here are rated by letters. We ate at a triple A resto where the food is great and the serving is just right. Don't ask for the name of the resto as it is writen in Korean, please see the pistures for reference. "
Getting worse...,"I recently visited Insadong and it has definitely become worse. The traditional crafts stores are being replaced by popular Korean makeup brands and Korean coffee shops, that quite honestly, it does not look that different from Myeongdong. Seoul lacks separate identities for its various neighborhoods, making it impossible to guess where you are if you are given a picture of an intersection with all of the same chain stores scattered throughout town. The unique identity that I hoped Insadong would at least retain is unfortunately gone. I would recommend the area around Hongik University as a place that maintains independent stores, restaurants, coffeeshops, and a vibe."
very touristic,"Insadong is fun to go to with friends , but just for a very short while. There is nothing much to see , some coffee shops , tourist trap like many other mentioned , overpriced clothes , cheap/fake souvenirs. But still it has its charm to me. There are also if I remember correctly 2 vegetarian restaurants. And one of the best healthy and vegetarian bibimbap."
A Must Go When in Seoul,"A great area for food, photos, and local handicraft. This is a must go if it's your first time in Seoul."
Charming view of Seoul,"Certainly a nice place to stop, shop, browse and eat in Seoul. Has a great ambience, with lots of touristy shops but some interesting boutique offerings as well. The lane ways are fascinating. The food on offer needs more description than I can give here. Worth a visit when in Seoul."
Don't waste your time!,"I really wish this area was more charming and had more character.. Sadly it's now a pure tourist trap. Please take a short walk up north of Insadong to Samcheongdong where smaller boutiques, back alleys, and art galleries are. Samcheongdong is also getting more mainstream/big stores but it's still better than Insadong..."
Nice for souvenir shopping and eateries,Just took a stroll on the Insa Dong street and thoroughly enjoyed shop hopping. Nice place for well priced local souvenirs. Also has some fantastic restaurants. Very close to Anguk Metro station. A good place to start feeling The city through street shopping!
Lots of Korean Handicrafts,"This is a great place to visit if you're looking for handmade Korean crafts. There are some of the usual lower end market shops but there are also lots of really great shops featuring pottery, beautiful paper products, galleries, paintings.It's definitely worth a walk around this area to take home some special gifts from Korea."
Has sadly lost its artsy feel; touristy,"This area sadly has morphed into another touristy area full of the usual shops that you can find elsewhere. The same cosmetics places, and the same coffee/dessert chains. There are loads of shops selling the same Korean souvenirs/traditional stuff, and I noted that the things progressively got more expensive as you approached the front-end of the street. There is that little shopping centre with 4 floors (SsamziegiI) which I didn’t go this time around, but I think is worth a visit. It’s best to avoid during the weekends though as the paths outside the shops are very narrow and it gets very crowded and annoying when you want to browse. The things are pretty unique and the shops quite charming though. I also had to do some last-minute cosmetics shopping for a friend, and though I bought a lot of items, I found that the shops no longer give out that many samples compared to a few years ago. I still prefer this place over the other touristy areas (Dongdaemun, Myeongdong etc) and have some fond memories here and came here just for the Bonjok Porridge restaurant (!) , but I found it boring this time around and doubt I would ever visit again to be honest!"
Quality Art and Culture can be found in Insadong,"This is a great area, close to major hotels, for those travellers who love the local art scene. There are plenty of galleries exhibiting the works of talented well known Korean artists. Gem stores provide a wide selection of amethyst pieces and the late set clothing fashions can be found in this area. There are interesting and quaint cafés and eateries. Walking is easy and fun. Shop owners and staff are friendly and do not urge you to purchase. They are very generous with their time to explain how things are made."
A place worth going ,"Try to spend few hours there, you will find a lot of traditional and interesting goods. This is a place where you can find some gifts for friends and family. "
Average,Insadong got a lot of shop along the road. This shopping area is smaller than Myeongdong around 5 times. The shop there got a lot of shop sell souvenir which I don't like. I only like the small cactus shop inside the mall in my picture and Osulloc Cafe. 
Not to be missed,"You must visit Insadong! It is a great neighborhood full of artist and tourist shops as well as restaurants. Don't miss the ""poop bread"" located inside Ssamziegil (google it). Also a great place to find local artist collections."
Charming neighbourhood,Spend at least 2 hours here to check out the cute cafes and shops and on a weekend rub shoulders with the young hipster Koreans
shopping area,a place to get souvenirs at a cheap price. found unique souvenirs here too. many eateries and cafes in the area. can also walk to bukchon hanok village after exploring here
Great shopping,"This is the neighborhood to visit for classy and artful jewelry, pottery, clothing, art and above average souvenirs. Small streets, engaging hustle and bustle of tourists."
nice shopping place,"also has many souvenir shops, should hv bought here, price slightly cheaper than Myeongdong. probably more competition. "
Shopping shopping :),A street away from our hotel. Lots of food. Lots of shops. Got a dojang. Enjoyed a traditional meal at Arirang Restaurant and even a Hoddek from a street vendor. 
Quaint,I liked this area of Seoul. It is more historic and less big city like. It is fun to walk around and there are some good restaurants here.
street market galore,"enjoy the street market experience, plenty bric-a- brac to choose from, artistic, creative individuals with their own designs. some stalls have demonstration on their famous dessert-making, look out for the Eastern European guy, speaking perfect Korean and selling cone icecream with his neat little tricks entertaining young kids.A fun place to be, a lovely place to try eateries, maybe pick up something you fancy.There is a restaurant on the 2nd floor shop which sells the famous Korean ginseng chicken soup, (black or white chicken), he has been operating for 40 years, friendly with welcoming smile. I have tried others but this one is more authentic."
"Lovely stroll, restaurant and shop mix, old houses, atmospheric",You can easily spend 1/2 day here and see what comes your way. I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere. You can walk in and out of shops without getting hasseled. Interesting alleyways to discover ... more! At least 2 vegetarian restaurants here. 
nice place for shopping,"insadong is a good place for shopping, got alot of souvenir shops, skin care shops, local handmade crafts and can experience korea culture here... some souvenirs price at insadong are cheaper as compare to myeongdong..."
Restauarants and stores galore,Interesting place to browse. Seems like there is every kind of food or shop you can imagine. Just walked through the area but it was fascinating.
Boring with nothing exciting,"Was here on a Friday night before 9pm but more than half of the shops were closed. Couple of shops selling bags and name stamps were affordable & more unusual, but the rest were mainly bakeries, cafes and beauty products shops."
Walking street after palace visit,"After visiting one of the nearby palaces we went to Insadong for lunch and tourist shopping. We weren't disappointed. Had a great local meal, bought some nice trinkets (sho-chu pottery set) then enjoyed the street food and people watching all the way to the stream."
Art street,"We love the walking and shopping street, nice set up and easy to grasp local products we need, especially handicrafts and traditional arts. The ambience after 4pm on weekend was good. I love street live performances and how the audiences enjoy and engage with the shows."
Buy your uniquely Korean souvenirs here,"Insadong has a main walking street and several side streets. Small shops sell interesting art and craft and other items. . Of course there are shops selling the mass-production stuff as well, but go for the hand-crafted items, and you can probably find yourself a unique souvenir to remember your trip to Korea. Ssamziegil mall is along the main street....with its spiralling corridor along which you will find many independent small shops. If you visit, I also strongly recommend getting off the main street to explore some of the very interesting food options along the side streets."
Cafe heaven,A variety of coffee shop and also tea shop. You will be spoilt for choices of dessert. If tea is your thing this place also offer variety of teas also place to try their Korean traditional dessert plus tea
A nice blend of old city and modern trends,"I like Insadong for seeing and purchasing Korean crafts and art. They have traditional things such as pottery and hanji, and they also have some modern jewelry makers and fashion outlets that aren't big box stores - nice! It's a great place to spend half a day."
A Souvenir Shop to give as gifts!,"There are lots of stalls selling souvenirs - keychains, shirts, ref magnets, scarf, jewelries, foods, etc.some stall sell the the same items, while others sell more unique stuff - more personalized items like calligraphy shop and stamp shop.Prices are mostly the same the difference are the designs."
arts n crafts,"was trying to hold myself dearly from buying all those awesome art n crafts product. ssamji-gil was interesting, bought some potteries as an atypical souvenir from korea. if u love handmade fancy paper, this is the place to shop til u drop. "
Only if u have time to spare or craft intrested,Only if u have time to spare or craft intrested.Nothing much to see or do .better make use of your time
Touristy Tea Shop Area,"I stayed in this area and I really enjoyed it. It is a bit touristy but I liked the many quaint tea shops and cafes and other little gift shops around. Some of the clothing shops were very expensive. You can also find cheap touristy trinkets. It was a nice area to sit and have tea. On the weekend, there were quite a few Koreans dressed in the traditional clothes stopping and posing for pictures with tourists. In the evening, there was always someone singing in the street, and there were a few food carts selling snacks along the street. A nice place to spend a few hours."
Do a tea house hop in insadong,"A friend and I spent the day just hopping from tea house to tea house, eating little snacks along the way. It couldn't have been a more enjoyable day of delicious tea and exploring."
Filled with arts and souvenirs,"We only walked the main street and it was filled with souvenirs shop, calligraphy shop and street vendors selling snacks. Some interesting things here are the name stamps shop, the snack shops tucked in alleys and some people going around in hanbok. There are some tea houses too selling the famous patbingsoo dessert and.... tea! ^^"
Walking street,"Ir is a good place for a walk, find a gift or to eat something Korean to spend a lovely afternoon if you already have seen the mayor attractions in Seoul, like Gyeongbokgung or Sungnyemun Gate"
Traditional Charm Mixed with Touristy,A lovely area to shop and find a traditional souvenir or the typical trinket type but all in a pleasant setting amidst many side alleys offering numerous traditional tea houses and restaurants. This was a real highlight of my visit. 
Nice place to visit,"We went on a Saturday afternoon and it had a carnival like atmosphere. There were people dressed up in traditional hanbok and made it even more special. There were groups singing folk songs, playing musical instruments and dancing traditional dances.All in all, we had a lovely Saturday afternoon in Insadong."
Get your souvenirs and tea cups here,"You can find your souvenirs here; tea cups, wind chimes, name stamp etc. Many restaurants and tea houses along the street. Do drop by after visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace and it's close to the Cheonggyecheon Stream."
Cool Art Street with lots of shops and Galleries,"Actually my favorite area in Seoul from our visit. Not as many people as Myeungdong nor as big but just as interesting. There are lots of touristy commercial shops but it also includes a big number of art galleries and unique pop up type shops you will only find here. There are not as many of the ubiquitous face mask/ makeup shops you see in many other areas. Here you find a lot of antique shops, curios, street artists, and one off concept stores which probably wont be around the next time you visit! Also has a pretty fair number of decent restaurants and tons of cafes. And it's only 15 minutes walking distance from Myeungdong. Beware this place close much earlier as it's not a night time party place. Many places close at 8pm. The coffee shops close later though. Definitely one of the must places to go visit in Seoul."
leisure shopping street,"It is easy to reach by metro line, exit at Anguk Station and walk about 5 minutes et voila, you have an alley full of unique stalls. There are bag shops with really cheap price, clothes, handmade souvenirs, antiques, and ancient painting tools as well as ancient caligraphy tools. Food stalls are also availbale. They are all availbale at bargainable prices. There is tourist information at the end of the street that provide map. The officer are fluent in english and would happily help us about the tourist information. The centre tourist information provides hangbok to be used for 20 kinutes for 3.000 won which is too pricey. But overall its a must do."
Great place for shopping nic nacs and souvenirs,Great place for walking and eating street foods and buying nic nacs for giveaways.We tried some of the street foods and it was nice.Worth visiting. 
Slightly touristy but still worth a visit,Lots of tourists here but still worth a visit if just to walk down Insadong and get the feel of the street that houses a lot of souvenir and also art & craft shops. There are also a lot of good restaurants here so be sure to grab lunch at one of the Korean restaurants - I went to a local restaurant where I had the best kimchi fried rice ever. Lots of snacks there as well - I had perhaps what is the most in-fashion dessert - Tiramisu ice cream!!Insadong can also be done with Bukchon in the same half day.
Disappointing,I side with the reviewers that were disappointed with this part of Seoul. It gets a lot of hype in the tour guides but I found it touristy with not a lot of tempting shops. Ok if you have run out of things to do but not worth putting high on your list.
Not what it use to be,"A one time favorite, Insadong has become too touristy. The tea museums and restaurants are wonderful, but the shop prices have sky rocketed. Still a good place to go, but don't expect too much. "
Leisurely walk,"We had a nice, leisurely walk down Insadong. My teen daughter bought lots of specialty art pens and stuff that she says you were either hard to find or were really expensive back home. Cute souvenirs everywhere. Try the pancake that they sell on the street. A yummy treat on a cold day."
Take the Royal Asiatic Tour to get a sense of Insadong with journalists and English speaking lon time residents,"The tour is reasonable and gives you a sense of prized back alleys, lanes named after horse movement, popular ole local bars and the construction/car free jumble which populates this touristy area"
Tourist area but still attractive,It is a tourist area with small shops selling local souvenirs along the pave way. There is a complex with winding stairs and a wishing card bridge on its top. There are quite a few interesting shops in the complex which worth visiting.There are quite a lot restaurants behind the pedestrian main street serving typical Korea set menu. Had some drink in the Jeju tea shop which is just fine.
So many shops to see,"Insadong is a perfect place for a person who loves shopping. A lot of shops offering local fashion brand, cosmetics and foods. This place also have a lot of street food such as tteobokki, hotteok, and boonguhpang. Must visit place when you go to seoul."
Great for Traditional Art and Souvenirs,Insadong is a great place to see. It is wonderful for shopping and a lovely walking area. It's a must see in Seoul if you are visiting. There are a lot of cultural shows here. Protests often take place at the park across the street from the main entrance as well. I have been here several times and seemed to learn something new about Korea each time.
Loved this place,This was such a great place to visit. There are literally a ton of alleys from the main Insadong road! There's a lot of cute little coffee shops to take a break and just enjoy the scenery:)... We loved going early when the crowds of people were not there yet.. Makes better for picture opportunities when there aren't crowds of people! Great place to pick up some pottery :)
Touristic jumble,Insadong didn't impress me. Too much touristic jumble for sale. The Myengdong area had a lot more to offer when it comes to shopping. 
An ok place to walk around and try local food stand cuisine,Nothing really special about this area.. it is a cute place to try local cuisine and do some souveneirshopping. Go for the food.
One of my favourite,"Insadong is one of my favourite places to go to have a cup of tea... Not just any tea from coffee shops but traditional tea from persimmon leave to quince tea. You can see various shops serving traditional tea which comes with sweet snacks. You can choose from modern style tea shops to small shops with a more traditional setting. There are also restaurants which serve traditional food including one of my favourites - sujaebi. One of the key to find good places is to not be afraid of walking at the small alleys. You can find all sort of shops selling various things from traditional goods to clothes besides the restaurants and tea shops. If you look around, you will also realize that all shops are written in Korean including Starbucks. Insadong is the only place where you find the signs are all written in Korean as to preserve the Korean-ness within that area. For those who enjoy art, this is also the place to drop by as there are various art galleries around the area."
"Great place to walk around, look at antique shops and have diner","Each time we are in Seoul we go to Insadong. Nice to walk around, visit the shops and offcourse have diner. There are several small restaurants at the alleys that cater very good food. Try mandu chongol at a small restaurant with a big window so you can see the mandu being freshly made."
Wonderful arts from Korea ,If you truly want to experience the Korean culture you should come to Insadong ~ here you can find many arts and crafts if you're into Pottery goodbye really beautiful artwork and pottery plates and pots. If you want to avoid the crowds the best time to visit this area is early spring or late fall.
A treasure trove,"So many merchandise to see, like the typical souvenirs (keychain, shirt, ref magnet, chopsticks) to semi-precious stone trinkets, jade rollers and other traditional stuff that one can buy. There are also many food stalls that offer yummy Korean streetfood. Cosmetics shops are present, but not as plenty as in Myeongdong. Clothes shops are also there but not as many as in Hongdae or Dongdaemun. There are also restos around the place. Just do not go there beyond 7pm because streetsellers will have packed up and the other stores closed by then (but restos are still open). To be safe, maybe latest visit should be before 4 or 5pm?"
Love Insadong,"I cannot emphasise how much I actually fell in love with Insadong! Apart from the crazy load of people there on a weekend, this place is really for artsy people!I love the art galleries and the small malls that were around. And to add on, there was an O'sulloc in that area! Guys, if you love green tea, go give O'sulloc a try, the green tea is so solid in their soft serve ice cream! Oh, not to forget, there were a large amount of street food, clothes and ₩10,000 bags shop!Take the metro to Anguk station and take a short walk to Insadong! Have fun!"
Terrific fun!,"This is a terrific street to visit in Seoul. It's accessible from several different Metro stations, and can be combined with other visits, such as to Bukchon Hanok Village.We came here twice it was so good.And don't forget the little alleyways off the main street pedestrian mall - we found a tiny place with a combination platter of steamed and fried dumplings for only 8000won up one of those alleys.It's very popular with locals and tourists alike, and gets very busy on week-ends.There are tourist shops and souvenir shops, art, pottery and photo galleries, coffee shops and eateries - so much to see.There are some street food vendors too - try the chicken and spring onion barbeque skewers. I liked the octopus cooked on hot coals too. And my wife loved the Turkish ice cream.Just go there!"
This is a MUST to visit if you are in Korea!!!,"If you are looking for a gift to take home or looking for your friends and family gifts, this is the place. great reasonable shops and restaurants!!! you'll even find some street performers."
You must go to Insadong,"Insadong is the place to go for authentic Korean souvenirs, the street is lined with shops ranging from clothes, jewelry, trinkets of every type, I bought myself a beautiful Mother of Pearl Box, intricately designed, when I got home I was wishing I had bought more for gifts (that's the problem when you hesitate buying something, you regret it later) So seize the moment, if you see something you love the looks of, grab it, don't hesitate. We even came across a store selling gems and fossils, it was interesting just looking at everything. The food in Insadong is amazing, every eating place is so in-expensive, you could eat at a different place morning,noon and night and never get bored, you'd just want more. In the evening there are street vendors selling yummy food which we've never had a problem with. There is a couple of shopping malls along the main street with a lot of quirky selling themes, it's an amazing place to visit, you won't be disappointed."
Very nice Korean experience!,"Insadong can provide the nicest, or the most cliche, of modern Korea! We enjoyed a violinist and guitarist ... Two musicians who were among the best ever street musicians of my life!"
Lively tourist street,"This is the area to pick up souvenirs, the street is lined with shops. There is a small shopping mall here and there is some original poducts. We bought a few things from here. On the street there is a couple of guys with signs advertising a dumpling shop, go try it the food it is really good. We ate at a couple of these and the food was always fresh and hot."
interesting place,made in korea souvenior selling 1000KRW here. the food also selling cheap compare with other areas. a nice place to visit.
Korean shopping!,If you want more Korean cultural shopping... this is the place to go. I bought a Mother of Pearl jewelry box to store my late mother's memorabilia. 
Interesting tourist street,There is a very cute shopping mall there that you should see. It's easy enough to find so just look for it otherwise there are tourists shop with lots of interesting wares and the ambiance of the street is also nice. I really liked it. 
Oops! Half the day gone.,"Cool place for a wander, but be warned you'll end up spending too much time and money here!Nice shops and stalls and good restaurants, even for veggies."
Traditional souvenirs area,"It's pretty near to the Hanok village, walk around for cafe hopping and enjoy the scenery. Hop around for some shops selling souvenirs as well, all the shops should be more or less the same. "
So many art galleries,"Super cool area, wasn't expecting to find so many art galleries everywhere. Also many traditional craft stalls / shops."
Very Nice Walk,"It is a pedestrian free zone like in numerous cities throughout Europe where you don’t have to worry about cars except here you still have to watch out for those pesky moped deliveries. If you want to buy genuine Korean stuff this is not the place to shop, 99.9% of stuff sold here is made in China with very bothersome sales people. Great place to eat real genuine Korean dishes."
Great for shopping and eating out.,Great for shopping and eating out in small authentic local restaurants. Great for walking and sightseeing too.
Very Good Pedestrian Road,"We visited the Insadong during Sunday and was happy to see many young Koreans wore their traditional dresses to walk in the street. Their movement in traditional dresses added the needed atmosphere to made the pedestrian street unique. Insadong known for its antique market in the past however the merchandised had completely changed. There are variety of daily products eg. cosmetic, dresses, souvenirs, sold throughout. We had about an hour however more time was needed to enjoy the place."
Amazing walk,"From the moment I arrived at Anguk station,I was mesmerized by some of artwork I found along the way and easily fall in love with this place."
Touristy but charming,"Many traditional craft stalls, galleries and tea shops dot the area.Very easy to get to from any part of Seoul via the fabulous subway system. A pleasant way to spend a few hours."
Souvenirs & Memories,A good place for a Budget Friendly Shopping for Souvenirs & the variety is good with Budget happy goods... Only wish more people could speak English...
Something for everyone,"Whether you're looking for souvenirs, or to enjoy Korean cosine, sample the king's candy from the vendors, or look for Korean antiques, there is something for everyone in this blocked of from traffic shopping area. "
A worth visit area,The ssamziegil shops is a MUST-GO if u visit insadong. Could feel the culture of Korea via the handmade ceramics and antique shops. worth for a visit!
Korean souvenir street,"I was told by a local that Insadong is a must visit for first timers to Seoul. I'm not much of a souvenir shopper but I could see the variety of souvenirs were very good from the ubiquitous magnets to hancrafted bags and traditional writing brushes. In terms of souvenirs, this is better than a market such as Gwangjang so I agree that tourists looking for these things should come here. You will not be disappointed. This is also near the Bukchon village and the unique Cheonggyecheon stream which should be very easy to find on a tourist map."
Looking for hanbok? ,"Insadong offers a variety of shopping from clothing to souvenirs. We did most of our souvenir shopping here as we were happen to visit the area (but i guess it's cheaper if you shop in traditional market). Worth mentioning that you could find a lot of hanbok shops around, the offer traditional and modern type of hanbok, but in general hanbok prices are expensive, but surely can find a lot of options here. If youre visiting bukchon village, drop down here to have a look, its walking distance from there. Lots of street food around as well."
Fun place to visit!,"I have traveled to Seoul five times in the last two years for business but never had the time to do touristy things. Someone had recommended Insadong and I loved it! It's filled with shops, cafes, restaurants and street vendors. Some of the tea shops were very charming (look for ones that look like small house) serving very high quality herbal teas. It's also a great place to shop for Korean gifts, and taste some of Korean culture.Plan on spending an afternoon where you can have lunch, shop then do tea. It's very touristy and can be very crowded with both locals and tourists. Most business owners including street carts spoke English."
For leisure,"The food there is great. Ssamgil, Alive Museum and some other fun activities are in Insadong. This place is suitable for the young and hang out with friends. "
On the Seoul tourist trail,"Insadong is a must-go place for everyone visiting Seoul for the first time. Although the street is littered with Korean tourist kitsch, it also boasts plenty of attractive stores offering creative art, ceramics and antiques. Expect the prices to be on the somewhat upper side and watch for the stores in the side alleys. In the evening, street artists create a lively and inviting atmosphere."
Touristy,Walked to Insadong after visiting Gyeongbokgung. We were disappointed as the street was mostly souvenir shops and didn't feel authentic. 
A lovely lively street beaming with culture ,I like the street and it's fun to walk around there. A new trend has started with students wearing hanbok and the get a free ticket to Gyongbuk palace. Lots of museums with art for all people. The restaurants there are nice and you need to walk around before you choose. A great place to visit in Seoul :-) 
Vibrant Place for the Young,"This place is very hip and happening. Filled with all kinds of interesting shops, food, clothes, accessories. Good place to hang out. "
To get gifts for friends in USA,This was the place to go for getting gifts for friends that is for sure. There was lots to see & do as well I got my Han Bok pictures made in this area as well.
Shops shops shops everywhere ,"Although is the street of traditional things, gifts and souvenirs are quite expensive. Here you can find a shop to rent a hanbok and get free entrance at the palace. Try korean pancakes or green tea ice cream, delicious! "
Great lunch spot after visiting the palaces or Bukchon area,"Our last stop to pick up souvenirs and try some street food. The Sunday afternoon atmosphere was pleasant and did not feel over crowded. It is very close to the Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces and the Bukchon area. We also spotted Hollywood celebrity Chloe Moretz being serenaded and interviewed in the streets. I can't comment on price comparisons but I picked up a few small things and the street food was inexpensive. I especially liked the pancake type stall that filled the pancake with sugar, honey and peanuts. "
Shopping area with traditional and modern wares; touristy,"Walking distance from Changdeokgung Palace so easy to see on the same day. Walked around, had a coffee and did not find anything to buy. There were cruise tour groups dropped off in bunches and it seemed touristy to me, but still worth it because I got a good feel for local crafts and souvenirs. Allow an hour at most and you'll see plenty."
Souvenir shopping,"The street directs you to the Korean modern galleries & tea shops.Haggle more to get the best price :)Cheap backpacks, hats, some Korean style casual dress, chopsticks, place mats, etc..will be found here.I got packages of Korean traditional music instruments & Tae-kwon-do coasters \m/Starbucks and several cafe are along the street, don't worry to get thirsty. "
"Artsy, Touristy, and fun","Lots of fun. Definitely made for tourists.  Lots of gift shops, art shops, restaurants, street eats, and tourists! "
Quaint,"You'll see the authentic Seoul in this area. It's nice to walk around with some old restos and small stores. I liked the shoes I bought from a small (almost sidewalk vendor) shop, for only 10k Won. "
Nice antiques and souvenirs,"Very nice antiques and typical Korean souvenirs. I have been there for the second time after last years visit and again like it very much. A touristic place, nonetheless nice!"
Not to miss..,Our hotel was just 5-minute walk to Insadong. Insadong is a great place to try Korean dishes and heaven to dessert lovers. We found a lot souvenir shops on street corners. Most prices are fixed so I suggest try to visit all shop first and do price comparison before buying.
Still the place for tourists and souvenir seekers,"It's my go-to place for a new visitor to the city. Even with the commercialization done to it, Insadong, is still the place for newcomers to buy souvenirs and see traditional aspects to Seoul. I recommend the Gyesong mandu place for a more traditional and delicious meal than the tourist traps."
Shopping afternoon,Insadong is a lovely place to buy Korean paintings and other traditional objects. There are many delightful tea houses to be visited serving teas such as pine needles or omija which are both delicious and nothing like anything in England.It is great to walk up and down this street as it is pedestrianised and rightly so. Make sure you visit a few shops before buying to check all of the options as there are so many.It's a must visit part of Seoul.
Always on my visit list,"I always visit Insadong area if there any foreign friends come to Seoul. Lot things to see, shop and eat :) don't forget to try Hanbok (Korean traditional clothes) at Insadong Tourist Information only for 3.000won!"
Avoid tourist restaurants! Try real Korean food,Ask your local Korean friends (if any..) or push your travel guides for real Korean traditional restaurants hidden in the back streets. The quality range of restaurants is really wide. There are good restaurants for vegetarians as well.
Treasure finds,"This place has many wonderful places to shop and eat. You can pick up souvenirs, unique art and street food. My partner took me here and surprised me with couple rings. The atmosphere was very interesting as you try to look at everything. I enjoyed here more compared to myeongdong. "
For the arts lover,"A recommended place to visit for arts lovers! It's a traditional street where you can find lots of cultural related stuff including tea houses and museums. This place is very popular among the tourists too.For those interested to visit, stop at Anguk station and from Exit 6, go straight for 100m before turning left into Insadong. Ssamzigil shopping mall is also located here."
Always a great visit,Insadong is one of my favorite places to visit in Seoul. Tea Houses are a must to stop by for some traditional tea and Korean rice cookies.
Not to miss walking and shopping!,"Even in cold weather, the walk in Insadong is worth it. Don't miss the shops with pottery, modern design pieces, handcrafted items and especially, Buddhist-related artifacts. The design museum located in Insadong is worth the trip, as is the gift shop. Also on your walk, visit the huge Buddhist temple."
Very infesting street,"A chance to see Seoul in the flesh, stalls, market and plenty of life to see. Shopping inexpensive - worth a visit"
Historic area with nice shops and restaurants,"i really like this area, beautiful historic buildings, full of interesting shops and many great traditional Korean restaurants, must visit if you come to Seoul."
My favourite area in Seoul,"This area is full of little shops, eateries and galleries showcasing traditional handcraft, Korean costume, souvenir, etc. You can get unique souvenirs from here. Had lunch in a restaurant on a side street and an afternoon tea set at Osulloc, both fantastic."
Korean Culture on display,An incredible experience to walk through this area during holiday time in winter when thousands of Koreans are alos walking through this traditional shopping and restaurant area.
shopping for souvenir,i think this is the best place to shop for your souvenir. they are a lot cheaper. i regret that that i only bought a few here because I thought myeongdong street is better.
Very nice shopping area,"This is a great shopping, dining, and sight-seeing area. It's close to other attractions and sights, so it's good for lunch during a day of sightseeing!"
Very cool area in Seoul,"This neighborhood was very fun and I recommend you visit while in Seoul. When we went it was snowing pretty badly and that kinda sucked but the shops were still open. We visited a museum and some galleries there and that was cool because we were indoors. After the galleries and the museum, it had stopped snowing and all the shops were open and it was very pleasant. The souvenirs were the cheapest I found and you can haggle the prices here. If you have time, visit Insa Dong since it is very near bus stops and the Metro."
Great place to get your souvenirs..,At the start of the Insadong Street there is a shop selling cheap bags @10k won. Vy nice n trendy bag. Quite a bargain
Shop! Eat! Sightsee!,"A must in your trip. You can look for great cheap finds. I bought here my paintings, traditional masks, give aways, bell, sculptures and cheap cosmetics. Then rest in one of the cute cafe along this street."
Nice but not a must!,"Nice to walk around the main street, but nothing special for me anyways.Sovenirs stores are the same as any other place, though had a great hot dark chochlate at ddongcafe"
pretty and fashion,"High end places yet a bit expensive. Lots of trendy people lives here. Should check out so many brand flagship stores here! Lots of good cafe inside the store, like cafe Dior and cafe Hermes, very interesting. And when night comes, theres the most popular clubbing place, young people gather and party till very late, like around 6. Should check out this most popular places now in Seoul!現今最時尚最流行的地方有很多名牌旗艦店坐落，而且裡面有的有設咖啡廳像是迪奧旗艦店和愛馬仕的書店咖啡館都在這附近"
cool shopping,"Area full of small boutiques, interesting souvenirs and gifts. Best Korean pancakes! fun place to walk around."
Lovely place to browse for handcrafts and arty things,"You can get lovely tea here (Ossuloc) and their tea room is gorgeous; you get a little match cookie with your tea and a timer to tell you when the leaves have sufficiently steeped. There are some pretty shops with hand made mother of pearl and lacquer boxes which open up to reveal little drawers for jewellery. They also sell little keyrings, bookmarks and embroidered cushions. Nice for souvenirs. Korea is famous for amethyst and you can also get lovely geodes and crystals here"
Large Market place for traditional products and not only,"Located in the Jongno-gu district, the area is a market place (Insadong-gil street and the surroundings) where you can find traditional Korean tea cups, mugs, plates, artworks, clothes...everything that you can imagine. The prices are quite high but you can negotiate especially if you plan to buy more things. It is indeed crowded but it's one of the places that you have to visit if you plan to go back home with some souvenirs. It is one of the places that every local in Seoul would recommend to the foreigners. "
Nothing special,"Insadong is supposed to be as a traditional Korean street to find lots of souvenirs, but the street is the same as any other main streets in Seoul. They sell same things and have some unique restaurants, but most of the shops in Insadong are chains, that can be found anywhere in Seoul."
Mix of old and new,"In Insadong, you will find new trendy shops for young people and traditional shops selling Korean desserts, art and craft and souvenirs in Insadong."
Trying Kultare (Korean traditional food),Walking along insadong I found several shops selling Korean traditional snack and merchandise. The interesting one is Kultare Shop. The seller will show you some attraction how to make kultare..you can try it for free but they will convince to buy without able to reject :D
Another shopping area,I didn't find much to be impressed about here. Definitely more stalls selling souvenir-appropriate items but there are usually cheaper alternatives elsewhere. Visit only if you are not done with your souvenir shopping and have a strong interest in traditional arts and crafts.
Buzzing with commercialism,"This place was recommended by a Korean friend, but did not quite live up to the expectation. It feels overly commercial and crowded."
Cheap Souvenirs!,"Since Insadong is just around Bukchon, Gyeongbokgung palace and Changdeokgung palace, who might want to stroll and shop around the area where you can buy South Korea's best souvenirs. You can find colorful silk pouches, key chains, nail cutters, joseon king and queen bookmarks, hanbok stickers, embroideries, authentic paintings, tea sets, charms, colorful painted fans, Hanbok sets and a lot more. "
Shops and restaurants,"There are so many restaurants in Insadong we had a hard time deciding what we should eat. And if you are looking for souvenirs, this is the place to shop in."
Lunch and day trip from Seoul Airport,Loved the shopping area in this district - very quaint and original with a great selection of shops and street food.
Shopping and eating ,"This is another shopping area if you are looking for some costume jewelry, scarfs and lots of restaurants nearby to this place. "
Definitely a must,"There are a lot of interesting stuff to see in Insadong, if you're interested in shopping there'll be a lot better prices in other places nearby, but it's definitely a great place to have a taste of Korean culture and food."
Good for walk around but a little expensive,Plenty of local handicrafts and potteries. I checked a few items but found the prices to be on the higher side so did not buy much here. But good street to explore as a tourist
"Artsy, creative, cool","I loved this part of Seoul. It had life and was interesting. There is shopping, and art. It is also littered with fun street foods and cafes. This is a must go in my book for Seoul. One of the best places to go to. We found cute and funny shops. Like a shop that sold famous artwork but with cats in place of the people. We also got to take purikura (Japanese style photo sticker booths) in Korean hanbok. This is something you must do! There are street performers sometimes too.And we ate dongpang ""poop bread"" haha it's like a pancake in the shape of a swirly poo filled with chocolate! Weird and delicious. That was my idea I wanted to find this place so badly!Take your time here. You'll never know what you'll run into next."
Insadong shopping for made in Korea goods,"Visited there with my Korean friend who told me most everything is made in Korea in this little alley of shops. I purchased two beautiful scarves, Made in Korea. All others made in China (so sad),"
when in seoul...and you want a taste of their culture.,"as we enter insadong, there's a group of musicians in traditional costume rehearsing for a show that night. after just a few steps,, there's a line of street food stalls which smells and look really good.. then rows of stores selling locally-made products and more importantly, beauty products - a woman's world indeed! we had traditional korean lunch in one of the shops. this is one way of enjoying their culture - music, food and shopping! :-)"
"""Love it!""- A place to remember","Everything I love is here: Art, craft, nice people, good food, beautiful weather in August...I could spend hours walking around, looking at many artistic shops with lovely flowers, small plans and...taking picture.If you are similar to me, you will love Insa-dong, Seoul!"
Insadong,Way too touristy to me. It was extremely crowded and didn't offer anything I could find that I wouldn't find elsewhere. I guess shopaholics might like it but I felt the same things could be found elsewhere.
Shopping!!!,Its like Myeongdong but more on the affordable side! Insadong has a lot of galleries where local artist can exhibit their artworks. Also coffee shop is everywhere and you can buy a lot of cheap souvenirs here!
Great place to shop,"For me Insadong is the best place to shop in Seoul if you are looking for antiques, pottery or good quality souvenirs. I love the look and feel and while it is quite touristic is keeps an aura of authenticity "
Insadong- great for souvenirs,"nice shopping area to find souvenirs shops of cheap traditional korean craft for tourists,the main problem is all the stores have the same inventory"
Great place for Souvenirs,"Very good place to buy souvenirs, very unique Korean art and crafts that you can find only Insadong. Cute collections of socks, Pencil bags, tea cup, cooking accessories, hair accessories.. etc."
Too cold to really enjot,An interesting area as cooking displays and traditional papers and clothes for purchase but it was too cold to walk around that day.
Fun shopping area,"A nice half day stroll ; get to see shops , take your time, browse get a latte ; Suitable for everyone; wheel chair accessible"
Definitely worth a visit,"Very beautiful area with many tourist attractions, the street food is excellent as well as some of the ""hidden"" coffee shops. good place to purchase souvenirs."
Shoppers' heaven!,"If you look for cheaper souvenir, dont forget to go to insadong! It was around 2,000 won cheaper compared to in Namdaemun and other market areas.Many bags were also sold there for 10,000 won all items. Really shoppers heaven!The other amazing thing is that there was a place to try hanbok there in Insadong Tourist Centre for 3000won per person, but the photo is taken with your own camera. Selfie stick is provided.Good place for tourist! A must go!"
Street foods galore!,"Best tasting street foods I've tasted, so far! There are plenty of things to do and eat in Insadong. Though it could be crowded sometimes"
Souvenir area,"Insadong shopping is mainly focus on one long street.This is a good place to shop for souvenir as you can find many Korea traditional items selling here. Price acceptable, and the items look better quality compare to those in the night market. You can find many restaurants here. Recommend for day time shopping, estimated about 3 hrs."
great for souveniers,"Go to this area if you're looking for souveniers to bring back home. Although the prices of the souveniers are not as cheap as the ones from Singapore. The keychains and fridge magnets range from 2000-7000 won. You can mostly find artworks, coin purses, chopsticks, cellphone cases, scarves, hand gloves and traditional bags here in the area. This is also walking distance from the Bukchon hanok village. This is like 15 minutes walk away from here. I did not see much of the street food vendors like those in Myeongdong. "
Traditional shopping - arts and crafts,"This is a must to see and buy a range of traditional and modern arts and crafts in Seoul.Wear comfortable shoes and clothing and allow a few hours. We went there using the ""hop -on, hop-off"" bus."
Great place to buy very Korean souvenir,"Insadong looks like a street, but don't forget to explorer narrow alleys behind the main street. Osulloc cafe was the best place to buy Korean tea. "
Shopping area with famous poo-themed coffee cafe.,Fun shopping area with traditional souvenir shops as well as unique handmade items. Check out the pooh-themed coffee shop on the top level of the mall. Some shops prices are reasonable while others are quite high. 
Lovely laidback district,"Insadong was very enjoyable. Lots of character and culture packed into the wider roads (relative to other districts) with streetfood vendors every few steps. If you want to feel what it's like to be Korean as opposed to a tourist in Korea, I recommend you stop by Insadong. Bear in mind there isn't much to do other than wander the streets and relax so if youre looking for adventure or great sights, you may want to make this a short stop."
Charming street with traditional and unique shops,"Unlike the chain retailers and beauty shops in Myeongdong, Insadong has stores selling art, traditional handicraft, and local souvenirs. There are also some modern specialty shops selling unique creations by local designers.It’s great place to wander around and don’t forget to explore the side alleys, too, there are some gems to be unearthed there."
Art district,"I go there for the art, shops, people watching and food. Make sure you explore the different alleys. Vendors are very foreigner friendly. Great place to pick up decent souvenirs that aren't found in Itaewon."
"Shopping, eating and free performance!","Everytime i go to Seoul, i never failed to go to Insadong for some souvenir shopping! This is your place if you want to buy some shirts, fans, clothes and eat street foods while watching some cultural dances! "
Lots of unique shops and restaurants,"We love visiting Insadong and its unique shops and restaurants. We always find something new and different whenever we go. Although there are many shops with mass made touristy items, there are also lots of shops with handmade unique items and family owned shops. There are also lots of restaurants with amazing foods. Our favorite is in an alley beside the 5 story open air mall; they have a great plum tea. We could spend a full day in Insadong, just walking through the mail thoroughfare and down the alleys, and still have things we missed. "
Great way to spend an afternoon,"Insadong is one of my favorite places in Seoul. There is a shop for just about everything, and the food carts and stalls offer delicious options that you can eat as you are walking. You can find handmade items, clothing, souvenirs, pretty much anything you can think of. Just a tip though--if you buy food that has a container or wrapper, you'll be carrying it around until you go back to your hotel or to the train. There are no garbage cans anywhere!"
Enjoyable to spend a few hours immersing in culture.,"Amongst the standard tourist souvenir shops are artesian art/ craft, tea, ceramics and house decore shops. Don't limit yourself to the main pedestrian street. Criss cross the narrow alleys and fon't fear getting lost as you can always link back to the central thorough fare. Prices are overall fair so don't go expecting to bargin hard."
Handicraft street,One street filled with handicraft item. Visit when u have time. Theres is osulloc there and one shopping mall
My wife's fav place in Seoul,"This is a great area to explore, quite 'arty' and a good walking street with some lovely old style wooden type restaurants hidden up alley ways..."
Nice Street,"Good for a walk, souvenir shopping, along with nice cafe, food and restaurant. within walking distance with major attraction in Seoul"
Quaint shopping area / street for locals and tourists alike,Another awesome stop on our free Incheon airport transit tour. We had lunch here in a small alley in an even smaller dive restaurant we would never have found or dared enter for lunch ourselves. Traditional food was awesome. Super friendly people. The local area has lots of tourist stores but there are also genuine local stores and many street vendors. Great experience walking around here in this busy real shopping area (not unlike walking around in a China town somewhere - maybe only slightly more touristy).
Nice but you have to know where to look,"I would recommend you do your research before visiting Insa-dong.Go online and look for a walking tour for example.Or follow walking directions from a tour book.Otherwise you will be walking among many other tourists, looking at nothing but overpriced souvenir shops.There are many beautiful buildings, alleys and historical places to be seen here but without prior preparations, these might be hard to find.So do come prepared, unless of course you like souvenir shopping :-)"
Cream Cheese Croquette,"Insadong also a perfect place to buy sovenir.. Also there's one store that sell cream cheese, red bean croquette.. It's so delicious and popular, you have to queue to get that croquette. :)"
Interesting Areas away from Main shopping streets,"Interesting area away from main shopping areas and big brands. Quaint shops selling all kinds of things, definitely a place to check out."
"Insadong, The Art and Eating Spot","Insadong, with the nice surrounding, the combination between art, shopping mall, traditional place and teh important things is Foods"
Love visiting,"Second visit here. Brilliant for shopping for gifts. Lots of individual shops, lovely for browsing in the evening. For anyone visiting Seoul this has to be on yr itinerary. Within walking distance of some fantastic Korean guesthouses, so a great place to stay. And near most of the attractions.. "
Tourists only,"The quarter is beautiful, really typical. Sadly, it became a tourist trap. There are thousands of dulls shops and restaurants."
Souvenirs place,It is a great place in the downtown where you can buy some souvenirs. A lot of cosmetics shops are also there. Just in the downtown
A great place to shop and eat,"This is my 1st time visiting Insadong after my 4th visited to Korea. This is a wonderful place. There are lots of restaurant and shop in Insadong. The area is big, do allocate more time when you visit Insadong."
traditional souvenirs,"insadong is easily walkable from changdeokgung, gyeongbukgong and bukchon hanok village. a district that sells lots of traditional souvenirs and a place where you see people walking around in hanboks. it's a nice sight :) I personally feel that the traditional souvenirs are a little expensive though. but it's worth a visit if you like culture, food and art."
Great for a wander,Great to spend some time wandering and looking at the sights. Very busy on weekends. Had waffles freshly made from a vendor which were great.
Souvenirs,"Great place to find souvenirs, and art. On some days you may be able to catch a traditional historical reenactment. A really good place to browse, have a coffee and snack, or a traditional meal."
"Favorite neighborhood, cute stuff","If you like cute stuff, you'll enjoy a wander in Insadong neighborhood. A lot of the shops are unique, one of a kind. From clothes to houseware to souvenirs, all super cute."
Souvenirs and antiques,"This place was famous for its antiques, but these days it mainly sells souvenirs. It may not be much cheaper than other places, but the quality is better. I bought some korean drawstring pouches at a mall and compared to this place, the quality is just not the same. The place is not that big, but it's still fun walking around looking for the perfect souvenirs."
Fun and Great shopping ,"Whenever I visit Korea its my tradition to visit Insadong. I think it's must for any foreigner visiting Korea . It has many traditional Korean arts&crafts like calligraphy brushes, paper goods, traditional bags, many restaurants, street cart foods, cafes, galleries, tea shops and much much more. Seem always busy with people from all over the world. This time I even saw few foreigner/westerner are doing street entertainment. Wow time has changed. During my last visit (some years ago) I even saw Jackie Chen with his entourage. "
Great place for souvenirs,"There was a wide range of souvenir shops available in the area (though you might be able to find some of the same stuff for much cheaper on the 5th floor in Migliore, dongdaemun). Galleries and craft stores were interesting to browse about for cute, handmade goods "
Culture Visit,Did not spend a lot of time there but that 1 hour was nice as you ca find a lot of culture stuffs but DO NOT buy.. just google for the items and you can get the same item for lesser price.
Visit the tourist information centre,Try on the hanbok for a fee of 3000 won @ tourist information centre. Closing @ 5.30pm local time. Bring your own camera 
Souvenirs,"Best place to see Korean culture, art & antiques and to shop for your souvenirs. The vibe is old-world so it's very interesting. Some shops give discounts, too! "
Love the art and culture,"Along this street, there are lots of arts and culture goods for souvenirs- mostly handmade. Interesting and creative place. At the top floor of Ssamziegil shops you will find love locks and love notes for wishes and photo taking."
Street Food Heaven!,"Whether or not you are a foodie you will love it!Steamy hot chestnuts was the first thing i grabbed at followed by a couple of egg-bread rolls then a quick stop for coffee. A couple of souvenir stalls later then came lunch.. bring those banchans on and slurp away at the soup. A quick skip hop and a nap then another coffee downed with a churro and a traditional pancake filled with sugar, cinnamon and nuts. A stroll down to open air mall to pick up the poo pancakes filled with chocolate. A trip to the cat shop with the bags, hats, pins, magnets and everything else feline and then to finish off this heavenly outing a box of emperors desserts. Angel hair made out of sugar and filled with nuts black sesames. Not forgetting to pick up dinner Tobboki and fishcake skewers a roll or kimbap and then faint on the bed :D"
Traidtional Charm,Spent a lovely afternoon strolling along the street and had a nice break at one of the tea houses. Things to look out for: 1. Ssamziegil — Building loaded with artistic works2. Hotteok — Traditional Korean street pancake 3. O' Sulloc Tea House — More traditional Korean snacks in pretty packaging 
Traditional and Artsy,"The place for visitors who are fancy arts as well as the traditional side of Korea. An array of shops selling traditional clothes, accessories and souvenirs. Traditional restaurants and kiosks of street foods are in the vicinity as well. For a unique shopping experience, head to Ssamziegil . There are a lot of novelty shops as well as caricature artists."
Great deal for souvenir,"Went there each time I visited Seoul. Its a great place to walk around. Mainly its a walking street with tons of shops both side and all are very cheap. This street is a main focus for the tourists. Most of the shops sells souvenir of varieties. You will find lots of street shops for caps, shoes, T-shirts & Local Foods."
LOTS OF JEWELRY SHOPS,Walked a little but didn't enjoyed the shops: too many jewelry selling gold and some old watches. Lots of restaurants too. There are better areas in Seoul for tourist shopping.... 
An Experience,This is a good area to walk around. Lots of street vendors and restaurants. An easy walk to the palace and the metro.
Fun place to shop - don't miss the nearby temple,"This is a fun place to walk around and buy ""stuff"" to take home. They had traditional Korean items and toys, jewelry, clothes, etc.I was a bit annoyed that in some shops people follow directly behind you (pressed RIGHT up by you) to make sure you're not shoplifting, but I'm told not to take that personally and that it's common practice for some shop owners.I loved a little shop that was full of amethyst jewelry.There is a nearby temple that is worth the visit if you're shopping in Invading."
Korean style street,"Suitable for those who love antiques and that is the best place to shop for Korean stlye souvenirs. Apart from that there are also many shops on the shopping street. Almost all cosmetics shops there like Etude house, Innisfree, Aritaum and etc."
One of my favorite places in Seoul,"I have been many times and it has never lost its appeal. It's a great place to walk along the cobblestone streets and soak in the atmosphere. There are some lovely shops and great places to eat some authentic Korean food. If you have some free time, try to make it to Insadong. "
Great place to stroll about,"Most tourists love Insadong. As soon as anyone I knew visited, we'd take them there, and they usually loved it. It is close to other tourist area such as the palaces, hanok village, Bukhansan, the 4 peak hike, etc. Insadong is filled with little artist shops and musician stores. There are lots of little cafes, and restaurants. It is also very close tools downtown and cheongae cheon, if you want to stroll down a man made river. "
If you like antiques and reproductions,Insadong is good for shopping for antiques and knick knacks. Also is home to Jogyesa Temple which is a short walk from the shopping street. Lots of small tea houses and restaurants as well
You'll 100% enjoy Insadong,"You're not in Korea yet if you haven't visited this place. Insadong is actually a street (about 1km long?) and you can find many interesting things along the street, from korean's souvenir, hanbok (Korea's traditional costumes) rental, delicious foods (!!) etc etc. Insadong is all about Korean culture, you'll feel so Korea-ish once you visit this place. If you're trying to find souvenirs, there are many options from the cheap one till the expensive one. But dont forget to bargain. The sellers here are sooo nice and sometimes they'll ask you with your mother-language once you told them where do you come from. Just try to come to random restaurant in this street. I can guarantee that you'll never feel dissapointed with the taste!"
shopping and eating,"what ever your budget to eat or shop, this area has many things to make you come back a few times. many good deals for souvenir shopping and a wide variety of food to tempt your tastebuds"
Not sure what all the fuss was about,Was expecting a little more and perhaps we should have explored the streets a little more but basically a tourist street selling a little more cultural (middle class) gifts.
Nice Shopping Place,Visitors should go here. Got a lot of nice things.Easy to move around by subway. Some its are cheap.
Not so crowded,"I think that you will have a better shopping experience here than in Myeongdong. There are a lot of restaurants,food stalls and gift shops however it is not very crowded as compared to Myeongdong."
Must not miss!,We decided to go to Insadong and walk around leisurely. There are a lot of small shops and food stops to try out as well. Try to visit this neighborhood if you got time to spare. 
A quiet place - Nice!,"I love Insadong, a quieter place than Myeongdong, no rush or crowds. Things are cheaper here, we bought nice haversack bags at 10000₩ near to main road. Walked around Ssamzegil and admired the arts and crafts. Ate the poop shaped pancakes and citron tea, what a wonderful feeling! I just loved the small quiet area of Insadong. The only inconvenient part is that there is no halal food here or praying area and we have to settle for a vegetarian restaurant. Prices are not cheap but they served very delicious korean vegetarian cuisine. A place I will visit again!"
Trendy place to find some trinkets,"This area used to be two villages, In and Sa. Later, they combined and formed the current area. An old gathering spot for artists, this area is a good spot to shop for scrolls or pottery to decorate the interior of your home. There are some tea-tasting establishments here. Traffic is blocked off, but that doesn't stop delivery motorbikes from making their runs through the area."
Tourist Paradise,Many shops offering various merchandise especially art. The main road is closed to vehicles. Similar to Myeongdong shopping area but smaller and offer different items. There is a cat cafe near the southern end.
Place to find nice Korean food and souvenirs,"This place is a must visit area to find Korean souvenirs, as well as some nice Korean food. However, make sure you bargain to get the best price. "
Antique Districts,Shopping and more shopping; Insadong is a combination of new and old products retailers area. Bought a Copper Cup and Saucer here!
art museum,"Many art shops along the endless road with food along the way, we get our souvenir for our friends and relative there. We spent almost half a day there. We also managed to bought the Jeju green tea from there."
"Art, good food and good te",There are a lot of small galleries with restaurants and tea houses in between. It is fun but also can be relaxing (which for Korea it is seldom unless you go out of the city). 
Visit Ssamziegil Mall,"The shopping mall has spiral-ramp like stairways. Shops selling different kinds of things, making it fun to mingle and window-shop. Insadong is accessible via Anguk station or Jonggak station. Worth a visit."
Favourite spot in Seoul - hands down!,"This place is nothing short than amazing. Many cute little shops selling hand-made stuff, great food, locals hanging out. I loved it."
Trendy and traditional,"Best of traditional Korean gifts, art and crafts along with historical spots and trendy shops and boutiques. You can also get the best dumplings in the city!!!"
Great Fun for Tourists,"As Korean-American who still visits Seoul 12-15 times a year, I highly recommend spending a leisurely afternoon walking around this area. Insadong used to be area famous for art dealers and galleries where all the top Korean painters displayed their work. But, the top galleries such as Hyundai have moved out to more modern and larger spaces of their own so only few galleries remain. I recall Insadong also as a home to couple of well known Korean restaurants but they have also moved out years ago. Now Insadong is a tourist attraction neighborhood filled with local restaurants, some galleries (not the top tiers ones) and souvenir vendors. I prefer to take my foreign guests there on Sundays when the main street that runs right across Insadong is closed to cars and many street vendors come out and walking is much more fun. I urge you to go into narrow streets - these narrow streets are difficult to find nowadays in modern Seoul but I love walking through them here as they brings back memories of my childhood. Do not worry about getting lost in these streets as they are all short distance and all loop back into the main road . The restaurants and coffee and tea shops in these narrow streets are more fun I think than the ones on the main street. I can not think of better place to buy souvenir for your friends back home and to get a taste of what Seoul used to be like 50 years ago. I would place this area as one of top 5 places to visit in Seoul - especially if you happen to be there on Sunday. P.S. Even if you are visiting solo, this is safe and still fun place to visit."
Shopping street full of interesting things!,Even if you are not going to buy anything simply take a walk to this street and don't miss the Ssamji-gil mall.Here you will find some very good restaurants and free wifi on the street.
"EXCELLENT shopping & sight seeing, great way to experience the local culture! ","EXCELLENT shopping & sight seeing, great way to experience the local culture! There is so much to see & do! You can get a fish pedicure at Dr. Fish located at 2F Insadong!"
Souvenir gallore!!,"For anyone who wants to buy souvenirs, this is the place. This is a long street completed with some side streets of shops dedicated only for souvenirs and novelties. Of course there is food shops."
A place to visit for local style.q,a place with it own history. go into the small streets an d treat yourself to the cafes. if you are looking for korean tourist items buy it here.. 
Good place for eat traditional foods,This place is good to feel the old style of Korea and can buy many traditional items. There are many street foods too.
Good place for seeing old items,This place you can see the old items which Korean used to use it. There are also many good street foods.
Very interesting place. Good for an afternoon wonder,"We came here twice. Once to wonder around the small lanes to the gift shops of traditional gifts of handmade paper, weaved bags, paint brushes and traditional tea houses. The jujube was very rich and delicious that we came back a second time to buy the jujube sauce back home!"
Interesting and Tourist Friendly,"Similar to a lot of streets like this, there was a huge assortment of shops. What made this interesting were the side streets with many small restaurants and shops. I found a number of fun places to snack on the arterial roads, and a nice place to have a set menu lunch. The location is very tourist friendly. Also a great place for souvenirs."
"If you have not time, you will not miss much","If you have not time, you will not miss much...Touristic shops with a lot of non-local items... Didn't bought anything."
Nice walk - historic ,"Tourist area with many art, handicraft n local stuff. Reasonable crowded even though it was a weekday. Nice walk to Savour local delights n feel of an old town. Cafes n eateries for those who needed a rest. "
Great for sightseeing and buying local souvenirs,"The street is filled with shops, restaurants, and street foods. The shops sell souvenirs and traditional items. Recommended for tourist."
Great for a stroll and a few souvenirs,"Love Insadong, will always go for a stroll here if I have a chance. Don't bother to go to a proper restaurant - just have a chicken skewer from a cart at the end of the street. Close to a lot of other attractions: 2 palaces and a temple, great shopping and many places to duck into. Several metro stations nearby also."
Nice stroll,Shops on both sides of a street meant for casual strolling. Can buy local souvenirs here. Quite nice but nothing memorable. 
Fun shopping!,Great for wandering and souvenirs. Also little authentic places to duck in for food. Worth a trip! You can do this and Gyeongbokgung Palace together easily
Love this place!,Lots of awesome hidden restaurants and drinking places. Great for artsy people too. I was there for 4 nights in total of my 9 day trip.
A place where cultural stuff meets (I was told),"Was just a street with shops by the side of the road with tourist stuff and cultural stuff.Some shops are interesting, some... you will just walk pass.Nothing to scream about actually but where since I was in Korea, mind as well 'complete' it."
Interesting place,"Been there a couple of time. Interesting place, hidden restaurant served fantastic Korean dishes. Some hidden market as well. interesting shopping place."
love the shop designs in this area,Insadong is a heaven for those who love arts & craft. All the shops and cafes here are housed in a small shops along the alley. it looks like you were taken back in time strolling here. most of the shops here sells souvenirs and crafty stuffs. 
traditional meet with modern live,"on seoul, i was stay on seodaemun. from my hotel i got some information about Seoul Tourism program is Insadong. by bus its just 20 minutes. we can see more traditional life style and culture from Korean Hystory and goes with group of friends. Traditional resto and cullinary, and we will enjoy to walking around and gettin rest on traditional tea hous with our friends. souvenirs shop on street and many tourist have enjoy to take many picture of landmark and landscape views."
Like to walk down this street anytime,"This is a street which I like to walk along leisurely just to look at the arts and craft or stop to get some food and snack. Even during Autumn the atmosphere is great. We have some shopping , tea and lunch. Look at the lccal handicraft, the specialty store. Many tourist come around this street, "
one of my fav streets in Seoul,"so many restaurants, so many coffee shops... you need not to eat for a week before coming here, if you are the type that wants to try it all ^^"
Market Walk,Our Hotel Receptionist asked us to walk down this street.. It's full of traditional and modern shopping and many restaurants and street side food.. including Indian Cuisine.. Recommended for all tourists...
Dinner time,"Insadong is my favourite hangout whenever I visit Seoul. I enjoy very much the traditional Korean buffet spread from the restaurant there and seeing the display of all so colourful local handicrafts. It is not confusing and easy to walk the stretch within Insadong itself. For those looking to buy some souvenirs, Insadong is one of the best place to do so. A good half a day is needed if you wish to have lunch or dinner and tea there. I find it less crowded there compared to other places and it is really good for those who are into art and craft, pottery and paint brushes etc.."
Shopping street for knick knack lover,"Personally I think insadong shopping street is best place to look for artsy knick knack for home or gift. Ssamziegil ( a small mall) houses individual seller selling hand made products ranging from fashion to accesory to art.There are also korean restaurant, tea house (with nice garden) or chic cafe in this area.Come early, most shops close by 830/9pm"
brand new visit to old Korea,"i visited several times for study in old GyoungGi High school in the area and for this opportunity i came to visit and for Korean Catholic historic sites in the vicinity, and wow for my surprise the places were neat and the people were modest and kind in that you virtually needed no tour guide but then at the same time if you want your 2hour visit to Insa dong you will come to know the present Koean old values and few souveniours for your tour at heart of the city."
So interesting moving along old residential area!,"Insadong was easily accessible by Seoul Metro. And the area gets so busy during weekends with both locals and many tourists. So interesting moving along old residential area with new modern buildings and...just look up, you'll find lots of interesting cafes and restaurants around."
Good for tourists... ,Worth going if you're a tourist in Seoul. Good eats and tea houses. Definitely a tourist trap so dont buy a ton of stuff here. There are better deals to be found across Seoul. 
Great area to stay,We spent a week staying here. Can't go wrong. Great food. Close to many attractions and easy to get around. Just pick a restaurant that looks intriguing and the good is bound to be amazing. 
Amazing street,A very cultural street filled with traditional and modern arts... lots of street food as well. Some great restaurants too.
Arty street ,"I've stayed over a year next to insadong now, and it's always entertaining to stay next to an art street. Lots of fun things happening there at any time. Always good for a walk through if you've got time on your hands.Although it's a tourist attraction, advise to buy stuff elsewhere or at least check prices elsewhere and not have insadong as the first choice for buy. Amethyst and jewellery is quite expensive compared to many other places and countries. Good place to pick up curios and gifts for loved ones which are typically korean. "
Tradition Street,"If you wanna experience Korea, you should visit this place. Located in the middle of old town. Many things to see and enjoy. Souveniors can be purchased!"
All of the touristy stuff in one place,"I guess for souvenirs and exploring local street food/crafts, Insadong is a great place to go, especially if you're staying central. We stayed around Hongdae so we felt like most of the stuff Insadong had to offer was available in a more cheap and authentic way over there. "
A must visit place ,Insadong is really nice place to hangout. There are alot of cafes here. It's not crowded like Myeongdong if you want to shop.
"Very touristic, not really worth it","I presume that this used to be a cultural and artistic area but sadly it's now been overrun with junky tourist shops selling plastic-wrapped trinkets and endless souvenirs. To be fair, there are still gems amongst the tat - a few shops selling handmade paper, a couple of independent stationery stores. And the art available there is attractive, but you don't need to look too closely to see that it's mass-produced.I found Bukchon Village, a little further north, to be far more atmospheric and charming. And if you can get there, the Art Street in Gwangju, a city a few hours south of Seoul, is delightful, and presumably what Insadong used to look like, and wishes it still did.I walked up and down Insadong-gil a couple of times during my stay under the assumption that I'd missed the good bits, but I never found them!"
Great place to find souvenirs,This place has a lot of small shops and restaurants. If you are looking for souvenirs you will find something for everyone. I recommend personalized stamps as souvenirs which they will make for you in less than 30 min. Stamps cost around $35 to $100 which is very reasonable for one of a kind stamps.
Love the Vibe,"A nice place to walk around. Lots of shops, from souvenir, clothes, home decors and accessories to beauty care. Restaurants of all kinds are aplenty too. Museums are likewise to found a few buildings. Insadong is a great place to admire the architecture, both old and new."
a lovely place to wander around..,met friends and hung out for the evening... had a great time.. nice places to eat..a dn lots of places to take pictures
right at the heart of seoul,we stayed at insadong(insadong crown hotel) and felt at ease with the place. we arrived quite late at night and was able to have late dinner because of the foodshops around. very accessible to the different subway lines passing thru it. but most of our stops were at jongno sam (3) or anguk station. 
Tired of many people in Myeongdong? Visit Insadong.,PROS: Not that touristy compared to Myeongdong. A lot of beautiful and cheap shops present. You can bargain too. Close to city center and Palaces.CONS: Noisy Turkish Ice Cream Seller! Shut up Dude!LOCATION: 5/5PRICE: 5/5HOSPITALITY: 4/5ATTRACTIONS: 4/5
Handcraft shops and souvenirs,"Not cheap, but some very beautiful traditional earthenware cups and other kitchen and house ware. Nice relaxed neighborhood."
The Heart and Soul of Seoul,"We visited the Insadong District of Seoul two different times on a recent visit to Seoul. It truly is the 'heart and soul' of Seoul for many reasons. One is that it is really such a quaint area to walk around. Take the time to get away from the main thorough (which is actually pretty cool in itself) to explore the side streets. These are very narrow and contain many small restaurants, shops and Korean guest houses. It's also where the residents of Insadong live. Simply fun to wander through. Then, back on the main thoroughfare, are the many small shops that my wife enjoyed browsing through. Here you can buy handmade items (from South Korea) to take home with you as gifts for family and friends. The street food is also awesome in Insadong. Check it out. Very tasty! But my main reason for coming to Insadong was because this is where many South Koreans come to shop and eat. And it's not so insanely crowded as areas such as the Myeongdong district can be. Check out Insadong. You will be pleased that you did."
"A place to learn a bit more about Korean traditional craft, art and culture","I came here specially to look for hanji (handmade Korean paper), and there are several shops here that sell it. There were three shops that stood out for me. One is on the 2nd floor opposite Starbucks. Another one is at the end of the main Insadong road (he has reams of paper displayed outside his shop), and there's a Hanji paper artist in one of the side lanes who also uses hanji to create containers, vases etc. Unfortunately, his shop was closed when I visited on Sunday.There are also lots of other things that you can check out here. Traditional tea shops to sample Korean tea, shops to buy tea and tea making paraphernalia. There's the usual touristy souvenirs as are ceramics like celadon and other traditional Korean fine china/porcelain. I visited one craftsman who had a corner shop and sold cups, incense holders which also doubled as flower holders. A selection of his work featured Korean housescapes - tea cups, coffee mugs, long plates. They were very affordable, and made good gifts. But it is also good to browse around first, because the prices amongst shops can vary drastically for similar products. A tea filter and pot set cost 28000 KW at one shop, and another one further down was asking for 35000 KW. There's the multi-storey Ssamziegil shopping complex in the heart of Insadong. Here you find craft with a mix of the new and the traditional. The shops are connected by a walkway that winds its way to the top. You also have a choice of stairwells to climb up or down to the level you want to reach.It's a bit touristy, but also fun as the place comes alive with Friday night culture performances, weekend dance and singing performances. At the end of the street (closer to the Jongno 3 area) are lots of carts selling trinkets, food. And if you're keen on handmade books, there's a gentleman with a cart of handmade books. You can catch him making them on the premises.On both sides of the Insadong area, you can catch some noteworthy attractions. There's Jogyesa, an impressive Buddhist temple and Unhyeongung Palace, once the private residence of Joseon royalty. Both attractions are free to the public.Insadong is a good place to spend a few hours to absorb the culture of Korea."
for those who love street food and wanted to buy back some souvenir this is the right place for u,i was here with other tour group which i booked online for the tour. and cant really observed what is interesting there as we are rushed to get into the bus to another place. mostly the store are along the street and mostly are selling souvenir (variety kind of thing). and i saw quite numerous of people selling street food. 
Worth a walk through,Lots of traditional crafts to see & shop. Lovely items from ceramic bowls to handmade earrings. Some great places to eat on the side streets as well!
"Coffee shops, artsy craft stores and museums",I loved the Insadong/Bukchon/Samcheong Dong area. It's a more unique shopping experience and far from the manic manic crowds of Myeongdong (near the Lotte Department Store) where the cacophony of vendors enthusiastically peddling their wares to chinese tourists in mandarin was simply tiring. The Insadong/Bukchon/Samcheong Dong area in contrast is lined by trees and the shops maintained the architectural gems of the previous structures that house them. Beautiful wooden roofs in that traditional sweeping design prolific to the period of their construction (i.e. 600 years ago). There are plenty of cafes/trendy independent stores/churros (the latest craze i guess?) to weave in and out of. 
Nice to walkabout,Nice place to hangout with partner or friends. More like a Hipster place. Some souvenirs seem over priced but generally a good selection 
Lots of interesting shops,"Liked the shopping in this street and many places to eat. Particularly enjoyed the pancake that we had, fresh and delicious. Definitely worth a visit."
Art street,This is the place where Seoul artists display and sell their arts. Souvenirs are also quite cheap here
Another busy area in Seoul with plenty to keep your eyes busy,"Insa-dong is another of Seoul's enjoyable neighbourhoods filled with shopping, dinning and other forms of light entertainment. Here you find more traditional buildings and shops dealing in traditional Korean goods compared to areas like Myeong-dong where retail shopping is more prevalent. We enjoyed walking the main street in Insa-dong, peeking into the handcraft shops, galleries, souvenir stores, mixed in and occasional small museums like the Kimchee museum and small eateries. There are a few historical attractions like the Jogyesa Temple, nearby Unhyeonggung Palace and Tapgol Park. Seems there is a bit of something for everyone in Insa-dong. One of the fun things to do in Insa-dong, is to simply take a small street and walk for a while. You'd be surprised how many restaurants and little shops continue to pop up as you walk down these side lanes in Insa-dong. While we didn't eat at any of these little places, there are likely some real gems here. Overall, we enjoyed spending time in Insa-dong. It is another photogenic and busy area with plenty to keep your eyes occupied for a few hours. It is well worth including a bit of time here during trips to Seoul."
Don't miss this microcosm of life in Seoul! Great street food!,"We had only a couple of hours to explore and hope to return someday to really enjoy this street teeming with local life. On Sundays, the street is closed to vehicles and becomes a huge walking mall lined with shops and restaurants. There are buskers performing and street vendors with great Korean foods and crafts. We watched Dragon Beard Candy get made - obviously a show put on for tourists but fun to see. We wandered into Ssamziegil and bought Poop Bread - yep! Buttery dough filled with chocolate and shaped in the form of... well - you can guess. It's a very popular Korean snack and delicious. I would've been scared to try it but the long line waiting to purchase them convinced me it was worth at least one bite. If you have time for only a few sites in Seoul, visit a palace and Insadong. You'll feel quite satisfied."
Seriously cool shopping,"Even with obvious tchotcke shops, if your style of shopping has nothing to do with ginormous malls, this place is for you. Though you won't find bargains, per se, you can find lots of beautiful, hand-crafted and unusual things for yourself and friends who deserve something unique. There's also 2Cats Cafe, with lovely owners, and some street food."
Nice Place!,"Nice place for shopping,eating. You can find many stuffs here, you can buy a lots soveniour,eat local food.There is traditional performance during weekend. Nah, it's free.!"
popular place to visit for souveniers and other things,"went my second time here to go around in the small streets and to look at all people walking around , and of course there is lot of foodplaces where you can eat"
Traditional street ,"Here can get those transitional thing like wood mask , jade , food and must try Teh house . Omija teh and red bean jujube teh and transitional Korea snack .. But the price is like 18,000 per set u get 2 teh n 1 Korea cake . "
Pulsing and colourful cultural spot,"Love visiting Insadong as it is always busy, colourful and full of life. Never a dull moment as you browse through the small shops selling local art & craft, clothings, shoes, souvenirs. Tonnes of cafes, restaurants, tea houses to choose from. Some are not cheap as they can spot a tourist miles away.The area is not too large but one can spend a couple of hours here especially if you like taking photographs."
Art Scene,Insadong is alive with art scene. A few buskers are there to entertain visitors. There are many shops selling all kinds of things. You can watch the world go by by sipping your favourite coffee at the many cafes here. There is also a street where there are many shops selling souvenirs at reasonable prices.
Traditional Crafts and retail shopping paradise!,Every visitor to Seoul should take the metro or a taxi to Insadong. Here is where you will find traditional crafts and also Korean souvenirs and other retail opportunities. The street runs about 8 blocks or so. Many good traditional Korea restaurants are located in the side streets off Insadong Street. Plan to spend at least 2-3 hours wondering through all the stores and trying some of the street food that is available.
Souvenir shops,"Souvenir shops are the majority in this street and restaurants preparing local food as well. Here you can try local traditional clothes and forms, it is interesting to try. "
Lovely place,Nice place to be with a friend and give some time with yourself. Lovely place good environment.What else?
Ok Market,I think this place is overrated. It is famous for antique pieces but they are quite expensive. Food stalls are limited as compared to other markets in Seoul.
Great trendy place,"This was a very entertaining place to walk around.Many shops of a large variety, a good feel of the place, younger and older people walking the streets, and just a vibrant, exciting atmosphere."
A walk through Insadong...,"My husband and I started from the top (we walked from the Bukchon area) and got there about 6pm. We were able to catch a small parade of sorts on the way so that was a treat too. Insadong is a great place to purchase all the souvenirs (keychains, magnets, bells, traditional purses/pouches, korean utensils, etc) Prices are better than the spuvenirs found in Myeongdong. More variety as well. Highly recommend a visit here! Most stores i believe close at 8pm so be sure to be early :-) "
excellent shopping street,"it is such a paradise. Walking slowly on the old pebbled street, enjoying the quaint shops along the street.art galleries, hand made items, small restaurant, souvenirs shop and cosmetic shopping heaven.can't ask for a better place to go. glad that i visited this place."
"So charming and a great place to stroll, shop for gifts, and eat a Korean meal (and try to rice wine!)",We really found this pedestrian area to be so charming and had our best dining experience here. We saw some beautiful cultural show on the pedestrian street (in period costumes doing some re-creation of some martial arts fighting) and then wandered the streets and side streets on the pedestrian street to find some great places to eat Korean food. It is a must see area on your trip to Seoul for sure. Easily reached from either end via subway.
A taste of old Korea,"I had been to Seoul several times wen one of my local friends took me to Insadong. In the heart of this modern city there is a small section that is still what Korea was. You can buy foods from street vendors, shop in smaller independent shops, see tradition and culture while enjoying art, coffee, tea and soaking in A Seoul from the past. I will go back and urge you to take in this amazing street."
My favorite place in Seoul,"My favorite place in Seoul so far. I always fancy going to places like these where streets are lined up with small art galleries, souvenir shops, cafes, street performers, etc. Insadong-gil (the main street) is a popular destination among tourists with its cobblestone walkways lined with trees wrapped in colorful threads and concrete benches with flowering plants. One can easily spend a whole day just exploring the place and trying the various street food displayed along the alleyways. Just like any other stuff in Seoul, I find it most of the items pricey as compared to other Asian countries. But that was expected. Most of the items are priced at an average of KRW10,000 (USD8.50), street food at about USD4.50. If you are patient enough, you can find stalls that sell small souvenirs at a cheaper price. Haggling, for some reason, is not encouraged. This is definitely a must-see in Seoul. Highly recommended."
Beautiful Tea Museum,Disappointing visit to the Beautiful Tea Museum. Very difficult to locate it; very out of the way for tourists. The waitresses could hardly speak English n not very friendly. Also very expensive. Would not recommend to anyone unless u are crazy about exotic tea n willing to pay exorbitant price.
shopping place,"Go to ssamsagiel.. and go to this one shop.. enter this shop, the owner will say ""all bag at 10,000won"". and really shop bags here!"
Korean street,"Everything is completely in Korean. Lots of people, lots of small shops with traditional book marks, clothing etc."
Cultural heritage,"Insadong is a cultural area in which you can have all kinds of souveniers from Korea, and special korean teas. It is mandatory to go there if you are in Seoul. "
Prices are the best for souvenir shopping,"Compared to Dongdaemun, the souvenir prices were a few won cheaper in Insadong. However, there is very little bargaining here. Most won't even consider budging from their set price. It is a little difficult to find. We found it by accident. Their alleys have some great food joints. We went around here as part of a food tour."
Oh how i love this place,"Insadong, people, has been my favorit market in Seoul. I love the vibe. There are lots of store selling unique stuffs here and of course yummy food.I do love this place"
The Arty side of Seoul,Insadong district is an arty area of Séoul which you can combine after your visit to Gyengbokgung Palace as its just 5 to10 Mons walk away. The have some good shops but Souvenirs are cheaper elsewhere. There is one particular shop called Arirang which has good quality souvenirs for a very good less price compared to other shops with good selection of souvenirs
Enjoyable,"Wonderful trinkets and handmade items of all kinds made this a fun experience for us. lots of things to choose from, for all ages. Close to Anguk station."
Pretty & Interesting ,An arty pedestrian street obviously designed for shoppers and tourists. I stumbled upon it by accident. Lots of art and craft shops. I had an excellent in a traditional Korean restaurant on the Main Street. Worth checking out. 
Traditional House,Korean traditional house that is still remaining in Korea is located here in Insadong Korea. Have a visit here and wear hanbok
free tour,there is a free tour so you can go an emblematic and fun places to visit..i had to stay in incheon airport for quite some time o booked the tour and we did a culinary feast..!!
"If you love art, food, coffee and don't mind crowds - Insadong is a beautiful way to spend the day","Thoroughly enjoyed walking through this area, particularly the art galleries. There were many tea houses which all looked very inviting. I didn't try a tea house, but did sip some delicious honey & ginger tea from one of the side stalls, accompanied with a strawberry filled traditional rice cake - yum!!! There are too many galleries to see in one day. Definitely put it on your list if you are artsy & like food/coffee/tea/desserts/ people watching."
Mixing the traditional and trendiness,"Really like this place, as with traditional architecture but combining with cool new fashionable small shops. Not big brands nor luxury brands, just local small neighborhood stores. And it is not busy and super noisy area. very nice, esp around 1030-12noon"
Arty Crafty souvenir area,"Interesting ""arty"" side of the city. Lots of restaurants, street stalls, art & craft gift shops. However, beware, many are vastly over priced.I saw identical items for sale in other parts of town at half the price of the Insadong shops- so be ware."
Good place to eat and shopping,"in this place you can find many small store sell souvenir, small thing, korean cosmetic, food place to hang out and eat, with lots of option (korean, chinese, western).The food and souvenir with average price..overall good place when you come to seoul"
Great place to buy souveniers,"Rows and rows of little shops selling interesting art and souvenirs. Its a great place to spend a few hours just browsing and shopping. Near to Samcheongdong, which has amazing cafes serving delicious coffee, waffles and ice cream. I would recommend café hopping at Samcheongdong, and walking off all those calories at Insadong after."
"Must do in Seoul, nice area and many small shops and coffee's","Must do in Seoul, nice area and many small shops and coffee's in the area. Local residence are still living there so every building looks different but still very traditional."
Great any time of day,"I visited Insadong twice on my stay in Seoul. Once by accident when I was aimlessly wondering the streets of Seoul and i slowly gravitated towards Insadong as it is an attractive place, the other because I was recommended it. I was amused to find that the place I went to and had such a nice time and regrettably didn't know where it was, was actually Insadong.The Main Street holds the majority of the rabble, and there are a bunch of little side streets with interesting hints hiding down them. Whilst a lot of the shops sell the same thing, there are some wonderful artisanal shops and galleries where the artist is busy working away in their latest piece. There are plenty of restaurants and bars, just head down any side street. At the higher end of Insadong street on the right, there will be a courtyard looking thing open up. This to me was the real treasure. Head in and check out this complex. Up the stairs on the right as you enter, the floors spiral up until you reach the top. There are wonderful shops of craft and fashion all the way up, and it finishes in what I gather to be called he poop cafe. It was nice, in spite of the ""cutely designed"" poops. Take your time and amble. A nice way to spend a good few hours. "
Very pretty,Insa dong is pretty and has masses of shops.Some quaint and interesting buildings to see. exactly as it says in anything you read online. We just walked around it. Theres loads of food and coffee places. And it wasn't too busy!
cute little traditional / arts & crafts area,It's a cute little area with some traditional / arts & crafts shops. We walked around the area on a sunday afternoon and it was very interesting to see the street acts. The lunch we had in the area was also very good. 
perfect location for chilling,Really recommend for traditional souvenir shopping and art lover person. Nice street with unique shop!!
Hilly district,It falls enroute seoul tower and tour bus has a stop here Well connected by metro n bus It is an upmarket township on the tiny mountain and gives the feeling of a hill station A lot of shops food outlets and designer clothes are availableA complete different experience
Many stores,This place is like an outdoor swap meet. So many places snd shops. I brought pretty hanbok postcards here for a reasonable price. Again parking is verygard to find. Take the subway here
Cultural Old Town ,"Being a recommended place to visit, we made our way there on sunday, getting there was fairly easy, alight at Angguk station and exit at gate 6. Walk up the stairs about 150 metres turn to the left, you will find Insidong. A number of shops selling souvenirs, paintings, coffees shops and restaurants. Very laid back and less stressful then in Myeongdong, old buildings lining the street and alley filled with restaurants. At one of the restaurants where we had lunch, it was really an old building with its internal wooden structure still in tact, we had to sit on the floor where lunch was served on a low table.I like Insadong, its laid back atmosphere and no pressure from sales girls selling cosmetics as in Myeongdong. In fact we went there again the next day."
Over priced tourist trap,Do not buy any souvenir item from Isadong. The items are grossly overpriced many times over. I bought a nail cutter souvenir at 5000 won (USD4.5). I had later bought another 10 (same item) at 7000 won from Dongdaemun.Isadong is a tourist trap and a big ripoff. It is ok just to walk around. 
Visit to Insadong on 4th Oct 2015,One of the must visit spots in Seoul for tourists. The narrow streets and myriad of street stores sell a variety of Korean products and food for visitors to purchase. It is also the place to purchase souvenirs and gifts for family and friends back home. The area is crowded with tourists and be prepared to squeeze yourself through the narrow streets to move around the place.
One of my favorite places in Seoul,"The scents, sights, shopping, people watching, art, culture, architecture, down to the stone lined streets take you to a place that was much closer to what Seoul was like before the miracle on the Han. "
Our Fraser Suites hotel was right in the middle of this interesting area. Never got bored. Antiques galore!,So many different places to eat. The best Korean BBQ was right in our hotel building. Quite expensive but well worth it for the quality of the meat. 
Fun area - great tourist shopping area,"Insadong was the first place I saw when i arrived, as my first hotel was in this area. It was a fun intro to the city - lots of local eateries and tourist shops. It always had lots of people, both tourists and locals. People very friendly and helpful and always felt safe here. Great for basic souvenir shopping."
Good place to kill some time,Street vendors galore selling the latest in tacky trinkets and souvenirs as well as street food. There's also a few restaurants dotted about. Worth spending an afternoon there- though in heavy rain the street became rather flooded! Go when it's dry.
Nice area,"Nice area, a definite 'have to check it out' while here, but I personally expected a bit more. Small shops and restaurants are good though."
Relaxing,"After all the sight-seeing we did, this area was a welcome change of pace. There are a lot of souvenir shops, tea shops, restaurants, etcetera, but what struck me most is the relaxing atmosphere. We had a good time and bought some nice souvenirs."
Worth a visit,I walked around here during the day and also in the evening. Seems better to go in the evening. It's worth a visit as I said but not too exciting.
"this is a place that u can buy a lot souvenir for you, families, friends, etc.. Try to bargain..","Try to bargain, this is a place that you can buy a alot souvenirs from Korea. There's a restaurant in alley, it has delicious pork belly hahahaha 30.000 won for 2 people"
Shopping that's doesn't stress you out!,I walked here from my hotel in Myongdong. Stop by the tourist booth at the beginning of the street for a map of the neighborhood. One of my favorite places was Ssamziegil with lots of cool and unique stores. I liked the one on the ground floor with dog and cat designs on things. This is also the place with the bathrooms! There are also the ubiquitous food vendors lining the street which I hear is closed to traffic on Sunday's. On the narrow side streets are some places to have tea.
Very nice!,I would recommend walking aroud for a few hours. Lots of quaint shops and souvenirs. Interesting food stalls as well. 
Fun Fun Fun!,"This is a shopping district, the street food is amazing. We even had Capri Sun's for adults (cocktails in a ziplock bag with a straw). It's very crowded but at the end of the street there is a park you should not miss. Cross the street to the left and go in the gates, it's very old and very cultural. "
"Anguk Station, Exit #6!","Been to Seoul twice and I went back to InsaDong a number of times during each trip. I just LOVE this place. You can buy souvenirs for almost everyone in your family or friends here. Great restaurants too! One restaurant that I went back to on my second trip is Gogung, which is located at the basement of Ssamziegil (a shopping center located in InsaDong). Explore the shops and galleries. Don't get disheartened if you don't get bargains or deals on your first shop. There's always one shop that would be more than willing to do business with you and show you enough patience. :)"
"Bit touristic, but best place to buy souvenirs","Bit touristic, but best place to buy souvenirs in Seoul. In some shops you can try bargaining to reach a better price! Also check on the origin of the goods if you want to buy Made in Korea stuff, as many may come from China!"
Great shopping,Wide variety of shops. Staff seemed pretty helpful throughout.Easy metro access. Humming and vibrant
Good place to experience some traditional taste in Seoul,"Seoul is a capital of S. Korea and a very busy/modern city. But if you want to enjoy some traditional taste in the city, you can go to this area. This place does not entirely consist of traditional buildings, but it has some feel to it. Good mix of traditional and modern elements"
Upmarket tiny Korean shops,"So many many little shops where the owner designed the products sold. Clothing, bags, haberdashery, jewellery, ornaments...etc.. Many little art galleries. The main street is a walking mall and has a helpful information booth at the north end. The hop-on bus has a stop there. Its amazing how many small streets and lanes are around there. So many eateries and cafes."
Nice Place to find good and cozy restaurant and buying souvenir,"We went there by Taxi from Gangnam, so many restaurant and shops. It is a really nice place to go when you re in Seoul"
Vintage place,"You can find traditional things you never find out anywhere. So many souvenir shop, clothes, bags, and vintage and unique things in insadong, i like that i was there "
A wonderful place !,"Hundreds of little shops carrying all kinds of trinkets and artwork, souvenirs and whatnot. Left and right into the alleys are all kinds of small restaurants and other fun stuff. A lot of tourists of course, but a place like this is nothing without them. A must visit if in Seoul. "
Fun and worth exploring for souvenirs,"Dig deep--walk back to the center of the district for better deals and fewer cheesy ""Korean"" souvenirs from China. The fabric store does beautiful work and offers finished pieces, and the calligraphy shops are lovely. I was also really happy to find the sort of ""K-pop"" stationery store in the center--lots of fun, modern items that make for pretty good souvenirs. Salespeople are far more involved with their customers than one usually experiences in the US--one woman demonstrated her massage/heating pad item by showing me how great it felt to get sort of smacked on the shoulder with it! But it was not nearly as intimidating as many international market districts--this is a credit-card/Westerner-friendly kind of place. "
"If you love art, you'll love this place","Interesting pieces of art and crafts. We bought some nice paper wrappers, fans, wood art, bookmarks. They're all beautiful. "
Too Touristy!,Insadong is just like the pictures. I don't mind touristy places and events but I guess I have my limits and this place was one of them. There is certain about of charm to some tourist places in the fact that it is a tourist destination but here it was just too commercial and everything was over priced. Hoards are unavoidable there I went on a Thursday. Drop by if your near but it's really nothing special. 
Small shops and souvenirs,"The Main Street of this district is closed for cars, so nice to walk. This area is interesting for doing small souvenir shopping and walk around. Not super."
Good for an afternoon stroll,"This area is great for an afternoon stroll of souvenir shopping and people watching. There brick and mortar stores have the antiques, but there are lots of stalls selling cheaper trinkets and what you expect to find in an outdoor market. If you're hungry, head down the alleys and you'll find a plethora of dining options."
Nice shopping street,opposite Jogesa Temple. Nice shopping street. full with artisan and handmade goods. You can rent Hanbok to dress and shopping around.
Beautiful place,This is an street where you can find very nice and typical craft of Corea and teas. You'll not get dissapointed. And is a safe place.
Our Favorite Area in Seoul,"Charming area with a lot of character, some cobblestone walks. Plenty of pretty pots and plants. Many, many shops...with generally the same merchandise, but it is of quality. Restaurants tucked away on side streets and a few tea houses, too. Very clean. You can spend hours here, like we did. All good!"
A place cannot be missed in Seoul,"This is a place full of Korean traditional culture. Can be reach by Subway line 3 destination Anguk station exit No.6.In Insadong you are able to get great Korea culture souvenirs such as painting, ceramics, folk arts and handicraft. We had a great time exploring the streets and small lanes. We went there twice because we love the food there. You can get great traditional Korean food and Korean traditional desert for tea. The Korean delicious Bibimbap restaurant Gogung is located at the basement of art and crafts centre SSamzigil on the Main Street. On the Main Street you can find another tea restaurant which served great pumpkin tea and Korean traditional deserts. Must try to have your tea at the back of the tea house whereby the ambient are serene. There is another small traditional restaurant walk in the small lane beside the Insa Art Plaza whereby you can try the handmade black beans Tofu on hot pan. The price for dinner there was considered cheap."
geared to tourists,"shops with knickknacks-souvenirs, fast food stall and small restaurants, many bakeries and 'sweets'- specialty stores - most places close immediately ones tourists leave the temple - about 5 pm "
What is the point? ,The street is quite nice and the small shops and cafes are very inviting. Quite nice to have a stroll through the street. The only thing we did not get was: what is the fuzz about this area?
Must visit when you are in Seoul,There are a lot of restaurants and small shops in Insadong where you can spend a day walking around or making handy crafts at Ssamzigil.
Perfect afternoon-night stroll,The location is only 5 minutes walking from Gyeongbokgung Palace. Many shops and eateries along the road. Can be crowded but still manageable. The prices for souvenirs are reasonable. 
Walking Seoul city streets,A great way to spend half a day or so is meandering around Insadong in central Seoul.The closed main street bustles with perhaps too many souvenir shops.There is quite a range of local art shops specialising in Korean art.Cafes and coffee shops abound.There is an interesting 3 level mall built in a circle with ramps leading around the building full of interesting shops.The place is packed on Sundays with locals and tourists.Best time to visit is mid-morning or late afternoon.
Walk thru insadong,A lot's vendors. Great to browse and learn about Korea. Only complaint. No electronic Stores any where. A lots of the same. Coffee shops everywhere.
No for art Lover ,"If you want to see outdated gallery this is the place for you but if you want a very good food and great atmosphere, this is the place for you. Try to avoid the stream and let yourself lost in the many allies, you will find very unique stuff. "
Nice place for art lovers,some really lovely pieces of art at very reasonable price. lots of korean and asian arts can be found there.
Best location in Seoul,"You will find lovely 3-4 stars hotels in this neighbourhood. Best location to visit the palaces, shrines and temples. Plenty of small shops selling souvenirs. Easy access by two metro stations and airport bus. Not to mention the local restaurants offering delicious food day and night. Good also for art and galeries."
Seoul » Jongno-gu » Insa-dong (인사동),"Insa-dong Street is one of the most memorable attractions in Seoul and represents the focal point of Korean traditional culture and crafts. Stores in Insa-dong specialize in a wide variety of goods that can only be purchased or appreciated in Korea: hanbok (traditional clothing), hanji (traditional paper), traditional teas, pottery, and folk crafts.Insa-dong Street stretches over 700 meters between the Anguk-dong Rotary and Tapgol Park (Jongno 2-ga). During the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910), the street was dominated by Dohwawon, a place of study for painters. The area is still a center for the arts, and painters, craftsmen, and art lovers continue to set up shop along the narrow alleys, making it a unique place full of folk crafts, pottery, and paintings. The street offers rich opportunities for visitors to experience Korean traditional culture and arts. Various art events and festivals are regularly held along the street.The information center is located 100m from Ssamjigil, toward Jogyesa Temple. Services offered include interpretation services, tourism information, free internet access, and a program allowing visitors to wear hanbok (traditional Korean clothing). By making a reservation at least a week in advance, visitors can listen to a number of recordings about Korean culture in English, Japanese, and/or Chinese.Operating Hours: 09:30~18:30 (Open all year-round, except for Lunar New Year and Korean Thanksgiving Day)"
A must visit location in Seoul,"Seoul is a large metropolitan city that has so much to see and do. I encourage you to save a few hours for Insadong. It is the perfect place to pick up Korea Specific gifts for family and friends back home. There are galleries, traditional art stores and traditional Korean food. This neighborhood is very close to one of the largest buddhist monasteries in Seoul. Just go, you won't regret it."
Insadong Seoul,The insadong area is definetly recommended. Espacially the Insadong-gil (street) has a lot of Shops with good art and handcraft. It might be a good place to buy a souvenir from Korea. And it is a good starting point to continue towards north to Bukchon Hanok Vilaage or the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Can be easily done on a day. 
Lots of art and handicraft,There are rows of shops that sell art and handicraft. Particularly like their lacquer mother of pearl jewelry boxes. They do sell fans and other stuff as well. To get there take the metro line to Anguk station. 
Beautiful little street ,Go down the small pedestrian lane that runs diagonal to the bigger streets. Lovely souvenir and craft place. Make you sure visit the Jogyesa temple 2 mins away. 
nice place for walking and sightseeing,"Insadong is one of the popular tourist destination. located in the heart of seoul near to gwanghwamun, bukcheon hanok village and samcheongdong make it perfect dstination for day trip. Here you can found lot of cultural and souvenir shop on the sideway. You can also make korean styled name stamp (dojang) here. >.<"
Tradition and culture.,"This is a must-visit for first-timers to Korea/Seoul. It is a little touristy but I regret not coming here on my first trip to Seoul as you do get a sense of the Korean culture when walking through the area. You can get your souvenirs here, or your picture taken in a hanbok (Korean traditional costume), or just sightsee and grab a bite at the food carts. An interesting thing to note that some shop names are in Hangul (look out for Starbucks), not romanized as this is a traditional area after all. There are traditional snacks on sale as well and you can even get a personal seal of your name in Korean (which Koreans use as their signature/thumbprints in contracts in real life). Near the Bukchon Hanok Village as well. There are some moneychangers here, but they tend to be on the second level of the shophouses. "
Nice,You can find korean crafts here.it's not too crowded..It's also near Bukchon hanok village.You can also find some nice coffee shops & street food vendors here..
Not to be missed when in Seoul,A street where you can buy all the skin care that Korea is famous for and with interesting craft and antique shops as well as street snack stalls. 
Souvenirs!,"This is a kind of touristy place, where you can find really awesome gifts for your friends. Don't miss your chance to try a traditional Korean clothing! "
Amazing Insadong,"I really loved Insadong. Yes, there are lots of tourist shops but it is still beautiful and I loved looking in all the little shops and street stalls. "
"Love Gold, street shopping and street food vendors?","Insadong is a mixture of old school plus new school With good metro access, access to a number of parks, palaces and museums, Insadong is a cheap and exciting place to stay in."
Lots of handicraft & homemade stuff in the arty area,"We reached the area late and many places were actually getting ready to close but from what was still in operation, the shops focus on handicraft and the arts such as painting etc. Definitely worth a visit!"
Insadong maru!,"Hello! I'll tell you the good news about Seoul, as a member of 'SHOWUL. First, the meaning of this club is 'Show + Seoul.' It is a student club based on 'Non-profit,' 'Share,' 'Communication,' and 'Be a friend' for foreign travellers who visit Seoul. This time, I'll explain about one place which is called 'Insadong' as known as the street of culture. In this place, most people only know 'Ssamjigil,' but I want to recommend elsewhere, which is 'Insadong Maru.' It is where you can see free concerts that show truly traditional and cultural aspects of Korea and South Korea as a cultural complex. For example, if you make a reservation, you can experience Kimchi-making in the Kimchi museum located on its fourth floor. Also, you can make 'Korean paper' right downstairs. And free performances that can inform us of the traditional culture of Korea have been held regularly every week in the first lobby.In addition to this place, there are also lots of places like 'Insadong' in Seoul. If you visit Seoul for travelling, don't hesitate to contact us to get some help! We're always here to help you."
Great Place to Pick Up Unique Korean Souvenirs at Reasonable Prices,"Insadong is an unusual marketplace alley as it's focused exclusively on the arts and culture of South Korea. You'll find lots of paintings, craftwork and Korean tea merchandise dotted at both sides of the walkway. The interesting bit about this area is that the restaurants are somewhat hidden at the back of the alley. There are a couple of very busy restaurants in those small enclaves and they're usually crowded during lunchtime."
Charming place,"This is my 2nd time in Insadong and it never fails. Shops here sell cute artsy stuffs There are a lot of cafes and restos to choose from.. they have streefoods as well. The vibe here is more relaxed compared to Myeongdong. This is a perfect place to find unique stuffs to give to friends or if you want to have your picture taken in a photobooth wearing hanbok. There are also a lot of things to do there I saw some kids making mugs with clay. Some were painting and designing their own mugs, Some were having their caricatures drawn. I recommend this place for the artsy and laidback type. This is the perfect place to see unique and cute things. I would definitely go back eventhough this was my 2nd time already. "
Shopping area that feels more authentic.,"Insadong begins at its Southern end across from Tapgol Park with a nice plaza. The lively area of Insadong includes not only the main street but also a network of alleys. Surprisingly they all feel safe and offer a bit different atmosphere than the main passage. Little alleys are lined with authentic looking restaurants, small antique stores, craftsmen and artisan workshops. At the Northern end of the Inasadong there is tourist information office. There was a folkloric show depicting historic events."
Korean Art and Handicraft,Eye opening to see the creativity of the Korean artist. Lots of souvenirs and handicraft to choose from. Food store is abundant at generally lower price than other places I had visited. There were parade and street show during Saturday. A sure come back should I visit Seoul again. 
Great Area,"We are staying really close to here and its a lovely area. Lots of little restaurants, bars and cafes also loads of souvenir shops. We love going for a coffee with our dog and watching the world go by."
Afternoon in Insadong," Mom, my husband & I spent the afternoon here. My husband had never been to Korea so this was a great area to see the culture and do a bit of shopping too. Getting a taxi to take us to the main ""entrance"" was very easy, as was getting a taxi to take us back to our hotel. We were able to bargain in a few shops, but most would not. Pricing was still better than Itaewon and I was able to buy several really cute sweaters/tops. "
Shopping and crowds,"This is a great place to shop! The stores have tons of traditional Korean crafts and souvenirs. While there are tons of restaurants serving everything from traditional tea to Starbucks, get a snack at the little street stalls. The downside is the crowds!!! Be prepared...a lot of people come here."
Side Streets!,"Bypass the actual shopping street and go into every small alley way that you find. You will find beautiful, old and good restaurants. "
Street Photography!!,A place where youngsters hangout. If you into photography and especially street photography this is the place you have to visit. It has so many interesting spray painting to capture.We visited this place for a short time during morning hours and were happy we didn’t skip our visit here!
Awesome!,"Similar to other neighborhoods, lots of shopping and lots of restaurants. Be sure to check out the alley shop and restaurants. I found way better food at way better prices!"
Take time to explore the alleys,"Try exploring the side streets, sometimes you get better value. Also almost everything you buy has a negotiable price. Star with 40% asking and move up. If they are not willing to budge smile and say no thank you and move on. There will be another store selling the same thing down the street."
Only if you're into Art,"I am personally not a fan of art, but if you are this a great place to see some traditional things that are made. I did buy a few gifts there for members back home and I'd say the prices are reasonable in most places. There are many food markets there and the whole place is crowded throughout the day. I would only go there if I have to."
We love this place,"We booked a hotel here and had no idea of geographical position but were pleasantly surprised by the area and would recommend to all , great for walks and little alley ways and restaurants etc. and not far from bukchon old traditional village "
Went here for a dojang,"One of my favorite places in Seoul. Great place to eat street vendor snacks-- try a hotteok pancake or dduk (rice cake), have a dojang (name stamp) carved while you wait (stationery addict so I researched it and went to Myung Sin Dang Pilbang), beautiful brass (VERY expensive) as well as authentic (NOT Chinese!) celadon stores. "
Souvenirs Galore,Don't bother trying to shop for souvenirs anywhere else in Seoul. this is the place. plenty on offer and for VERY REASONABLE PRICES. I highly recommend a walk down this street. plenty of great food options. look out for the street bar with cheap cocktails :) 
"Great place to just be ""Touristy""","This place is just fun to go to if you want to feel the Seoul crowd while shopping. Lots of snacks, shopping, art stores, etc. And if you go, don't miss the young people making the Korean candy in their little stands. It's worth the 10 minutes total to watch their performance and eat the candy."
Insadong- the place where you feel the joy!,Loved this street so much..A lot of people there...mostly young girls and guys..who give so nice atmosphere to this place. we had nice walk there..bought a lot of souvenirs ..and had a nice dinner in one of the restaurants!
Interesting Shopping,"Located in the Jongno area of Seoul, this an interesting shopping area. Go here to spend an afternoon or evening browsing through the interesting shops, many with beautiful clothing, pottery, souveneers, etc. There are also wonderful coffee and tea houses. "
"Great place for souvenirs, dining and having a stroll around.",Hundreds of little shops and stalls offering a vast collection of souvenirs and art products. If you tastes are musical instruments then there are many shops with a good range of products. This area is near the JONGNO 3 (Sam)-gu - exit 3. It's worth a visit.
Good Art Steet,"Only been there for half days, but you will not be regret. This is a best place which you can slow down your steps and enjoy the art and the culture of Korea, If you have time, please go to any 2/F coffee shops and sit down to relax with a cup of tea or coffee. "
Great way to spend an afternoon.,Insadong is a great area of Seoul for a tourist to visit. You can find many souvenirs to bring home. There are also many art galleries and attractions for locals as well. It's easy to access on line 3. There are plenty of authentic Korean restaurants to sample.
Great place to stay,Such a great place to stay! You can walk down from your hotel and have shopping and food choices galore. 
"A touristy souvenier, tea house and restaurant area","This is definitely a pleasant stroll. It is Seoul on a human scale and, except for an occasional vehicle, a pedestrian street.But let’s call it what it is: It’s a tourist zone (I wouldn’t call it a tourist trap), where you can find souvenirs and trinkets for yourselves, friends or relatives. It does have its share of genuine crafts stores as well, however. It is also chock full of restaurants and tea houses.Personally, I found the prices generally higher here than in the less touristy sections of the city. But if you are seeing Seoul on a tight schedule, this is the place where you can kill several birds with one stone. It is possible to leave this district and claim to have sipped tea in a traditional tea house, eaten a meal of Korean food and stocked up on souvenirs for those at home. How authentic and representative of Seoul it is another matter. The area is certainly historic but an overwhelming percentage of the buildings are not. Still, it is a nice place to stroll and people watch, especially as the sun goes down and the place starts to light up. Just be aware that many of the people that you watch will not be Korean. Keep an eye out for the resident Hare Krishna devotee handing out literature and the older man who plays the violin (badly) for tips, hopefully to pay for sorely needed lessons.If you’re in search of, perhaps, a slightly more authentic side of Insadong, stray off Insadong-gil into the side streets and wander aimlessly there."
"Market of Art, Antiques & Crafts","Insadong is indeed full of Korean Art, antiques & crafts. It gives visitors a chance to experience contemporary & traditional Korean cultures. Besides the main street, the side lanes are full of little stalls offering crafts as well as books. Cafes, pubs & restaurants provide traditional & fusion Korean cuisines, snacks as well as international flavours."
Art & cultural thing,"Tried some ""walking stick"" ice cream in one of the shop, bought some handmade candies (in white sugar coated thing, can't remember the name).Went into 1 traditional tea and dessert shop. Nice and quiet ambient, but a few interesting food on the menu is not available. In fact, the menu selection is just approx 20 types for drinks and dessert. We order 2 types of dessert made out of rice flour and glutinous rice flour and traditional herbs and 1 traditional tea which cost us $35000 won, which is quite expensive. All in all, is still a great place to go if you have extra time for something other than fashion & cosmetic shopping."
A great place to have a hotel room.,"Great area. Narrow streets, lots of shops, good for people-watching, and very close to main attractions. You can walk to a lot of them. ."
Nice place for gifts and local food,Pretty nice place to walk through... If you don't have much time and you want to buy some gifts or to eat local food this is a good place to start from.
A good place to find Korean souvenir items,If you want to find good Korean souvenir items then Insadong is the best place to visit. It's also near to some Korean palaces. 
Traditional area,Just get lost here and you will discover the old korea I really love this place but avoid it after 5 pm. It's very crowded specially in holidays and weekends 
Great fun in Seoul,"Great fun for tourists, best buys are the placemats and chopstick sets lots of choices and colours, and take the time to have studio photos taken in traditional costume, reasonably priced. Check out some of the street food, watching sweet making by an amazing Kkultarae maker is a must but if you purchase some freshly made eat it quickly as it does go hard so you can't keep it for later! Go up the street then up into the levels of small individual shops, much better quality some beautiful products such as creating a porcelain music box great gift or keepsake. "
Boutique style shops,Many places had individual items some hand crafted and alot of unqiue artwork you could purchase or see. Definitely a really nice side of korea to see compared to other shopping areas.
Very commercial for my taste,"It was crowded, so good for people watching. Alleys are interesting. Handmade paper stuff to different kinds of art, including tat. I did like the guy at the end who hand paints the fan on paper. You can get your name painted and it also includes the artists signature. Apart from that, I was exhausted braving the crowd."
Traditional Korean Tea,"Insadong - a place where you can just walk slowly and see different kinds of traditional souvenirs. What I love most about this place is, I could enjoy various traditional Korean tea. I would go back there just to enjoy the tea."
Loved it!,"This area seems to attract the locals, and what better recommendation could you have for food, trinkets, clothing, materials etc?"
A shopper's paradise!,"This shopping area (quite close to the large palace of Gyeongbokgung) can get very crowded but there's a real buzz about the place. It's where you can see the old Seoul with its alleys, craftsmen and workshops. Now it's full of souvenir shops, all selling various items ('pojagi', traditional ducks, made-to-order engraved seals, pottery...) at good prices.There may be a bit of leeway for haggling and bringing the price slightly down if you pay cash, but don't expect massive discounts. There are also street vendors selling you coins, bags or paintings amongst other things."
Many shops and Event,There are many shops in Insadong to eat. So if you want to go there you should skip your meal and buy there.Many events in INSADONG but it's very small place.
A very good area,We stayed in this area and we found it very close to the 2 main palaces and public transport. The main Indasong gil is a small street where you can walk up the middle of the road with only an occasional car. There are lots of shops and places to eat. It is also worth aking the time to walk down some of the smaller Indasong lanes. I found a few shops here to buy clothes very cheaply.
A little bit of everything.,"My favourite part of Seoul. Always changing yet always vibrant. Lots to see, eat and buy there so drop in and have a stroll around!"
Worth to spend half day there,"That region is very nice, especially the shopping street. Besides the famous shopping malls, the shops along the shopping street offer fairly good variety of items."
"Muchos souvenirs, imprescindible regatear!","Una gran cantidad de productos pero es imprescindible regatear para comprar souvenirs. If you don't bargain, they will take advantage of your innocence..."
Go to place for shopping Korean style,One early Friday afternoon after work my business hosts drove me to this pedestrian shopping area to browse through the shops for trinkets to take back home. We strolled casually up the main street and checked out some of the shops and stalls outside. I managed to dig deep into my pocket to buy a postcard. But somehow I couldn't get inspired and eventually time got the better of us and we had to move on to our theatre engagement at 5 o'clock that same afternoon. I guess that if I'd had more time and a clear shopping list I could have made more us of this brief visit. Don't let my so-so review put you off coming here if you're looking for cheap souvenirs for the extended family & friends back home :-)
Fun area of the city!,"Great area of Seoul known for it's wonderful little shops. This is an ideal area to pick up some gifts for friends and family and all of the shop owners we interacted with were genuinely kind and friendly! We spent about 20,000 won (a humble amount) at one shop and the shopkeeper ran us down after we left to give us a couple of free gifts to thank us for our business! Cool area to pick up souvenirs and gifts!"
Fun place to be,"Good place to go to for good food... Lots of nice boutique for clothes, jewelry etc. fun to walk and browse through the shops around the area."
Insadong - pedestrian street walkabout,"Similar to pedestrian street in Guangzhou, A long stretch of street for things to see and buy. Goods are not cheap here comparing to Namdenmun. Most shop owners and street sellers are local Korean. I would not recommend this place to buy souvenirs. A lot of eateries shops and food to eat."
THE place to get souvenirs,"I love this neighborhood. Full of artifacts, souvenirs and street food. I definitely recommend a visit if you are planning to buy something authentic."
Traditional yet exciting,"This street has lots of traditional restaurants and cafes. There are also art galleries, souvenir shops and other cool stuffs, but usually items sold here are quite pricey."
Nice shopping area,It is a must to go Insadong for shopping of korean souvenirs. Though very crowded but also a good chance to experience the good vibes and mood and enjoy the nice and tempting smell from the food stands 
Artsy place and has street stalls with cheaper prices,"This is a more artsy place compared to the more popular shopping areas like Dongdaemun or Myeongdong. Me and my mom didn't spend too much time here, but during the time here, we really enjoyed it. It was not very crowded, just okay, and stuff were much cheaper than in Myeongdong. Can't compare to Dongdaemun because I didn't go around there shopping for stuff.This would be one of the ideal places to shop for authentic Korean souvenirs. I stayed near Myeongdong so price-wise, Insadong was way cheaper. Say a postcard in Myeongdong could cost you 1600 won (it was an illustrated postcard by this popular artist tho) but you can find a pack of 10 (with traditional Korean illustrations- kind of like Chinese painting-esque) for 4000 won. I was sending lots of postcards so I was happy to find this. Haggling is still possible but I didn't expect much.In conclusion, Insadong is a good place to look for cheaper stuff, or spend some time in cute tea shops, or even go to galleries."
Shop and Enjoy,I had fun exploring this area of South Korea. Souvenir items are sold everywhere. Experience street food and some Korean restaurants. People are flooding everywhere but the walking down the streets of Insadong is something worth remembering.
"Korean traditional shops, cafes and restautrants","In this place, you can enjoy Korean traditional shops, cafes and restaurants. This street is very famous for Koreans from other cities and foreigners and worth to visit. Seoul citizens visit this place mostly to enjoy cafes and restaurants. I am a Seoul citizen , so I visit this place to enjoy Korean traditional cafes and restaurants."
My Favorite Place,"Insadong has it all! Shopping, cozy tea rooms, good restaurants, and more! Great place to spend an afternoon exploring!"
Fun and interesting,Insadong is a great neighbourhood that need to be explored. There is just a lot of things to see here. Really fun and interesting. Lots of store and eateries. Its crowded but still easy too explore. Plan to go here along with bukchon hanok villaage and changdeokgung palace as its nearby. 
Nice way to spend a Sunday,Interesting area with free shows and things on Sundays. Lots of little shops with handicrafts and Korean articles.
"Great shops, great food, great atmosphere","Of all the places my husband and I visited in Seoul, my favorite is Insa dong. There's so many shops to visit and browse, lots of reasonable places to buy presents for friends at home, and most of all, lots of great places to eat! We arrived here late afternoon coming from the Gyungbokjung Palace which is a walking distance from here. It was so much fun browsing so many stores, each specializing in different handicrafts. The choice of souvenirs is mind boggling and the price range is from reasonable to very expensive. But the best part for me was the restaurants. My favorite was one that only served Mandu and Naengmyeon (cool noodle soup). I had to go back to this small restaurant for both dishes the next day. Insadong is close to the metro and is easy to find."
Just go,Very nice area for food and drink and shopping....ton of nice local places with good food to decent prices...just an amazing place and a must see and do...recomended
Great place for souvenirs,Insadong is really the tourist place to go as you can do all your souvenir shopping there. There are also really good places to eat. My family and I went for the traditional Korean dinner in one of the restaurant on one of the small lanes in Insadong. There is also a small dumpling place to eat and the food was really delicious ! We were also lucky to be there when they had the Makeoli festival so we did have free Makeoli to drink ! :)
Very Touristy,Very touristy but definately worth a vist. Very crowded at times but brave the crowds and try some traditional tea cafes to enjoy the experience.
Great Shopping!,"This is a great place to go shopping for pottery, and higher end souvenirs. Amazing restaurants and coffee shops as well as great places to find unique Korean deserts and candy. There's a great used book stand on a side street where we found some great Korean art books at insanely discounted prices!! Have fun and explore!!"
Great just to stroll and experience,"We walked this shopping area several times as it was close to where we were staying. What a wonderful shopping area. One day there was a festival nearby. In the evening there were folks out busking. There were plenty of places serving coffee and desert and even food.One thing, though. If you're shopping for clothes, all of the stores are quite small and don't have a place to try stuff on. It's a shame because there's a wonderful Korean design ethic and the clothes looked very attractive."
Nice place to walk around,A trip to Insadong was part of our tour. a Great place for people who like to browse and shop. Since I am not really a shopper it was just a nice place to walk around and look at the different shops and architecture. It was very crowded.
Buzzling street...little bit crowded,"Interesting street with plenty of shops, cafe etc.Today is little bit crowded , due national holiday, a lot of tourist coming....but it is okay for me"
Lots of interesting gems waiting to be discovered!,This is a fun and vibrant street with lots of interesting shops to venture into to! I didn't have enough time to see all the things in one afternoon so this place will definitely be in my itinerary again on my next trip to Seoul!
Good for touristy craft wears,This area is the place to visit should you want to pick up Korean craft style bits. There are still Korean beauty shops dotted around - just incase you missed the opportunity to pop into one somewhere else.
Touristy but manages to pull it off,"This is worth visiting as it is right between the main palaces and a short walk away from the Bukchon village. It can be rather touristy and shops sell more or less the same things but despite this the whole area still maintains a certain quaintness to it. This may be because we visited during the morning/early afternoon so the throngs of tourists had not yet arrived or the fact that the whole area is a charming mismatch of souvenir shops selling ugly socks, verdant alleyways and stands that sell outfits for your dogs.I'd recommend going down Insadong's various alleys and visiting some of the coffee shops which serve up absolutely (and I don't mean this lightly) excellent coffee. The art galleries along the street are also worth paying a visit. Souvenirs are a little tacky and generic so not quite worth buying, but then again we did not visit the fancier tea stores."
Insadong,InsadongThis area of Seoul is closed to traffic.It is a pedestrian street where you can find Korean manufactured hand made articles.They are not cheap but worths buying.
Never get tired of wandering around this precinct,"I love this precinct and never tire of wandering up and down and in and out of all it's nooks and crannies. Some may shame it for being a tourist area, but it is also alive with locals and for the most part, well priced goods. You have plenty of choice so it's easy to shop around if the price or quality in one store doesn't suit you. The shop keepers are welcoming and happy to assist when looking for something specific. As a fairly frequent visitor to Seoul for business, (and more recently on holiday) a visit is never complete without a wander about Insadong."
shopping galore!,Stopped by this place during our city bus tour and was able to buy loads of souvenirs for family and friends back home. Dont immediately buy the first few items that you see. In my case I found out that the stores farther along the streets of Insadong offered much better deals. 
A nice stroll and shopping.,This area is full of antique and interesting shops. You can send a little bit of money or quite a bit. There is something for everyone. There are a couple nice tea shops as well. Oh and there is a Starbucks as well. 
Don't miss it,"No wonder this area is one of the most visited attractions of Seoul. It is a traditional streets where you can find an eclectic bunch of interesting items: shopping sites, simple and fancy restaurants, hotels, walking areas, craft, clothes and food vendors and whatever you look for."
Traditional Starbucks?,"Supposed to be the 'traditional street of Seoul' but with Starbucks? Come on.It's got some interesting stores and traditional restaurants but I'd check out Samcheongdong, which is near Insadong. It has more to offer."
More the traditional Korean market,Invading markets are more traditional Korean markets so you will get the cravings paintings masks brass silver there style of different jewellery a great place to cruise around with lots of stops at cafes on a humid day. We bought a painting jewellery. We went as part of a tour but went back on our own by metro easy to get to . Lots of gifts to take home t shirts silk wear etc 
Nice old town,"Oldest street in Seoul. Lots of small shops and trinket boutiques and food vendors. The only ""Starbucks"" required to be in Korean signage."
Tourist trap,"Waste of time, one street, with side streets that cater to tourists, nothing very authentic about this. Very busy, with bus loads of tourists feeding into the place. This is the kind of place I avoid when I travel."
Good for souvenirs,This area is really nice for tourists. They have a number of information booths with people that can speak English. They also have free maps of the area. It's usually quite busy. Great place for food and shopping!
NIce place to browse for souvenirs,"Lots of little shops but many sell the same things. Wide range of goods on offer from quality art to tacky souvenirs (often made in China) Plenty of street food available and little side alleys with tea rooms add to the interest. We ended up going 3 times because the prices were good and the atmosphere was lovely. Suggest you take Metro to Anguk then walk down one side of street and back up the other. Also within easy walking distance of the main palaces. Although pedestrianized, keep a look out for mopeds and scooters that seem to be allowed to go anywhere."
Artsy district,"I actually enjoyed insadong more than MYEONGDONG, insadong is a crafty & unique street featuring local arts. MYEONGDONG is Korean cosmetics on steroids! Lots of restaurants to eat nearby in traditional Korean houses. Ask for recommendation from the tourist information booth."
Brilliant area to stay,Wasn't sure before I went but so glad I stayed here. Great area. Lots to see and do - close to all the palaces and transport. Certainly a good base for trips in Seoul.
One of the better shopping districts,"Insa-dong was very popular with the locals. When we first got there about 1PM on a Sunday it wasn't too crowded, but when we left, about 3PM, the place was packed.The women thought it was a good place to shop for some local trinkets, but I preferred to take advantage of some of the local street food. I bought a hodduk from this one vendor, mainly because she had a line of people standing in line to buy them. It was delicious. Like a doughnut without the hole. The filling was brown sugar, cinnamon, and chopped nuts fried fresh while you wait. The served them to you hot so you drooled waiting for them to cool down.Later on I had a shrimp cake on a stick. I enjoyed that as well.Apparently they don't mind if you drink on the streets, so I picked up a bottle of Cass at a quick shop and walked around enjoying the culture."
repeat highlight,This is a great place to explore day or evening; do both for full experience. Range of prices and goods. Great place to get street food
Worth a visit,"Very clean market and we'll situated near Seoul centre, can be easily accessed by public transport.Lots of shops and stalls offering a wide variety of wears, plenty of places to eat (majority of which offer Korean food) and plenty of places to grab a coffee including a Starbucks"
Very repetitive,"Tourists shopping street. You will find the same things over and over in all the stores. A few are different, but that's it. I think Seoul has way more to offer than that. "
Blow off the day...,"And have some fun as well. Very tourist friendly but not tacky. Nice food options from street food to international restaurants. Lots of back alleys and nooks to get into. Nice shops but this is where you can pick up a bunch of inexpensive souvenirs for the suitcase and nephews, nieces back home. And really central to lots of activities. So if you like walking - this is an easy place to start or end your day - as you take in the surrounding environment. "
Just So-So,Very popular for tourist and locals. Full of souvenir shops at higher prices than regular stores. Good place to kill time if you have extra. 
Souvenir shopping,Fun to go for souvenirs. Shopping tip: prices are cheaper at the stores in the middle for same goods offered at many of the stores.
Nothing special...,"A very touristic street, the only interest I found was on small side streets where you can find traditional houses, tea places and other interesting small shops..."
Great for a stroll,"After visiting the palace , we strolled down the alley at Insadong. Tons of local shops and food attack the senses. Take advantage of the offerings and shop for some souvenirs. Makes for a pleasant afternoon to experience some local fare. "
One stop shop for Souvenirs,"My boyfriend and I walked here from Myeongdong, as it is pretty close. A lot of Seoul is walkable to be honest, and it's a great way to see the city.Insadong is a great place to visit just for a short time to get some souvenirs for yourself and your friends and family It is the traditional and craftsy area of Seoul. It is a tourist trap but you're a tourist! We went in the morning on a weekday so it wasn't very crowded, it picked up more around noon when we were basically done. It doesn't take very long if you want to just stop by and take a look. We did the entire couple of blocks it was on. A lot of things here are all Korean hand made crafts, such as ceramics, tea cups and other ceramic goods. They also have hand made mother of pearl jewelry boxes and mirrors. They also sell a lot of Korean spoons and chopsticks for cheap here - around 2,000 won.We also got K-pop star socks and calendars for our friends here. We didn't really see this anywhere else. From here it is just a short walk to Gyeokbokgung Palace so you can hit it up in the morning and then keep going!"
"A must - Even if it doesnt ""Blow your mind""","Insadong Market is everything that you already read online. A long street with countless shops and restaurants on either sides, with more in the small streets and alleys adjacent.Im not a big fan of buying souvenirs. But if you want to buy the latest hand, arm and head massagers this is the place. Do not pass up the chance to try the tube ice cream, i was skeptical but after trying theyre fantastic so yummy! The restaurants i tried were traditional Korean, they dont allow you to just buy soju and sit there, you have to buy food.At any rate, its yet another meeting place of all foreignors in Seoul.Personally i prefer Meyong Dong because it has all the brands.Still, you cant miss Insadong for a few hours(Not more)."
Try the honey specialitites,Insadong is a wonderful area in which spend a night. There is many restaurants and shops some traditional and other contemporanean. There is little bars in each corner and great venues with delicious food. A must when traveling to Seoul
"Touristy, but centrally located and fun",We stayed in Insadong (Insta Hostel) because of easy access to Anguk station and walking distance to almost everywhere we wanted to be.
Afternoon activity II,Typical Asian street market. Lots of souvenir shops. Definitely you have to negotiate prices. Street food is also available.
Viva Insadong!,Our hotel was walking distance from this popular place and we go here almost everyday to buy gifts for our loved ones. We also love the food from the different restaurant in the area.
Must go,"Insadong is a ""must go"" for all tourists to Seoul. The ambience there is just lovely, with quaint little shops selling all sorts of ware from good quality souvenir t- shirts to calligraphy brushes to pottery/ ceremic ware.i enjoyed browsing through these shops , and picked up a souvenir or two. Also had a traditional Korean lunch at one of their cosy beautiful restaurants there . The place is within walking distance to the Gyeongbokgung palace"
Not good compared to past..,"It was the very Korean style where you felt in real korea. But now? Not! It changed too much. Not korean, not specified style. It just not shows true Korea, but sales goods and food. Very sorry.."
not really traditional at all...,"you will have to go to the side streets for the more local experience, i found the main street quire boring... but probably because i am interested in the malls and the hyper markets rather than independant stores"
Shopping,"This little street was so great for window shopping, and getting some great local snacks on the way."
A 'must do and see' Seoul City area.,"Spent many hours wandering through main and side streets enjoying the many obvious and hidden delights to see and or buy which aid understanding of South Korean culture. It's highly artisan and full of creativity. Stunningly well organised whilst maintaining quaintness, character and interest. Plenty of eating places. Allow plenty of time. Not to be missed! "
Tourist shopping street,"Close a bit earlier than I thought as its quite a touristy place. Not only shops closed early, restaurants too, so beware! "
Best souvenirs in South Korea,Definitely worth going to for the range of really nice souvenirs available... Insadong is accessible on the red hop on hop off bus. Also get a rail pass when in Seoul as the subway system is great..
First time,This is first time to Insadong and at night it is very busy with street stalls selling all types of items and food. Also many different coffee houses and restaurants
"Touristy, but hidden gems","Very fun neighborhood with great location and lots to do. The main stretch is very touristy, but the side streets give rise to great food stands at night. Don't be afraid to stray off the main path. We had a late night dinner at the row of seafood food stands and were the only tourists in sight. Great neighborhood if you're looking for a blend of tourist attractions and authenticity. "
"Fun, Somewhat Touristy Neighborhood","Insadong lacks the oomph of certain other neighborhoods and attractions in Seoul. Still, there are all kinds of shops here, offering a variety of products that range from the authentic and artisanal to the kitschy and cheesy.It's worth a pleasant hour or two, just strolling through, people-watching and window-shopping. Also, the Starbucks at one end was, at least at one point, the only Starbucks in the world to use the local alphabet for its signage rather than ""STARBUCKS"" (in honor of this traditional neighborhood).Recommended."
Lovely,A place in which will meet your Korean expectation. There are many lovely Korean shops and restaurants there.
Insadong,"This is a great place to buy traditional gifts and have some tea. Also some great restaurants, especially if you're looking for more traditional foods. "
Great - still an area for locals,"The good thing about Insadong is that there was only one MacDonalds - the rest is pure local or regional quisine, drinking and shopping. This is where the locals come. The 'round-eyes' stick to Itaewan near Yongsan. Insadong has some amazing side and back alleys that open out into little oases of tea and coffee caffees and genuine Korean drinking dens, where the alcohol comes in huge bowls, one per table, with a ladle, and 3 or 4 tin cups depending on how many folk you are with.Insadong is easily reachable by asking any taxi to take you to Gate 6. When we visited, it was National Liberation Day, so the place was heaving, colourful and vibrant."
Touristy,"Our overall opinion of this street was that it was simply just too touristy, lacking in authentic goods and services. If you are in the market for cheap goofy knickknacks then you will enjoy this area. On a positive note there are some really good restaurants."
Must-visit Seoul destination,"Insadong street is the top tourist destination in Seoul for traditional goods shopping and local food. Here one should come to get souvenirs and taste the spirit of the typical Seoul. Remember that it's cheaper to buy goods from the sellers right out on the street than in shops, but mostly they'd accept only cash. No better place to eat traditional Korean food as there are dozens restaurants you can choose from. Lots of Vegan cafes too."
Wonderland,"We've just gotten home after discovering this wonderland of nighttime market stalls and restaurants. What an awesome area, there's handicrafts, ceramics, art shops & antique stalls to name a few. It wasn't crowed so we could easily get around. I'm planning on going back tomorrow night too."
Traditional street,"It's a street that full of traditional shop. It has a lot of local souvenir such as keychain, mirror, etc"
Fun and take the photo opportunities,My friends and I had a lot of fun browsing through the stores and taking pictures in different corners. Insadong has lots of stores and galleries. So don't miss the ones up the stairs or down in basements. They are definitely worth visiting.
Touristy street with not much to see,"shopping - touristy knickknacks, some restaurants, not much else to do, same as rest of the Seoul, close to Bukchon village"
"Diverse, eclectic and interesting","An interesting mix of old Korea, cultural Korea, touristy Korea and good food and snacks. We also had several personalized stamps made in both English and Korean. A worthy souvenir. "
Cosy neighbourhood,"Insadong is a cosy area full of small shops and nice restaurants. If you just have a couple of hours to walk around Seoul, it's a good choice!"
This place is awsome ,"This place is a great way to spend the afternoon in Seoul. The pedestrian street runs north/south. This means that you won't have to be staring into the sun. There are mostly shops, but you can find street food (yummy) and even some street performances. A great way to see culture. "
Good Shopping strip,There was a good shopping strip with a large variety of shops including quality ceramics. it is claen and safe and appeared to be frequented mainly by the locals. There are a lot of local attractions nearby such as the Changdeokgung Palace and Buckchon villiage. It is a very good central area to stay.
a souvenir centre,a must to visit place in seoul. A lot of store providing art and handicraft. Foods and souvenirs. T shirts are better then in namdaemun market.
Quaint,"A local Korean friend highly recommended me to visit this older part of Seoul for eat and shop. It is a safe neighborhood with charming alleys, located in between 2 subways stations. Shops among the street mainly selling traditional Korean crafts and souvenirs. Cafes, dessert shops, and restaurants were everywhere. Ssamziegil shopping mall was full of surprises - unique local artist/designer stores. Must see to appreciate it!"
Highly recommended visitor's spot,Good local foods and souvenirs. Always crowded with heavy tourers. Just avoid few local trendy restaurants and look for old and authentic restaurants.
Interesting,"Lots of restaurants and bars, both inddors or out on the street. Older area of Seoul that still has little alleyways that you can explore and find restaurants and shops or just check out how small somebody's house can be in the residential area. Note that it is generally a very safe area so you can walk late at night without feeling nervous."
The Best Place for Everything,On my trip to Korea we visited Insadong twice. There were so many shops with wallets and purses. Clothing and cute nick nack stores lined the street out outside the main market area. I got some really good sweaters and gifts for people back home from here. In the basement of the complex me and my boyfriend made our own rings with one of the craft vendors. I recommend it and they turned out very well.
Very nice,Beautiful place with a shopping street (no cars) in which you can buy typical Korean arts/crafts. The place to buy your gifts or souvenirs. We bought a lamp with special Korean paper wrapping. Unique and you can immediately see where it is coming from (and not made in China). We first went to the big palace and walked 15 min to Insadong. At end of the street you go to the right and you can get the metro again. 
enjoy the food,"Great place to wander and get some reasonable souvenirs. Also ate there and for 7000 won, got a main meal, lovely. Also we started with pumpkin soup then a vegetable pancake with lots of little dishes of things to add to it, all part of the meal!! My guide did have to explain what was in those dishes."
Tourist should visit,Insa-dong is full of life. Good for souvenirs. Lots of interesting shops and street food. Good for a stroll to mingle among others. There is a trick eye museum too as shown in my photo.
#Koreancharm,There will be no dissapointment when visiting Insadong; for food; safety; quirky and for spending your cash on souverneirs..Head into the narrow laneways and be amazed at the variety of food on offer...#Outstanding
Nice neighborhood to shop around,"This place might lead you to antiquing. There are shops selling vintage items, antiques porcelain and bronze statues"
A good walk on the main street,A tourist-y place for traditional Korean shops. I think it's generally a nice walk and the mall with the weirdest design is the must-see in this area. I also had dumpling lunch here and overall had an enjoyable time here. I find it's quite busy for a Sunday here.
Trendy and cool street in Seoul,"Gifts and handicrafts, artists and tea houses: this is what Insadong looks like. A bit expensive if you are buying something very unique - like I said, there are many artists in there -, but a very pleasant place to have a walk and discover more about Korea."
Fun,"Was a must to see while in Seoul,loud,busy,cheery folk,fantastic icecream,just the hub of every thing, a lot of the same shops,we did not buy too much but being in the middle of all the goings on was good fun."
Worth the crowds!,"This old-style art district is great for a stroll and some souvenir shopping. It's worth the crowds to experience the classical architecture and enjoy some uncommon Korean foods/desserts. The art here is hit or miss depending on your aesthetics. A lot of the shops sells handicrafts and other ""traditional"" things that, in my opinion, are pretty hideous. But hey, it's fun to browse!"
For souvenirs,"Insadong is is the place to find souvenirs, and eat Korean traditional food such. The place has a lot of foreigners and the energy is very good. "
Do not miss ,"This is a great area with art museums, shopping, and sightseeing. Enjoy street food or sit down dining. Very fun neighborhood. "
Good place to buy souvenirs,"This primarily is designed for tourists (both domestic and foreign) to buy souvenirs from a variety of stores. We found we were approach at the larger stores by sales assistants as soon as we entered the shops. The smaller ones, or ones run by single operators allowed you to view their goods casually making the experience more relaxing. The prices are similar to what you will pay elsewhere in Seoul the benefit is they are all here together and with plenty of eating places to boot. "
Highly recommend seeing this site!,Even if you don't buy anything I guarantee you will at least want to try the food and you will be amazed at the art here. This is a large tourist spot and for a good cause their souvenirs are cheap to represent your Korean pride. And they make traditional Korean goodies in front of you. This is definitely for the traveling shopper who has extra room in their bag!
Favorite neighborhood in Seoul,"Slightly touristy, but charming and interesting nonetheless! We went a few times and I still didn't feel like I had enough time to explore. Great for just wondering, shopping, and definitely eating!"
Culture street in seoul,Culture street that every shop brannds have own korean letter sign.G:jib restuarant; i recommend you to try once.
Fun place to hang out,"A great place for exploring small, quirky and tourist friendly shops. Lots of typical pottery/fans/paint brushes/traditional paper etc. A great spot for buying gifts to take home. An even better spot for street food (and street cocktails!). The centermark hotel in this area is very well positioned. "
Square handmade creation,"Fun, closed to Palace, temple, food, and square shopping mall where it sell all handmade artist creation. "
Pedestrian area with lots of Restaurants and cafès.,There is a lot of Local Korean Shopping experience as well as old Korean style Buildings for those who are interested in Historic Village style buildings.
Fun place to find Korean souvenirs ,"I always like walking around Insadong. Lots of fun shops, big and small, with Korean cultural items and souvenirs. Lots of Korean restaurants too. All the stores on the street have their store-name signs written in Korean, which is fun to see. A bit touristy, but worthwhile."
Two or three hours at most.,If you like to do all your shopping and people watching in an afternoon then Insadong is the place for you. Located near the subway and with plenty of places to eat. They have stores for all tastes. You can find cheap gifts and unique handcrafted items too. Most stores understand some English and the shops that sell beauty products were more friendly than in Hongdae. Grab some takeout and walk down to the river for some peace and quiet.
More of a party scene ,This place is more of a party scene. I'm not really into the party scene. I'm sure most people will find this area entertaining.
Isadong traditional street...,Traditional Street shopping on Sunday.Made a trip facinated with Hanbok traditional dress.Making of sweets n painting on t shirt.Also very well placed artistic design of crafts..A must place to go esp Sunday!
Insadong - a great place to experience Korea. ,"This is my second visit to Insadong in 8 months. The street has many shops dealing with varied items. Cafes, souvenir stores, food stalls, tea houses, fashion goods and others line the street. An interesting building is the shopping block that you can walk up by a sloping passage instead of stairs. We bought various items, had shaved ice mango and savored Jeju tea. When I first visited on a weekend, I remembered that there were steet performers too. Mix with the local crowd by your being there. "
Lovely,"A lovely place to sightsee and shop in Seoul. I bought many gifts for my family, and at a reasonable price. Don't leave Seoul without visiting Insadong. "
Great shopping and interesting quirky boutiques,"We wondered along this street for a couple of hours and I was really impressed with the variety of interesting shops to visit. Something for everyone in the family, rather than just cosmetic shops. Clothing, trinkets, sun glasses, shoes for both men and women, and great food stalls, even brilliant ice creams in crazy twisted corn cones. "
not as big as Myeong dong,"I find Insa-dong is quite nice and several small souvenir shops, but it is not as huge as Myeong-dong.the good thing is : Insa-dong is only walking distance away from Gwanghamun and Jogyesa temple, so you get 3 places in 1 go."
Great atmoshphere,"This was right next to our hotel so a great place to walk to at night, lots of people and stalls and atmosphere. Felt very safe."
Worth visting,Nice but couldn t help feeling a tiny bit of being a tourist in a tourism zone... But i might be wrong. 
probably the best place to buy souvenirs.,"I love this street! lots of vintage, cute souvenirs and many other things along the street. make sure to visit ssamziegil when you go to insadong!"
The cold brought people closer,"Don't just walk in the central street, turn to the left & right to find some hidden gems. Great coffee shops upstairs as well. "
Good for antiques and more but kind of pricey,If you just want low-end souvenirs this is not the place to come - go to Namdaemun market instead. But if you want nice antiques and higher end items then Insadong is for you. It's really quite interesting to walk around.
The best area of Seoul,"My favorite area in Seoul. The restaurants, tea houses, small shops, street food and cleanliness.Tip: they show you how to make some honey sweets along the main street. Don't miss it!"
Nice little shopping street ,Very near to Alive Museum. Interesting finds along the shopping street. Check out the buildings and coffee houses. 
traditiona area,very traditional area in seoul.cheap souveniors shop around there! you should ask for a discount!
A traditional stuff of South Korea,"I visited this place for shopping of traditional items of South Korea. I purchased few items, nice collection and art work. "
Loved this market,"This was the highlight of my daughter's trip. We went here 2 days and we still did not get to see all the shops we wanted to. Lots to see, very cheap. Note: the shops with air conditioning our guide told us have better quality stuff. Love it here."
lots of goodies to visit,"Pretty much a tourist area to buy and visit different stores (not necessarily clothes shopping but little souvenirs and art/craft)Lots of human traffic so beware of thatrestaurants/cafes/souvenir shops, street vendors..."
Tourist trap but definitely worth a stroll at least,"Seoul's an unmistakably modern city but it's done well to try to preserve the atmosphere of this old area. However, visitors will be mistaken to think that they'll immediately be transported into a different era when they arrive. Pockets of tradition do exist, including tea houses, restaurants, specialty shops and art galleries, but they're dotted along the main street (Insadon-gil) as well as the small side streets and alleys that branch off it. In some of these establishments, a sense of peace relative to the busy outside world can be found. If shopping 's more your thing, rest assured that the area caters to this as well as most other parts of the city. Some of the shops can be rather tacky but there are also interesting gems to be discovered, and plenty of snack stalls are often close by to sustain the hungry traveller. Some days, usually on weekends, some of the streets are closed to traffic. This allows the festive shopping mood to really come alive for visitors. Needless to say, it's also the most crowded time to visit, so be prepared to jostle a little."
Great place for souvenir shopping,"I managed to get beautiful embroidery here with good bargain price. And a lot of options that we can find here, from the cheapest to the most expensive ones."
Go for it!!!,If you want to know the real Seoul you should bisit this place. It has many shops that sells nice traditional souveniers and also they have nice restaurants. Sometimes some people sing on the streets which is quite romantic to listen to with your girl friend.
Great place to find good souvenirs!,Went on a Sunday and when we finally found it it was great! So many local stands selling souvenirs and food. The only thing we were disappointed that we couldn't find were Korean Mink Blankets. But made for a good afternoon of doing shopping and finding gifts to take back home. Be sure you know exactly where it was - our hotel said it dropped us off in Insadong but it was actually a certain street.
A must visit street!!!,This is the popular traditional street near the gwanghamun palace and it has a lot of traditional food and really good restaurants and cafes. It is also a great place to shop for souveniers and traditional clothing.
"Great for a stroll, but better for eating than shopping","Pedestrian-only on weekends, Insadong is a great place for a stroll. Prices for local good are higher here than elsewhere, but the people-watching and gallery-going is good value. Lots of place to eat and drink down all of the side alleys, where there are still bargains to be found. Too many chain stores on the main alley these days (for my taste). "
Seoul's shopping street with a class...,"Filled up with foreigners, this place too is a good shopping street. Items that can be found: Souvenirs (abundant), bags, leather, clothing, food, etc.,.Recommend:>There is some kind of a oval shaped fried bun with sweet filling , its a must try there, easy to spot as u ll have a long queue.>The multi-storeyed building with no steps...figure it out.>Wooden utensils / utilities are good (if you are interested)."
Good place to base in Seoul,"Favorite place to stay in Seoul/. Winding back streets, away from the traffic.Go to the hold in wall shops and restaurants. English isn't spoken or on menus, but that's a great part of the adventur"
Go off the main drag for better bargains,"This is The Place in Seoul for buying hand-crafted or unique Korean items. Insider tip: I've discovered the prices are far better if you wander into the alleys a little off the main road. It's basically the same stuff, but costs less. I've bought some fantastic antiques in this area. Try the street food (especially the ice cream that comes in a big elephant trunk looking cone) and head to the ""trick eye"" style museum if shopping isn't your thing. The museum is one of those places where you take pictures and it looks like you're part of the photos due to hyper realistic paintings. The kids loved it."
Another world of Seoul,"Quite touristy, but very nice place, different from the super modern and trendy Seoul, a neat quick tour to the cultural side with nice small shops"
"Busy, busy, busy","Insadong is one of the recent landmarks in Seoul, and I wonder why...First, the positives: on the alleys adjacent to the main street, you can find some of the best food in Seoul! Just look for my other reviews.Nonetheless, it is busy most of the time, there is no authenticity except for a couple of shops and prices are high. Bottom line: a tourist trap!"
Nice place for an evening stroll,"Husband and I took a stroll down Insadong on a weeknight enjoying the window shopping and people-watching. Having not really seen any souvenir shops during our visit to Seoul, we did find quite a few of them here. Some were selling the basic t-shirts and similar stuff (get what you pay for) but other shops sell goods of higher quality. We weren't really seeing the antique shops the area is known for having, but more art galleries. It was nice for a lazy stroll."
"Nice vibes, not too crowded and good shopping for local fare.","Little wholesale ""antique"" shops are the gems! Probably 10-20% cheaper than elsewhere. Unique and nice little cafes to chill and have Korean jujube tea! Close proximity to jogeyesa temple! "
Best neighborhood to walk,We loved the small streets and unique charm that his neighborhood has. We found our way there by chance and discovered later that it's known for that! Must see. 
I loved this area,I really like walking around / looking in all the little shops and food stalls in Insadong. There is also an array of yummy Korean restaurants and drinking establishments in this area. 
Where are the antiques?,So I came here because so many people talked about antiques here. But I did not see anything worth talking about. I did see a lot of replicas for souvenirs though. But maybe I was just more concerned about modern art and food which were everywhere. I went to a little shopping outlet call ssamziegil or something like that and that was really cool.
Must visit,We went to Insadong on the last day of our trip. There are a bunch of quaint shops and restaurants along the meandering street. We loved the cart food and shopping the best. Be sure to try the chicken skewers (the really spicy ones will set your mouth on fire).
Tourist street,This place does not deserve a visit if you are here for a few days. It is a street with some tourist shops and overpriced bland Korean food. The only reason I go here now is that there are a lot of Korean girls here looking to talk and meet foreigners walking around.
Wandering this unique little corner of Seoul at nightime is truly romantic,"I loved the small streets and unevenness of the little paved lanes, small lights illuminating restaurants. A sweet atmosphere to emanate from such a big city as Seoul is a truly nice. Loved the galleries and art shops - such a great collection of two things I love - local food and art!"
MODERN AND HISTORIC,"Insadong is the most popular tourist location in Seoul because it has many hotels as well as hundreds of Korean-style shops and restaurants. If you arrive by train, it's only one or two subway stops on the blue line (Jonggak and Jongno-3) to Insadong, depending on where your hotel is. We prefer Jonggak because it is right next to the medieval bell tower and the ultra-modern Jongno Tower. If you arrive by air, it's best to take a bus.Seoul is divided by the Han River into the northern section (Gangbuk) and the southern section (Gangnam). While Gangnam seems to be getting more publicity these days, the best part is Gangbuk which is really the center of the city.This is where Insadong is. Within walking distance of Insadong you have the World Heritage Jongmyo Shrine and a World Heritage medieval palace just north of it. The traditional Hanok Village is also within walking distance but it is no longer a village as it is surrounded by developed Seoul.The city center starts with the modern city hall and is within walking distance if you can walk three or four kilometers. Otherwise take the blue line from Jonggak to the city hall station. City hall is on the road containing statues of Korea's most famous king and its most famous medieval warrior. This road leads to another medieval palace which is more popular because it has medieval guards and a changing of the guard every three hours. We definitely want to stay in Insadong again. We stayed at the ibis hotel which we found to be most convenient."
Lovely pedestrian only street,"Lovely pedestrian only street with lots of shops selling souvenirs, transitional arts and also modern artifacts and designs."
All Your Shopping Needs,"A lot of great shops and sightseeing packed into one area.It's my favorite area in Seoul to shop because of the variety. This area has all your shopping needs: cheap souvenir shops (shot glasses, fans, magnets, shirts, etc.), Ssamziegil (building complex with handicraft shops), skincare shops, numerous pottery shops (this is THE place to buy it), lots of Korean food (restaurants and street food), a five story Daiso (you should Google it if you don't know what this is), etc. etc. But there's more than shopping, this area also includes (or is within walking distance of): Jogyesa Buddhist Temple, Bosingak Bell Tower, Cheonggyecheon Stream, Jongno Tower, Tapgol Park and Unhyeongung Unofficial Royal Residence. There's more than that but that's just to name a few."
Little gem!,A bit touristy on the main street but the galleries and the small shops on the side streets make it feel local! Beautiful souvenirs such as mother of pearl jewelry boxes and prints! I also saw many locals feeling nostalgic and buying old toys and candy! 
Great if,"If you are staying in seoul for more than 4 nights, i think this place deserve a visit from you. It is very nice place for walk, by sonouniers and have coffee in this street."
Good place to buy souvenirs,"A very interesting street with a lot of souvenir and traditional craft shops. There are also street vendors selling Korean sweets and snacks. It is worth a visit but it is a busy street with many tourists there. It was where I bought the souvenirs to take home but was surprised to see that the prices are negotiable! Many of the vendors made ""a special price"" without me even asking so make sure to ask for a discount first if you think the items are too expensive. The princes for the same product can vary a lot between different vendors."
"Insadong Great shops, galleries and more.","Perhaps my favorite area of Seoul. This is such an eclectic area, home to many galleries and unique shops. Wander the alleys and get lost, so many hidden gems in this awesome neighborhood. I like its location, it's surrounded by Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changdeokgung Palace, and the famous Bukcheon Hanok village is to the north. I would also check out Samcheong-ro for great cafes and restaurants, you can look down on this neighborhood from the top of Bukcheon village, which also gives great views of the city. "
Nice place to walk.,"We wandered though here on two separate occasions. Once by ourselves, and a second time with our friend from Seoul when looking for a place to eat...Walking, shopping, sightseeing and eating... all available to see in Insadong. Heck, even people watching was interesting.Great neighbourhood to hang out in for a while."
"One quiet, very nice neighborhood, secluded from the tumult of the metropole Seoul","So, I must say now that we were very lucky with our dwelling, at the times in 2008, during our visit to Seoul. Not only the vicinity of the most important shrines and palaces in Seoul, but also a proximity of the old commercial district of the capital of Republic of South Korea, was the very convenient circumstance for our group.That region is comprised of the main street, Insadong - gil and the multitude of the very picturesque alleys, that lead You further in the interior of the whole district.As we strolled along these streets with the planted trees at some places, we glanced at the very pleasant art galleries, small traditional restaurants, tea shops. In one of such characteristic korean restaurants, we ( my wife and I) tried to eat with wooden sticks. First little confused, then after awhile yet, accustomed. And what mattered more than that, that was the original korean food, very tasty, at moments, spicy.On the sidewalks, beside the walls, in the flea markets, there are many Buddhist sculptures, that attract the tourist attention. Some stores have had exposed hand pressed papers, which technic of making, I haven't seen in the other countries.And of course, the Korean traditional porcelain stores, are the ones You must visit and buy perhaps some products. Very interesting are the back alleys, here in Insadong, if You pace little bit slower and pay attention at the sideways.We loved this part of the city very much, indeed."
Beautiful street,Good place to stroll and shop for artsy and cute local stuff. This was were I bought souvenir items and gifts for my friends. This was also were I had my photos taken wearing gisaeng's and princess costume. This area is lively and lovely.
Interesting,It was interesting and a bit more quiet. lots of artsy stuff here. Worth a quick visit. We liked the cafes here and there was a tourist information not to far away from the metro station.
Not very excited,this place just straight a head....many souvenier store....not very excited just walking from the the start till the end of the market there is nothing special....
"Shop 'til you drop, then eat","Once my Significant Other found her way around Insadong, I had trouble dragging her anywhere else. Dozens of charming little shops and even more charming little restaurants. Clean, safe, less hectic than better-known Itaewon. Even some good street musicians many evenings. And a few museums and temples tucked in here and there. Delightful!"
Good place to visit for firs,Great traditional Korean and fusion food in insadong as well as shopping for souvenirs. There is also plenty of cafes both serving traditional Korean teas and coffee! Also there are numerous boutique art galleries showing contemporary and trditional art and craft.
Bewildering Sight!,"The main commerce street of Insadong is packed full of stores, stalls, eateries and shops galore. There is so much to see, eat and buy that there's got to be something for everyone. The prices of most goods look reasonable enough, and the souvenirs we picked up were competitively priced. A sampling of the street food was satisfying as well.Worth the trouble to visit."
small but lots to see,"it looks like one street but there are lots of little tiny streets with shops, restaurant and traditional tea shop. good for buying souvenir, trying korean traditional meal and tea. "
Interesting shops,Very popular shopping area in Seoul. Lots of good little shops and restaurants along narrow streets and alleys. Very nice place to shop for small souvenirs to take back home.
Great place to visit,Always happy to visit Insadong each time we go to Korea. It has a lot of small quaint shops for souveniers.
Touristy but good souvenirs,"This was an enjoyable part of town but also the most touristy area we visited. I bought my souvenirs here though as the selection was wider. They are very overpriced, so you're paying for the convenience of everything in one place. A street vendor offered ear muffs for $30 that we ended up buying two streets over for $3. She wouldn't negotiate the $30 either. I would go back for souvenirs but not for anything else."
Just have a walk,Nice little sidestreets to walk around with plenty little shops and restaurants.There are no cars so it's nice to walk around and see what's around.
Nice place to stroll,"This has become more commercial lately, with cosmetic shops, etc., but still has many of the original Korean wares and ceramic shops that give its charm. You can wander some of the side alleys and find nice tea houses and restaurants."
Shopping Heaven in Insadong,"Amazing, traditional shopping area with many tourist souvenirs and keepsakes! There are also many street vendors (Summer season) that sell traditional food. Popular area is the Insadong Street. "
Quaint and Chic shopping in Seoul," This was my favorite shopping district in Seoul, above Gangam. I loved the art galleries and traditional crafts and tea shops lining the lanes. Foot traffic was heavy and fantastic for people watching. "
Another tourist but creative place,"It's a pretty short street of gift shops along both sides of the street. Do take time to visit the little alleys which may not be that visible on the main streets. You could discover nice restaurants or tea house. However, the tea houses sell tea only and nil snacks. So be prepared to ask upfront, for what you want, and the price, to the owners who do not speak much English. "
Spend a relaxing afternoon in one of these cutesy teashops,"Insadong is a really nice area for a leisurely stroll, going in and out of souvenir shops, crafts shops, and teashops. This area is very artsy, we completely randomly stumbled upon an ancient Buddhist tower, traditional Korean fan dancing, and a cool art gallery. The teashops are a little pricy, but worth it because they're usually decorated very nicely, have good tea, a nice view of the bustling little street, free wifi, and offer a place to warm up and relax from the cold November winds. I really wish I had spent more time here."
Interesting place to visit,"You can find a lot of café and restaurants here after shopping. This place sells a lot of traditional South Korean goods and souvenirs, so it's a good place to get those. Recommend to take the city bus tour to stop by Insadong. "
Great for gifts or shopping... Expensive restaurants that have English menus!,"Insadong is one of my favorite places in Seoul. I love the feel of it and I love browsing in all of the shops. A lot of the shops are very pricey (they know their primary market is foreigners), but occasionally you can find a good deal. If you're looking for Korean food and you want to guarantee that you'll find an English menu then Insadong is a great place to eat. Just know that the price you're paying may be 3x what you can find somewhere else (and in my experience the food is hit and miss). One downside about Insadong is that you can rarely escape without being approached by school children to complete a survey. It's fun the first time, but on a busy day you may be asked a few different times. Maybe I'm just too nice because I have a really hard time saying no."
Traditional Crafts and Modern Ones Too!,"Charming, lively street full of traditional Korean crafts. The place to go to for those special gifts or personal keepsakes you wish to take home that will remind you of that lovely time Korea. The street however is not limited to traditional crafts. There is a revival or traditional cooking too. Check out the booth with the 16,000 strings of honey candy. It was amazing to see it made! If you are Hallyu culture fan girl or guy, you can find poster, postcard, calendars, you name it, with your favorite Korean stars. Don’t be surprise if young people want to talk to you, ask you questions or even offer you a hug. Lastly, don’t be afraid to haggle, even in the fancy shops. If you are making a big purchase, they are willing to lower the prices. Oh, one more thing, right behind Insadong is Yogyesa Temple and you can buy lotus lanterns along that street."
"A market street, pleasant to walk through",A pleasant few hundred metres targeted for tourists not as cheap as the traditional markets but not as crowded. There is an excellent green tea place. Fabulous green tea ice cream. Good restaurants on side streetsPrices for small make bags and fans are quite reasonable
Presents for everyone!,"This is a small alley but it is a present buyer's paradise. It was here I found nice, small, and reasonably priced gifts for everyone on my list - from a woodblock print map of Seoul for the history lover, to a necklace for my goddaughter to a cute totebag for my mom. It is a tourist spot - but hey! I was a tourist"
"Pottery, tea and pricey",What would you expect from a tourist location. Though many locals venture through the streets and alleys. Wonderful assortment of pottery and tea houses at typically tourist prices. Apart from this the energy and experience is a must.
Very creative and inspiring,"Must visit place in koreaaaa. Love everything here. The handicraft, the store. You can take selfie everywhere. Happy l"
Only place to get souvenirs,"This is the only place in Seoul that sells decent souvenirs. You can buy the usual keyrings, hats, shirts, little figurines, masks and other knick-knacks and gifts to take home. There are lots of street stalls that also offer good mementos - I was very pleased to find one selling a huge range of old Korean stamps and banknotes."
Pleasant and relaxed,"This little street is really sweet. Much nicer than the bigger markets, more open space and relaxed. More souvineers and nic nacs and less small, cheap ladies clothing (for which I was grateful) and tacky handbags. good for a nice stroll and to picj up some nice and reasonably priced gifts. If you must have fridge magnets they do have them but there are some tasteful items too."
Visit korea,Main shopping area appears to be too touristy. Resturants and shopping are a bit more expensive than myeodong or nandaemon area.
Relaxing atmosphere and a souvenir haven,"It's a nice street to walk it, with mostly souvenir shops along the street. But there were malls that allows you to sit on."
Interesting and atmospheric ,Most enjoyable place to hang out as the sun sets. Lots of great shopping and food options. Good place to end up after the Bukchon Hanok Village walk
Lots to see and do,"I liked Insadong a lot.Lots of different types of shops selling souvenirs, earthenware, crafts, painting and calligraphy supplies, restaurants and coffee shops.There was a great buzz to the place, even on a wet Sunday, and when it wasn't raining there were buskers and someone doing calligraphy with an appreciative crowd round him. Closeby is the Jongyo Shrine, so it isn't all just shopping!"
Shopping,"This is the best street for shopping we saw. Pedestrian only area and some nice places you can sit up high, have a beer and people watch."
Fun for shopping...,... and I don't like shopping. It's worth stopping in and browsing. A lot is for tourists but definitely not all. I bought some beautiful paper from a real art supply shop.
Amazing place to walk and shop,"Insadong is one of my favorite place in Seoul. There are many unique shops and filled with creativity people. I really liked the antique shops, and the Korean traditional arts. There are many small shops which sell unique creative stuff like mini plants, wood, clothes etc. The place is really nice to chill.Overall, must visit if you are in Seoul."
Good area for souvenirs,Insadong is a great area for souvenir shopping and a few other things to do. I've visited the information center and they have a great area for hanbok pictures at a great price!
charming,"well worth 30 minutes of your time, but look out for pickpockets. my friend had her cell phone stolen while we were buying street food. "
Very interesting,"Insadong is interesting as it's a place where the old meets the new. There are lots of little boutique shops, I think browsing is ok but the prices are not very reasonable. There's a hip little art/shopping complex called Ssamziegil worth visiting. There's a starbucks which is the only starbucks in the world where ""starbucks"" is written in korean characters instead of english. Finally, my favourite in insadong were all the little dessert places serving up traditional Korean sweets like date tea and rice puffs - I've seen them in Korean palace TV dramas!"
"Suvinir street , good for walking",Not bad its good to visit to buy sivinirs and to try the traditional crafts.You can go by mitro or taxi depend where you stay.Its fun to walk there as there lots of poeple gathering.The street is connected to many ways you can go cross
love the place,"the must please in Korea that you should not missed it, Insadong the art place which keep traditional of Korea style with the contemporary, many of souvenir shop and good restaurant and also the tea shop.... i really stay all day at Indasong ^^"
Pleasant Arty District,"At face value this is just a big shopping street but if you explore the many side streets you can find interesting art galleries and nice boutique shops selling lovely arts and crafts (particularly pottery). It is a touristy area so is priced accordingly but it is a good place to window shop to get an idea of what is available in korea. There are also lots of young hip novelty shops as well as standard tourist shops and art/craft oriented galleries, so it is a nice mix. There are also plenty of little restaurants to eat at. You can also enjoy various street performances on the way. It is a pleasant place away from shopping malls with a little of old Seoul but be warned, it gets very crowded on weekends."
Cute Traditional Crafty Shops,"We enjoyed walking through this artsy neighborhood. It also has great restaurants and snack type foods. Coincidentally, we ate at the same mandu and fresh cut noodle restaurant that is supposed to be the best in Insadong in 2012 and 2015. Every restaurant looks good, get a good meal for inexpensive price."
"Just shops, nothing amazing","A tourist street with plenty of shops, but it seems to cater to Korean tourists as much as foreigners. Worth a visit, but don't expect anything historical."
Relaxing shopping,"If you are looking for arts and crafts or just want to wander around, Insadong is the pace to go. Don't forget to wander along the small alleyways where you will find lots of little restaurants"
Antique road with some cosmetic shops,"It is located near the palace, and Hanok village. Along the road side, there are many souvenirs and some nice hand-crafted gifts, cosmetics shops also be found in this road. Near to this road there are temple and shrine which is also nice and attractive. There are two (as I saw) photo studio that you could take a photo in nice ancient royal costumes, with make up and hair dressed approx. 25000 KRW per set of picture."
A bit cheesy,"Geared up for cashed up locals and tourists, the area still manages to convey a sense of old Seoul. Just don't expect a living museum. Rather than making it a destination, use it as an interesting connection with lunch between palaces."
Great place to buy souvenirs,This is a great street to buy souvenirs. Enjoy the cheep shops at the north end of the street and proceed to the original craft shops at the end. Be careful as the shop owners don't always add up the prices correctly. ;-)
Artsy place with street buskers,"Personally, I find the food more interesting than the samsegil building. Lots of nice eateries there. Bright & vibrant street. But shopping is boring. We dropped by for lunch after visiting a temple nearby. They sell lots of art & craft stuffs but they aren't really that interesting or cheap. Must try the famous ""dong-bang""Bread filled with melted chocolate. "
Great for tourists,"A variety of shops and restaurants, lively atmosphere throughout the day. Could take you anywhere from 20 mins to 3 hours depending if the shops have what you are looking for! I had great stone-pot rice lunch there, so managed to buy some cheap souvenirs :)"
Friendly and dynamic slice of Korean culture,I stayed in a hotel in Insadong. The shops were wonderful and prominent young people dressed with hat and red outfits who spoke English to help you find your way around. Many people also came up to you with freebies advertising the Olympics in Korea. Very artistic area of Seoul and centrally located. Easy to get to wherever you want to go from this location.
Cozy atmosphere combined with fun,"Insadong is just excellent for everybody, whether you are a foreigner visiting to experience some hanok experience in the middle of the Seoul metropolitan area or a local Seoulite just visiting for great food. They have it all, from the artsy Ssamjigil to the Trick Art Museum. My favorite part of Insadong is the DIY shops on the basement level of Ssamjigil; you can make your own dolls, rings, etc. for a small fee. Insadong is also home to so many great, cozy restaurants and cafes. If you're taller, though, beware--you might not fit into some of these buildings. "
Good to visit just for sight seeing,"Even if you have nothing in particular to buy, it is worth visiting Insadong. It has its own character with its row of shops and stalls for you to experience. I have been to Seoul many times before but never visited Insadong. I should have come before. Thanks to my other significant half who planned our visit this time."
Great place during Holidays or for purchasing Tourist-y things,"If you like shopping and want to find some cool Korean gifts/trinkets, this is the place to go. There is also some EXCELLENT street food, similar to Myeongdong (but I enjoyed Insadong much more). If you're only in Seoul for a week, I'd say it's worth a stop-by; plus it's close to many other attractions via bus/subway or even walking."
Nice,"Nice place for tourists , Jogyesa is near by and this street has a lots of antique shops which i feel is quite pricey .. Not sure if the antique collectors feel the same"
"Great, central area with a charme of a small vilage","Nice little are right in the middle of Seoul. We stayed in a hotel there and enjoyed that we could walk through Insadong, especially at night as there are very good restaurants. Close by the metro and the famous Cheonggyecheon river walk. "
Great Nighttime Activity,"This was the first place we visited when we arrived, and it is a great introduction to Seoul. Lots of restaurants to choose from, shops, street performers at night, etc. Mostly Koreans were about, which made me think this was a popular local attraction too. When catching a taxi, make sure to pronounce it as Inzadong (the ""z"" is very important). It is very close to several other attractions, so be sure to plan ahead. I would recommend coming here after visiting the palaces, and when other places have closed for the day. Open late."
Interesting and lively street,Its worth taking a strolll down this area to shop for either local korean cultural merchandise or for a meal. The street is mainly filled with pedestrians but cars are allowed to use the streets so you just need to be careful of passing cars and they get within inches of you withou honking. I would also recommend having a restaurant in mind so that you are not just taking a flyer on where to eat...there are too many places to choose from. You don't need more than an hour to stroll through and peek into a few shops...its a pretty small area.
"Touristy, but a great place for a spot of shopping",Insadong is a must see for anyone visiting Seoul. It may be aimed at tourists but it really is a great place to visit for a bit of shopping and to try some street food. Visit one of the tea houses for a great experience
Very worthy to walk through,"This is the best market in Seoul, in my view. In fact , this is a place where any tourist can purchase traditional Korean products in a cheap price. Very colourful and crowded place. Very close to metro rail station (Jogno-2)."
I love Insadong,"I love this place, I need to go back and get some stuff. There are some pretty rubbish tourist junk stalls but there's also some great traditional paintings and ceramics. The small lanes running off the main road hide some nice restaurants. "
:),"Lots and lots to see. Good vegetarian food, sidewalk performances by street dancers, abundant food tasters, tourist information centers to try on hanboks, vintage goods and loadsss more :)"
Interesting,"We had our hotel here, which turned out to be a great location. You can easily access sights from here by foot and theres a lot to see around Insadong. It was a bit of a artsy place with lots of boutiques, cafes and restaurants so you can easily spent hours strolling around the streets."
Many things to see and eat,"this place is good for food and buy curiosities. small streets with lots of small restaurants that you will enjoy visiting, some places can be bit expensive but anyway you will enjoy coming to this place really enjoyable"
Souvenirs and Art Galleries abound.,"Shops, restaurants and fashion give you a truly Korean experience. Lots of vendors speak English and are very welcoming and approachable. The promenade is closed to vehicular traffic so you can wander freely and explore. You will have a great time."
Touristy for me,"enjoyed that this is a pedestrian walkway, but having been to many cities in Asia, i found it a little too touristy and not as interesting from a historical or craft perspective. "
Easy to get here.,Interesting and vibrant. I can spend hours and hours walking around here! The first time I came it was raining heavily and did not do much. The second time I spent a few hours just walking slowly and savoring the sights. Tried a few snacks and had my first cold noodle dish here. 
A crazy great place to visit!,"A must do experience. There is so much to see here from morning to late night. Food, shops and people watching."
Cobblestone streets with hundreds of small shops and restaurants.,Wonderful shopping area that is waiting to be discovered! I found gifts and objects like no other in this shopping area in Seoul. Small shops that offer great service and selections of some of the most unique items I saw in South Korea. There is a specific shop that makes a marble stamp with your name in Korean. Kings and Queens and other dignitaries have traveled to this shop for their personal stamps. One example of a unique gift in this cobblestone area of small shops in Seoul. Must try! 
Wonderful art district closed to traffic on Saturdays,Had a beautiful spring day in Seoul and went to Insadong to explore shops and just enjoy a pedestrian mall setting. Very nice shops with unique clothes and art and art supplies. Lots of charming restaurants and coffee shops and street vendors. Highly recommend a vist
Purely touristic,It is nothing special. You can buy there some souvenirs. Restaurants are expensive and served food in only mediocre quality. 
Cute shops but nothing special,"Does not compare very well to similar urban spots around the world. The shops in the pedestrian area play the ""cute factor card"" to attract traffic and perhaps they are successful, but they are not cheap.The whole area lacks character - there is not much authenticity here, but can be explored easily in an hour or so.Insadong becomes very, very crowded later in the day, so I suggest you go in the morning and then go to one of the nearby museums or palaces until the evening."
Good for Korean gifts,Bring a Korean or speak some Korean to negotiate better prices. Some shops give cash discounts or discounts for multiple purchases.
Still worth it,"I've been visiting Insadong periodically since 1997 and have watched its transformation fomr a sleepy local antique and traditional market place to a pumping throbbing tourist hub. But not all tourist hubs are automatically bad. The only major influx of 'bad' is all the trinket shops that dominate the main street, but still they are loads of fun and lots of little stores and side streets full of interesting stuff. The main antique stores are too expensive and don't even know if they are authentic anymore but lots to peruse through still.A must visit for any first time visitor to Seoul!"
Not bad,"This place deserves a short walk.. I like it that you can soak into the atmosphere and browse through the shops without getting harassed by shopkeepers as you would definitely meet in Namdaemun Market or Myeongdong.Best of all, most of the items/gifts have standard price throughout Korea. Maybe im the type who dont like to bargain, but I think this system gives me an ease of mind when i purchase gifts. This is a good place to buy souvenirs than compared to Namdaemun for sure."
Quaint shopping street,I liked Insadong for all the shops were down one street which was closed to traffic. Some great shops including some expensive antique shops. I sampled their Osulloc free tea and purchased to take home. I also purchased some of their hand made paper. Most of the shops allowed you to use their toilets without having to purchase things. A definite must on your stay. Allow 2-3 hours.
Shopping like a hippster,"This neighbor was genuinely hipster and the stores go on forever. While shopping there you can find a certain type of candy that is mostly only found in this neighbor its has an interesting texture to it but the are good if you like peanut butter, chocolate and honey. The shops are small but if you are looking for anything from handmade pottery to traditional teas this is the place to find it. Some of the shops products even date back to the Three Kingdom Period (57 B.C. - 688 A.D.) While some shops contain products as much as 100 won, while some of the most popular items are Korean ceramics ranging from prices in the hundreds to a few thousands of dollars. Due to the small space between the buildings cars are not allowed down the street so walking is a must in this area. This is definitely a place to hang out, shop and have lunch."
Ok... but nothing great,"I do not really understand what is the big deal about this neighbourhood, I don't find anything special here, just a few streets with stores which seem to be targeted to tourists."
Lots of variation,"Usually when you go to a country to visit these places, they have dozens of identical stores, in which you're expected to just choose the one you think you can bargain down the most or whatever.With the Insadong area, there was a bit of that, but there was enough variation that you can walk down it and see something new the whole way.To enhance this, it's not just there for shopping traditional stuff. It's littered with art galleries, more so than you might think. There are some big ones - one in particular has 5-6 floors of exhibitions - but there are dozens of hidden ones in basements, barely signposted. You can be there for hours just spending 5 minutes in each one.If you don't like art then whatever. Still got good cafes, free wifi access down the whole street and walking distance to other stuff like Gwanghwamun."
souvenir! shopping!,"if you're looking for souvenir before leave korea, insadong is one of the best place for you. i bought many traditional korea bowl and chopstick and spoon here, around 2000 - 3000 krw can get. many different cute and signature korea bag are selling. spend 2 hours here for shopping. "
This is s place where you can visit after Bukchon,"From Bukchon walk back to Anguk station and exit 6, walk about 40m on the left is the Insadong walking street. There are also many roadside eateries where you can try the local food.You can visit the Ssamziegil where all the artistic stuffs are available."
"Good for shopping, but very crowded","Insadong is the place to go for traditional Korean souvenirs, as well as having a few nice restaurants, traditional tea shops, galleries and so on. You can find everything here from calligraphy to fans to furniture to paintings to clothing to jewellery, and ranging from the traditional to the slightly more Bohemian. Be aware though that at weekends in particular the street can be absolutely heaving with people. If you're planning your day, Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces are only a few minutes walk away, as is the lovely Jogyesa temple."
Busy but pleasant,"Neighborhood full of shops, restaurants, temples and small alley ways and streets. You can wonder around entire afternoon or evening, great people watch - would I go back? Most likely not, there are couple places that I have not have time to visit while my stay in Seoul so this will not be on my list."
A must see,An old area of Seoul that is worth the visit. Lovely little alley ways and winding streets. A great variety of shops and street markets. Allow plenty of time to wander.
Wonderful,"A fantastic neighborhood, full of shops, restaurants, temples, school, etc. you will love wandering a round the small alley ways & streets. Be sure to try some of the small cafes for soup & fish pancakes."
Great street shopping!,"Great shops and street shopping! Very lively area, perfect to get all your souvenirs from Seoul. The vendors were very nice and most spoke English. If you're looking for craft markets and shops, this is one stop shopping."
Lovely little streets to take you back in time.,"Seoul is changing rapidly and becoming a truly modern city, placing up skyscrapers whenever it gets a chance. However, in this part of town, you can still get a feel for the old Seoul with it's traditional buildings and little winding streets. There are a lot of tourists here, but with good reason, it's a brilliant place to pick up food, souvenirs and see a few street performers. It's close to a lot of city attractions so I'd make it my walk through between things rather then a must see. "
Artsy,"Lots of artsy type stuff available here. Geat place to buy inexpensive scarves & some homemade jewelry. There are a couple places that sell these ""J"" shaped ice cream cones. Its a MUST try! The cones taste like Cap't Crunch Cereal! :)A nice place to just stroll. "
Old time Seoul,"This is the place to go for crafts, souvenirs and food off the street. The street is bustling and old time Seoul comes alive here. Great contrast to all the big fancy buildings in rest of city"
More traditional items,Insadong is another shopping district but has more of the tourist souvenirs and traditional and historical items for sale.We went during the daytime so it was not as busy as Myeongdong but it still had its charms.Would recommend if you're looking for some souvenirs to remind you of Korea.
Totally love this place,"So much of artsy fartsy stuffs to explore, from modern to very cultural old brushes. Love the activities over there too. One of the best place in seoul, people are more cheerful here, if to compare to Gangnam area"
The place to shop for souvenirs,"It is a great place to grab your souvenirs, there was food all around, we just did not get any. Worth visiting. "
Very touristy but very nice,"This area is full of cute shops and restaurants. While it is clearly a very touristy area, it is well worth visiting."
For some shopping spree,"It is where the arts and crafts live. Some are standard merchandise (you find similar products in many stores). But still wonderful to see and - if you like - buy. Nice ambience, some street food. We loved it."
"Going traditional, the Korean way.. ","The streets of Insadong have many shops on either side of the roads which portray the true culture of South Korea which includes the beautiful dolls wearing hanbok, the traditional dress of the South Koreans,hand fans, keychains with cute little Korean dolls, Korean delicacies, long cones with lovely icecream served on the top, scarves for women, bags with unique designs on them,typical Korean statues which are extremely adorable and not to forget the street sea food that Insadong has to offer it's lovers..There were two professional musicians who were absolutely excellent and definitely amiable to speak to.. We also ate at an Indian cafe in Insadong, so Indians will hv no difficulty there just as we didn't face any.. Overall it's a great place with so warm and friendly people.. What else would an Indian tourist want, beautiful attractions, amazing climate and great natured people.. "
Such art,"A great place to shop for souvenirs and even though the street is quite long, you won't feel it because there's a lot of creative things to see and watch on the streets."
A great market,"Lots of interesting shops for art supplies, souvenirs, jewellery, food and much more. Most prices are reasonable. There are some really impressive shops for gemstones, pretty expensive but great quality and great selection. Recommended for every visitor in seoul."
"More or less a ""must-visit"" for tourists","Insadong is a great shopping street where you can load up on all sorts of Korean gifts for friends and family. Surprisingly not kitschy for an area that gets a lot of tourists. Try to stray into the back alleys to find tea houses and delicious restaurants. Insadong also attracts a lot of Koreans and this can be a place to do some people-watching, or catch a street performance."
Very tourist friendly,"this is the first place i went to in Korea and it was an absolute delight. there's so many stands for trinkets and souvenirs. Not everyone knows english so don't get upset when you're not understood. there's so many different stands, from socks to keychains to masks. delightful."
Great shopping and people watching street,"This well known street in Seoul is known for tourist shopping. But if you're an artist looking for inks, brushes, mulberry paper - this is the place. Lots of souvenirs for sale as well as high end women's clothing. Explore the small alleys for great restaurants. Try the street food, too!"
Great place to spend an afternoon.,"This is an older area of Seoul, that consists of most small shops and restaurants. The main street has become a little too main stream commercial, but still has many interesting local stores. The back alleys are generally more interesting. After you are done exploring, visit one the many cafes serving a patbinsu (mango is my favorite)."
Great green tea cafe there,"We tried one of the alley Korean restaurants for the full Korean meal experience since so many restaurants outside of this part of the city only offer a couple of banchan (side dishes). We went into one called Well Being. The kids and I really enjoyed the food though it was on the spicier side (but we can all handle spicy). They do have picture menus but I'm pretty sure they don't speak English. We mostly stayed along the main road since we were looking for a green tea shop/cafe since all the other little shops are more of the same thing. The green tea shop/cafe, called Olluroc, offers amazing green tea ice cream, if you like green tea. It is not too bitter but tastes just right! The green tea bingsoo isn't as finely shaven as other bingsoo places but the ice cream made it worth it and the taste is still good. If you are looking for cheaper souvenirs, you should buy them at Namdaemun, but Insadong is still a fun experience."
Nice tourist area for souvenirs,"Touristy area, but good for souvenirs. You'll likely find similar stuff in a lot of different parts of town, but Insadong has a lot of more cultural souvenirs that make good take home gifts."
"Vibrant, trendy, arty",A must when in Seoul. Full of small and elegant art galleries with a bohemian yet sophisticated feeling.
Love this place,"Our hotel Centre Mark ) was 1 minutes walk from here, magic, Areal funky place , bars, food ,great little shops and other interesting little places it's great just to lay back and cruise the zone interesting as anything , the locals are very friendly and everyone's happy, no traffic and no packed crowds. love it."
"Dishonest restaurant at Insadong, South Korea","During our trip to South Korea in May, we visited Insadong to have a glimpse of the artsy side of Korea. It was a nice place to have a stroll through. Unfortunately, we picked a restaurant that appeared to be nice and offered good lunch but turned out to be the worst choice we had made during the trip. The name of the restaurant is in Korean (as shown in one of the pictures). The address is Jongno-gu Insadong 6 Street 7. The restaurant is in one of the side lanes on the right. There are a few nice looking restaurants in the lane. The entrance of the restaurant is shown in the picture. They advertised that their lunch set (10,000 per person) consists of stir fried rice cake stew, kimchi pancake, rice, grilled short rib patties, grilled fish, 6 side dishes, choice of braised seafood, beef BBQ or pork BBQ. However, we noticed that what we got were different from other Korean diners. First, our braised seafood only had sliced squids and vegetables while other Korean diners had shell fish as well. Second, our meal did not have grilled short rib patties and grilled fish as advertised. When we told the cashier about this, he ignored our complaints and did not apologize but quickly took our credit card to make payment. When we stopped him and indicated once again our displeasure, he only minus 1,000 won from the bill and immediately disappeared to the back of the restaurant. Their service was truly substandard and was tantamount to cheating tourists.I hope to share this experience to warn visitors of this restaurant. We had, of course, been to many other restaurants and the experience was excellent, not to mention the delicious Korean cuisine. Just be wary of set meals. You are much better off ordering individual dishes."
quaint area,"we walked around insadong for an hour or so; theres no vehicular traffic allowed and there are small shops, cafes, restaurants all around. the ambience is nice and we had fun"
A Traditional Place in Seoul,"I recommend Insadong to tourists who are going to travel to Seoul, South Korea. First of all, Insadong has a good location because it is in the center of Seoul. You can take the subway to go there. It is located very near Jong Gak station. Moreover, there are many other great places to sightsee near Insadong. For example, Gyeongbok Palace is placed 15 minutes away on foot from Insadong. Gyeongbok Palace built in 1395 is the oldest one among five royal palaces of the Joseon period. Also, Bukchon town where traditional Korean house are concentrated in is also placed 15 minutes away on foot. People really live in house in Bukchon and there are several accommodations which have the structure of Korean traditional house. So, if you want to stay there, you can book it.Furthermore, there are various and special food. I like street food in Insadong because it is cheap and I can eat while I’m walking. You can eat not only Korean food, but also different countries’ food like crepes and waffles. When I ate a big ice cream waffle, I’m surprised to see the price because it was just 2000won. 2 big scoop of ice cream inside waffle was fantastic. If you want to eat Korean food, I recommend Hodduck which is kind of Korean bread because it is the one of the most popular food in Insadong. They put the honey inside dough and make dough thin on a hot plate with oil. It’s a little chewy and sweet. The most important reason why I recommend visiting Insadong is that it’s the one of the places where you can feel Korean traditional atmosphere in Seoul. When you go to Insadong, you will recognize that all signs of stores are in Korean letters even if the original name is English. In addition, there are many Korean souvenir shops on the street and in Ssamzi Road, so it’s good place when you buy gifts for family and friends. Additionally, traditional Korean music concerts take place frequently on the street, so you might hear Korean traditional music played by Korean instruments. But unfortunately, the places which have Korean atmosphere have disappeared recently because most buildings are modernizing and people aren’t really interested in traditional things. Therefore, I want Insadong to sustain Korean culture and hope that many tourists visit there."
Fun and full of culture and great finds!!,Took a walk through the area and found great gifts to take home and had a nice feel for traditional Korean culture.
"Liked the area,but not wow","We liked the area but not very wow, there are some shops and local street food. Im not type of person likes asian street food so I didn't try any. We ate at one of the Korean restaurants and it wasn't that good. But overall we enjoyed the walk and bought some local tea and traditional dress."
"A must go if visiting seoul, good Korean items shopping, nice street food and good Korean restaurants.","Great tourist attraction for good food, shopping for local Korean items, street food is amazing and they have great Korean cafes where you can enjoy local tea and snacks. We tried Korean restaurants and the food was amazing with reasonable prices. Have a lot of art galaries plus many handicraft shops for small gift items shopping. The street almost pedestrian but some times you can see cars and taxi coming in. Good touristy atmosphere.we could see tourist information people all around the place. "
Nice place for artistic stuffs,A place filled with stores selling artistic stuffs. Good to be here to find unique items. Eateries are along the streets too.
"lots of interesting art, see the old style houses","Really nice place to stroll and see old style Korean houses, lots of art galleries. There's a place where you can try a traditional Korean dress for 3$ or so."
The Best Kind of Tourist Trap,"Insadong is largely overpriced and touristy, full of non-Seoulites and gift shops, sometimes overcrowded and full of kitschy stalls. On the other hand, amongst the gift shops in gallery's clothes, there are actual, very interesting galleries. And Insadong has superb traditional art supply stores. They are a bit pricy, of course, but they have a variety and a knowledge about their products you can't find elsewhere. If you look hard enough you can find an actual traditional hanji store. :)"
Tea heaven!,"If you walk in the alleyways, you'll find plenty of teahouses. One in particular, Shin Old TeaHouse, is a superb place to visit. Located at the end of an alleyway beside the O'Sulluc, this place is small, peaceful and tranquil. They offer some interesting teas too. Worth getting lost for!"
Great place for suniour shopping,"There were all sorts of shops. Silver jewelry, beautiful pottery, key chains and fridge magnets, clothes, food, tea, you name it. Things were reasonably prices, but you may find cheaper markets as this one has a high tourist footfall. But it gives you the convenience of having everything that a tourist may be interested in at one place. If you are going to the Gyeongbokgung palace, must check out this street as it's walking distance from the palace. We got off the subway at Jonggak station and walked through Insadong on the way to the palace."
"seoul, very nice","Lively place. eateries, shopping,MTR, good connectivity, centarlly placed. However, overcrowded. People are very helpful."
Shopping and dining,"A very organize strip of shops and some restaurant, Prices are set and quality of goods are good to excellent but it is a very busy street for shoppers locals and tourist alike. I will recommend it to visit even for a few minutes...very interesting place."
Street Foods Heaven,"If you come here in the spring, come in the afternoon on the weekends. They have an interesting spring parade. The people in the parade seem to be enjoying themselves and the company of the spectators. You can even ask them to join in for your selfie.Don't miss the street foods, from macaroon ice cream, rice cake, egg bread, 'corn' dog, etc. Try them all, skip the restaurant lunches/dinners. They are all good and interesting. If you are rather tired, try the local cafe; they have interesting desserts and drinks. "
"Plenty to explore, enjoy and talk about...","Every time I am in Seoul, we never fail to spend one day in Insadong. Don't just pass through the main thoroughfare. In fact, real treasures are all hidden in small alleys. Don't be afraid of trying traditional Korean dishes, while picking us souvenirs. Small street food is also fun. I often spend time in a traditional handcraft shops."
Don't miss,"Better than the markets and with more life than any other place, we got lost here, many, many times during our stay and every experience was different. We'd recommend basing yourself around here - couldn't be more central and all Seoul is in these streets."
Souvenirs shopping,"A place to get souvenirs. From fan, stanless steel chopstick and bowl, hanbok, keychain, fridge magnet etc.. u name it all. Its all here.. its also the only place where shops name was written in hangul including starbucks.. "
A San Franscico Vibe,"Strolling along here reminded me of walking down the streets of SF or Seattle in summer. Streets were lined with shops and there is plenty of food choices. Not quite the hustle and bustle of Myeongdong, but alot more boutique like shops and some good coffee spots as well. Worth a visit esp. during the warmer months where walking while the sunsets and enjoying a cold smoothie really is comforting."
A Traditional Neighbourhood,"It has a nice traditional feel to this area. A place to get souvenirs & food. Plus, this is the place to get items like earthenware bowls & handmade clay cups. I got my Korean Dolsot Ddubaegi (Earthenware) Stone Bowl while my friend bought a handmade clay cup & we are glad that we got it for reasonable price (after haggling for discount). There are traditional tea houses and restaurants there too when looking for a meal."
Home of street food vendors and cheap souvenirs,"Somehow between my whining and a random train ride, we ended up at Insadong and finally had lunch. Insadong is the place you go to buy cheap souvenirs. It’s a very huge strip and they also have a ton of street food vendors. There was also this cool area we found that had a photo booth vendor which allowed us to dress in traditional Korean outfit for only 26,000 Won for the group. To many, this may have been a waste of money, but the laughs we got were priceless."
Great Shopping!,"We wanted to find some things to send our families for Christmas. We found a lot of great stuff here. Also, the best mandu restaurant I have ever been to!"
Lovely shopping area,"It is not as crowded as many other shopping areas in Seou. Here you can find all sorts of souvernir, design and girly shops. There is also variety of street food, including poo shaped sweet pastry. They seem to like this poo theme here, cause there is even cafe on top of Ssamzie market with plush poo on the tables. This area feels artsy and unique."
shopping shopping shopping,place for shooping. Check out the samzigil the 4 storey connecting shopping mall. Where they sell all the local product from handcraft to shoes and etc. Dont forget to buy a gift fOr back at home.
Nice local neighborhood,"There's a tourist info booth at the north end, with a detailed map of just that neighborhood. Great shops and street food. Highly recommend the Ongo street food tour."
a charming art street,i enjoyed walking along this street even i am not exactly an art enthusiast. it has many galleries and little shops where you can buy little trinkets and souvenirs.. it is also easy to find. just take the seoul metro line 3 to anguk station. insadong is just a few minutes walk from exit 6.
Would be more pleasant if spits weren't everywhere.,Visited insadong one afternoon in December 2014. We were greeted by the colorful and interesting shop fronts and buildings. Temperature was about 5 to 8 degree Celsius. It would have been a very pleasant stroll and browse if there were lesser spits/frozen spits/shop owners spitting/ passerby spitting. Smell was rather unbearable under the December sky. Cannot imagine the foul smell it it was summer.
Fantastic place,"A nice street with all sorts of shops, galleries, clothing, bags, food...nice shops, interesting shops, a MUST when you go to Seoul. A little bit crowded on Saturdays. "
Worth a visit,Great if you love market settings - tourist prices though so things could be a little pricey than other areas but well worth going to. There is a temple just round the corner which is amazing too. Subway closeby 
Great Korean experience,"Great Korean food. Restaurants line the street. You can pick which kinds of food you would have. And the price is cheap and the food are all great. If you are looking for traditional Korean stuff to bring home, Insadong is the place to go. I highly recommend this place. Don't miss to go and visit. It was two happy lunches we had there."
Fantastic for Souvenirs,"We went to at least 6 different markets while in Seoul, and this one by far had the widest selection of souvenirs. If you want to find something to bring back for friends or family (or yourself), you'll probably find it here!Beware though, we got lured into one of the places where they take pictures of you in traditional Korean garb, and while they said it would only be 25,000 wan at first, we ended up paying 120,000... to be fair, I could have handled the situation better, but still. There are much cheaper and more fun ways to get pictures like that."
Shopping heaven for art Lovers!!!,Art..Art. Art...all new and old mixed up....totally beautiful landscape...and buildings...clean and nice environment...good food around...check out all the cafes there....
Best place to go in the evening,This place is near where we stayed in Korea and we used to stroll there every evening. The food are very affordable and you can take it while walking along the streets. Lights at night are so beautiful!
Nice area to stroll in the evening.,"As our hotel was located nearby, we took strolls every evening, to eat street food. The streets are not as busy as Myongdong, but we're very interesting, especially during the weekend. "
Artsy Insadong,"Getting here, take ANGUK MRT, exit 6. Go straight until the tourist info. Then turn left. The entire street is the vibrant Insadong full of art. From mask to souvenirs to traditional fan and accessories There are a lot of restaurants to hang out to. There's one small mall available in the middle of the street, including Insadong Alive Museum."
Best for a walk and traditional food,"I wondered around the place and it amazed me with all collectable shops of traditional antics. Plenty of foreigners are there walking and doing pity shopping. Food restaurants are around the place and have some awesome ones, I visited with a Korean business partner and I experienced the best Chicken Soup of my life in a restaurant near Insadong. Suggest to go with someone local to enjoy the full excitement of the place."
Love this place!,Love coming to this place.. An interesting place to raom around. With many interesting foodies and shops and pubs.
Food & Shopping Lover this is the place :),"Insadong is my Fav place in South Korea. This places is so lively lots of food & Shopping around. By evening they have lots of street food which is out of the world and cheap. You will find lots of skin care product out here. Don't Forget to take your tax free receipt, also many shop doesn't have option of tax free before you buy confirm with them.Cheers!"
Hip to be square,"Pretty hip little place to visit... lots of street vendors, a trick eye museum, cool multilevel shopping center, big crowds on the weekends for dating couples, they even have a poop (shape only) icecream stand. Just a neat little place to go. Parking is horrendous so don't even bother unless you're a crafty parking individual like myself "
"Nice area, especially all the beef restaurant",There's lots of shopping choices though expensive. It's also where you buy your ticket to Nami Island and take the bus from there too. We loved the authentic beef barbeque restaurants which used fresh beef not the marinated version you get in touristy places and overseas.
Lively!,"The best place to shop for souvenir even some people might say Namdaemun offers cheaper price, but I love Insadong more. "
according to me...best neighborhood...,"yes...many art galleries and restaurants, beautiful design shops and beautiful people....go to the artcrafts modern design shops and enjoy..stop by for a coffee at Paris baguette...."
Traditional place,"It's a traditional place selling traditional things which include handmade products (e.g. key chains, pouches, etc) .. there are many shops selling the traditional products and also restaurants selling tasty food and desserts. You can get snacks such as 뚱빵 (ddung bbang - bread that shaped like poop) and 호떡 (hotteok - honeyed bread).. yummy..there is also vegetarian restaurant called Osegyehyang Restaurant,which is located in a hidden corner in Insadong.. the food price are reasonable..worth a try..There will be tourist information staffs walking around the area. They are dressed in red with an 'i' sign printed on the back of their shirt. In case you need to find a place but unable to find, you can approach them. They will provide you with a map and tell you how to go to the place that you wanted to go. Sometimes they will even recommend you where to get nice food within the area. Nice.."
Cultural Array,This is the array where you can enjoy the traditional goods of Korea with nice Korean restaurant and desserts. It was fun and I love the place. You need more than 3 hours to spend every single corners there.
Galore of handmade stuff,"Love the theme of the place, very arty and traditional. You will see many shops selling handmade jewelry, embroidered clothes etc. some of the items are one of the kind and prices are on the high side."
A Heaven for Art/Food/Culture Lovers,"Insadong is in the heart of Seoul and you just can't miss this place if you're in Gyeongbokgung/Gwanghamun/Changdeokgung area. I went to Insadong twice during my visit.The street has many cafes/restaurants offering dishes as low as KRW6000 for a complete dish, vegetarian meals to traditional teas; a variety of street food, Ssamziegil and many other souvenir shops, as well as the National Souvenir Centre - the place to buy authentic and exclusive traditional Korean craftwork. There's everything for everyone there. I spent 2 to 3 hours there shopping for souvenirs, tried some street food and had lunch at one of the restaurants. I'd go there again to experience exotic Insadong :)"
Cool market,A must visit to this market if ur visiting Seoul. You will find all the Korean traditional things and also many restaurants spread in this strip. 
Artistic ,"A place with full of art museum, most artistic place in Seoul, also you can find very traditional items there. Worth to spend a day there."
A long street of traditional Korean goodies,"A great place to come to after visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace or the nearby Bukchon Hanok Village.Good food, traditional restaurants and teahouses. shops and galleries (mostly arty stuff).One special thing about the shops in this area - their shop signs are all written in hangeul (even Starbucks).Check out Ssamziegil too!"
Great artisan market and some great food.,"This is a good place to buy artisan artifacts in Korea. Also found a great restaurant in the vicinity. The prices here are similar to what you find in other more ""underground"" markets around the city. "
Shoppers heaven,This is the place to go if you are after souvenirs and beautiful pieces of traditional Korean arts. Don't forget to explore the side streets as many of them have hidden gems like a paper shop and a place that has lots of chimes. Try the Macaroon ice-cream sandwiches or the funny tubey ice-cream things which are delicious and fun. Try the potato hotdogs while browsing the many stalls both inside and outside the stores.
"Shop for Art, Traditional Souvenir, Unique Cafe & Tea House","shop for galleries, traditional restaurants, traditional teahouses, and cafes.Unique street and building structure. must visit place."
Traditional street,A place which sells many traditional souvenirs and also famous for tea! Famous tea shop osullo is extremely congested n requires reservation before going. Make sure to book before going!
Nice walk and street food,Have been here for a walk. Had some street food and watch the other many tourists. Would recommend the dumpling at a small place in one of the side streets almost at the end of Insadong (going in the direction of the palace).
Blast into the Past,"This street is good for those who want to get a feel for how Korea was in the past. The shops mostly sell traditional crafts, like wooden masks and fans. The area of the city is great for walking, so you can get to other attractions, like City Hall, the palaces, and Myeongdong, without bothering with public transportation. As with most places around Seoul, be ready to fight the crowds. And be aware that things around there tend to close early, around 8 o'clock or so."
Loved it!,"Loved staying in Insadong. The food was super cheap, especially Korean BBQ which was significantly cheaper than other suburbs such as Itaewon. We stayed at 24Guesthouse Insadong which was the perfect central location. "
Shop Wisely !!!,"Tourist Zone (which is a multi storey building alongside the street shops) are premium stuff, tax refundable if u spend more than 30,000KRW, things are nice, but pricey. Good to go during weekdays coz weekends are back to back crowd. "
Amazing shopping area with so much character,"Insadong is a lovely area full of little boutique shops, galleries, food stalls, restaurants, tea houses and much more. My husband and I bought lots of lovely souvenirs and it was nice having a stroll along the streets particularly Ssamji-gil, where there is a shopping mall that spirals upwards. Also look out for a traditional tea house called Sinyetchatjip on the main street. You go up stairs and this is where the tea house is located. Very nice atmosphere and you have to try one of the teas with the traditional rice cakes."
Lovely part of town ,"I adore Insadong with its art galleries, tea houses, coffee places, and wonderful street food and restaurants. Even the touristy shops are kind of cute. Make sure you wander into some of the alleys. If you like dumplings, there is a great mandoo place down one of the side streets. You will see the steam coming from the (tiny) restaurant. Highly recommend this area! "
Great place for souvenirs,Traditional Korean souvenirs and nice to walk around. Get your souvenirs here and then compare the prices when you leave at the shops at the airport. You won't be disappointed! Head to Bukchon nearby to see traditional houses.
Souvenirs!,"If you plan to get souvenirs for the people back home, Insadong is the best place to get them. It's much more cheaper to get them here than other places like Itaewon, Myeongdong etc. It's a very artistic place. So much love here. :)"
Lovely lively area,Lots of very nice shops selling upscale items and a good number of restaurants abound. Some interesting stuff down the side streets too. Worth spending a good hour or two browsing around.
A must shopping destination,"Is a short one lane shopping place but fills with modern and traditional items. Don't just look shop on ground floor. try to explore those basement or 1F / 2F shops and cafes. Start from Jonggak Station (Subway Line 1 Exit 3), walk 250 meter then turn left at the intersection. Or start from Anguk Station (Subway Line 3 Exit 6), walk 100 meter till Tourist Information Booth and turn left."
my fav shopping in seoul,"this was my fav shopping experience in seoul...huge variety of little shops, tea houses, cafes, resturants. Its also a nice place to walk / wander around if you dont want to shop. the best place in seoul to shop for souveniers and home stuff."
A place for tourist..,Insadong was just a walking distance from our hotel n this place was so much alive even at night. Good place to buy souveniers as they were cheaper compared to other places.. Many good restaurants are located here. We went to a vegetarian restaurant named Oh Se Gae Yung and were amazed by their food presentation and taste.. Highly recommended..!
"A pleasant stroll, but nothing spectacular","Consisting of several street blocks of shops and restaurants, its a nice area to wander around. The shops are mostly souvenir type shops. Stop off here on the way back from one of the temples"
Always my favorite shopping/wandering/people-watching/tea-drinking experience in Seoul.,"This is always my favorite shopping experience in Korea. And I mean shopping--not buying (although I almost always do): looking, people-watching, wandering, having a cup of tea or a meal. These pedestrian only few square blocks are full of culturally oriented businesses: tea shops, calligraphy stores, art galleries, ceramic galleries, antique shops and interesting restaurants. I always seem to find what I am looking for. This time I was looking for ceramic gifts I didn't know exactly what I wanted but knew that I would know it when I saw it. And just so!--I walked into a small gallery with a show of unusually fine functional ware and quickly spent too much money, knowing also that my art buyers intuition was well satisfied. It is a wonderful contrast to the mass merchandising appeal of places like the Coex Mall. The one small downside is that in the last few years an influx of Mainland Chinese tourists has produced a market for cheaper stuff and cosmetics and these businesses are beginning to proliferate. I'm hoping that this doesn't progress much further because traditional Korea gets harder and harder to find in general."
Lovely neighbourhood,"Lovely neighbourhood, full of traditional tea houses, restaurants and souvenir shops. Especially in the evenings it gets more crowded."
A lot of interesting shops,You will find a lot of interesting small shops and there are always good or mini mart round the corner for you to rest your feet and fill your stomach.Taking a taxi is pretty easy just make sure you hop on the taxi on the right side of the street if you are heading back to you hotel after your walk around.Plenty of photo taking opportunities if you are into architecture. 
Great place to wander and have lunch,"Michael Kim (ultimatekoreatour@gmail.com) from UltimateKoreaTour proposed to have a free time for lunch in this area. It was a great idea, so people had an opportunity to choose lunch according to preferences and spend rest of the time for shopping and exploring the local culture."
Great scenes and food options,Just wander around and experience the varied options of food and shopping. The street food is particularly exciting - try the Octopus
Compares favorably to Chinese equivalents,"Insadong consists of several city blocks not far from the city center, and other notable tourist sites. There is some great shopping there, and be prepared to negotiate with the vendors. It is like Yu Yuan Gardens in Shanghai, or Jinli Lu in Chengdu - but much bigger. Well worth the experience, and there are several western fast-food restaurants conveniently located nearby. "
Do not miss Insadong,"Insadong is a great place to shop for sourvenirs. There are variety of sourvenirs selling (key chain, bag, fridge magnet etc) and of course skin care / make up products also available. Besides, there are lot of restaurants here. So do not miss Insadong!"
If you need inspiration,"The area where you can find traditional Korean presents, antique and beautiful ink stones. And while you are in the neighborhood visit the 10 story high pagoda in the park where the Declaration of Independence was declared."
Nice design product full of art and cultural elements!,"I enjoyed walking inside the streets. The decoration of the street is nice and you may find it with good street furniture! I spent about half day there, either inside the cafe and shopping!"
Food extravaganza,"Ever imagined snacking away at an ice cream from both sides? Or it being in a j-shaped cone made from corn? Or an ice cream that is 32cm long?! I could go on and on because if you want some crazy food, this is a great place to find it. And if you like crazy good finds to bring home as souvenirs, here is also a good place to indulge. My hot tip is the local shopping mall. Go to the roof first and then meander your way down, checking out all the quirky shops with beautifully handcrafted goods. Art-lovers will love this area too, with interesting statues and shops. How about a mega size painting brush for your calligraphy needs? Whatever your interest, this area is definitely a must see."
Try to visit Ssamziegil,"I really love the ambiance, the cafe and the restaurant looks artsy. Dont forget to visit Ssamziegil, where you can find many shop selling local products. Ssamziegel also has cute graffiti."
Souvenir Shopping,"Great place to buy Korean souvenirs for friends and family, the Pashminas were a hit with mine. Some great artists along here. Super yummy authentic Korean food too."
Many antique store,Many souvenirs stores in insadong and antique store the price is not very high and there is a ice cream store you must try You can stop at anguk station or accros the street from bukchon to insadong after you pass the park you find olive and young on your left cross the red light and you arrive at insadong enjoy your trip...
Artsy and Cozy,"Its a nice, artsy and cozy place. Many Souvenirs and gifts options but Dongdaemun is slightly cheaper.Customised name stamps and korean style bags worth to buy2nd Starbucks shop in Korean word.However a little too early to close as I went at about 8pm most shops already closed."
Souvenirs everywhere!,"Good place to buy souvenirs to take back home. Though I think it was a bit costly compared to the one we saw in Dongnaenum area. And we ate in this restaurant, mainly serving seolleongtang! It was soo good and cheap! Their kimchi was tasty too, the spiciness was just right. Too bad I wasnt able to recall the name! "
Souvenirs,u can find a lot of souvenirs here. And u can find the only Starbucks coffee shop written in Korean word here.
Great for boutique nic nacs,Boutique nic nacs and Korean good. Great for kids although a little kitshcy. Bought a couple of gifts and had a good time
Nice shopping district,Shopping district with plenty of small gift shops and restaurants. Worth to visit day and late evening.
Great nightlife!,"In Insadong zou will find a bar, disco or restaurant what you like. There is plenty of them and also good shopping."
Tourism but still alive,"Found some interesting shops and cafes'. Korean paint, brushes and accessories were bought. A lot of interesting galleries and perfect weather made the visit a really good experience. "
Another women's paradise,"If you want cheaper goods, this is the place to go. Many Korean goods are here and little gifts for your friends back home. It was fun, but I didn't buy anything due to the amount of tour time we had."
Traditional-looking tourist spot,"Hmmmm Insadong is special. Actually it's just a tourist spot with lots and lots of the same traditional Korean souvenirs in every shop. But there are also lots of cool little galleries of Korean artists that you can visit for free. Very enjoyable experience. There are also tea shops and good Korean food, and traditional Korean clothes shops... The atmosphere is nice..."
Too much hype,"I have bought into the hype and went for a visit. It was Saturday and very crowded. Nothing special really, lots of stores selling the same souvenirs and restaurants. The place I have enjoyed the least in Seoul."
Fun to walk through but also very touristy.,I strolled through this district many times during my 2 week trip to Seoul. There are some very interesting shops with ceramics and artwork but they are surrounded by many shops with cheap merchandise so it takes some effort if you are doing serious shopping. There are endless kiosks of street food. Most of it fried dough stuffed w meat. My colleague at snow without problems. There are many restaurants on the side alleys. We picked one that was disappointing. I suggest picking restaurant that don't offer an English menu to get more authentic local food.
Great Shopping,"This is a great place to go for a walk, or to do shopping. I enjoyed looking at all of the art supplies, hand crafted clothes, masks, and other souvenirs. "
Souvenirs and socks,I normally go to Insadong to buy souvenirs. It's a street full of shops and even buy some socks. Super cheap 10 pairs for 5000 won.
Great buy for souvenirs!,"The Insadong street is a lively place for shopping. All the items you can get as souvenirs, something cute and high quality things you can bring back to your family and friends are all in this street. Goodluck and enjoy shopping in this area!"
Lovely place,Stayed in this area so got to know it well. Handy to major sights and small out of the way places. Loved the difference in small alleyways and the food around here is great. 
Insadong = Instant love!,"This hipster street just brings everything in one place! Food, shopping (cheap too!), culture, arts, tourist spots all rolled in one! Don't just visit the street, check out the alleys as well. Hidden there are good cheap restaurants. Allot at least 3-5 hours and immerse yourself in shopping and culture. This is definitely a great place to get lost."
Great place for an evening stroll,Great place for an evening stroll with lots of shops selling both touristy souvenirs and also products from their local artist which are very creative! Ssamziegi building which is located along the road is very well worth a visit for those who are looking for their local artist' work. A must go for those in Seoul!
Korean color,I found the most beautiful hand craft full of Korean classic and new fusion I hiding in here for you to explore.
Seoul trip 2015,It's a very good area traditional places and a very special shops for women latest Korean fashion and excellent quilty Korean made. ..
"Very nice Area to take a stroll, buy some Souvenirs and have a nice dinner","area is very ncie to walk through, int he side ways you can see many of the houses that have the traditional Korean architecture. Some are very old and were built before the 1950s. there are many coffee shops to stop by and also small shops to buy gifts and Souvenirs."
For those who wish to savour local delights,Bustling area for trying local inexpensive Korean food. Many small eateries some are open till late most of them close around 9.30-10pm.
relaxing place,a lot of nice cafes and traditional tea houses. one of the must go place during your trip. i have spent almost half day here to enjoy one of the traditional tea house. MUST try the honey biscuit with the tea. 
Ask a local to take you elsewhere.,Wonderful for going for a cup of traditional tea but go elsewhere for shopping. Best to ask the info desk or if you have a Korean friend then ask them to take you somewhere cheaper.
A walking Street,A nice and easy walking /shopping street. Most people went there for shopping. A lot of tourists (as with all malls in Seoul)
Best craft items and gift shopping..,I been Seoul twice and both times i went Insadong area many many times. Merchants have a good collectible art items and price are very reasonable. Many cheap gift stores and many local food restaurants. 
a decent place to find tea,"I'm crazy about tea, and this seems to be the one place to find it in Seoul. It's not so easy to find the ideal types of small shops one would look for (Google doesn't know about many, at least based on an English search), so the best plan might be to give up a day just wandering. I found two shops selling tea, and many more cafes that looked interesting, and it seemed a nice older neighborhood besides that."
Get your Celadon here,"I was able to find the most reasonably priced celadon vases here. They have lots of traditional goodies for you to bring home. Hint: if you go further in away from the shops which line the main streets, you can find the same items for a much cheaper price."
Good walking street but little variety,"Just another shopping walking street but offer less varieties than Myeongdong, Hongdae, GotoMall in terms of goods sold and food. But this is a great place to take a stroll."
Overpriced restaurants,"Seriously, eat elsewhere and drink elsewhere. Most restaurants are tourist traps. You can eat for better elsewhere at a lower price. "
A beautiful quarter in Seoul,"We had the most delightful time in this very special part of Seoul. Full of trendy art galleries, artisanal stands , but also typical ceramic, wood and silk shop. A lot of Korean food restaurants. Worth a 4-5 hours leisure time in Seoul."
Intriguing and full of life,"We walked down this street both during the day and night, both times it was full of life. At night buskers came out and during the day is when all of the shops are open for exploration. There are a lot of touristy shops with plenty of souvenirs to buy, as well as hand made jewelry. There are some interesting little desert stalls as well where they make unfamiliar ice creams."
Definitely visit,This was my favorite part of Seoul. I liked the feel of the streets and if you stray from the main road a bit you an see some small homes where people live. There would be nightly performances from singers. 
loved it,Like the crowded shops full of arts and the side alleys with restaurants. Not a place for kids. We started on the north side and worked our way down to Chongno.
Center of Seoul,"Great for traditional food and souvenir shopping. Make sure to visit plenty of souvenir shops before buying, some have the same things and you might find better prices down the road."
Pleasant Shopping Street,Many things to shop around and many restaurants in the area. Many coffee shops. Better to come on Sunday for the free market. Many food stalls.
Best tourist location,This part of town has the best location for walking or taking a short subway ride to most of the tourist attractions in Seoul. Plus the traditional shops and alleys add an authentic touch compared to the big modern malls/shops.
AN INTRICATE MAZE OF DELIGHTFUL DISCOVERIES,"Insa-dong is truly an exciting neighborhood . Every time I visit Korea , we stayed in this area.I am fascinated by the quaint tiny shops that displayed various merchandise both traditional and trendy . Unlike malls which are basically similar globally , these little shops are refreshing to explore - some offer ceramic products , handmade clothes and souvenirs. Above all the number of art shops and other exquisite Korean made things are found here . The little alley ways are delightful to explore and you can never expect what to discover. I stumbled upon an art exhibition venue which was really amazing and met a renowned artist Lee Young-Suk who graciously consented to have our photo taken by her son . That was a very special moment for me . Besides , you will be spoiled by the number of traditional restaurants in Insa-dong. Don't miss out on all these and more ."
Fun Avenue of Shops and Food Stalls,"Insadong is THE place for souvenirs although many of the stores had pretty much the same inventory. If you want more local artist made high end souvenirs, make a stop at Ssamzeigil (four floors of handcrafted items) which is around the midpoint of Insadong. You can also take a break at O'sulloc, a modern tea house that is also the largest tea company in Korea. And of course they had nicely packaged tea which made great souvenirs. "
Good place to visit but choose wisely,"What I like is the street itself, the environment especially earlier in the morning when there's no crowd yet. Lots of souvenir shops. I like the restaurants at the back alley, they're pretty good, except for one restaurant, nearest to the Insadong Station/ Tourist Info Booth. Its traditional entrance look good but the ginseng chicken ain't fresh!"
Must visit,"Great area for arts and crafts shopping, and souvenirs! If the weather is good, it's a great walk, as the main street is closed to cars between 10am and 10pm."
A fun place to visit,"One of the must-go places in Seoul so I went and I liked it. There were some very interesting masks and foods to try as well as a multi level shopping area. The only thing was that it was very touristy and felt like the whole thing was just catered to tourists. Although fun to visit, it can be a little disappointing in some ways. "
Traditional and contemporary local experience,"Lots of small traditional handcraft shops from wooden accessories, paper goods, painting, ceramic, mirrors and lots more. A trendy shopping complex for more local artwork and restaurants. Do not miss the tea houses for traditional korean tea which is good for health."
Loved it,Insadong is like stepping back in time. Great neighborhood market shopping and browsing. Also great people watching.
Culture rich,"Lots of little quaint shops for you to shop around in for unique handicrafts and souvenirs. Come here for the experience of wearing a hanbok! The selection of hanboks are not as many as professional studios, but they are free for trying."
Cozy and calm,"Сozy streets, comfortable to walk, with many famous restaurants and cafe, small shops. The people are friendly and smiling."
Great area,Great place for souvenirs. There is nice mall towards the middle that has a cute couples place at the top. At the end of the street there are great and tasty food carts. 
Lovely area,"Please make sure to visit this place during the day. Unfortunately, we were there at the evening and didn't have enough time to see all of those little shops. Osulloc is worth a Jeju tea time experience."
I just love this area of Seoul.,"I have traveled many times to Seoul and have enjoyed many of the cultural jewels of this city and some of the wonders of the surrounding area. But I am always drawn back to Insadong even just for a quick visit. It is a quirky shopping area and artsy district. Lots of good restaurants, and the best tourist information professionals in the city. Really a fun day just to walk and look and pause for coffee and food. Enjoy."
Great area to wander around and enjoy,"Insadong is a great area to stay, it is full of character giving plenty of opportunity to walk around with lots of different shopping experiences of a national type. Some great restaurants for vegetarians are available. The locals are very helpful and friendly, giving a great feeling of safety We also found it easy to get to use the train station nearby to explore further."
art town of korea,"There are lots of shops that sell arts and crafts besides souvenirs, be it modern or traditional. I spent about 3 hours there and it was far than enough. I only got to go to a few shops.. but I bought the most here in Insadong compared to other places. One particular thing I like about Insadong is the small alleys. This is where rows of small restaurants and eateries that cater to the locals working around Insadong, but yes they do serve foreigners as well, if you dont mind communicating in different languages with the ahjummas shoptenders."
Neat crafts and people,"Great shopping area to get a more traditional Korea shopping experience. Nice nicnacs and souvenirs are here, lots of crafts. Good place to people watch and close to Changdeokgung and Jogyesa."
"2 Visits, very lovely","Insadong is where most of my gift shopping took place, but the area offers fantastic restaurants, traditional tea houses, street food that takes on a performance art flair and friendly shopkeepers! Bargain hunters can score here if thery're mindful, as many items that experience a high markup in fancy tourist shops can be found in humble street stalls for considerably less. Not to be missed!"
Good place to shop for Korean souvenir,most of the shops selling similar gifts/souvenirs. Try sample street food along the way. A good way to discover new local dishes.
Wonderful Street to Visit,"This is a street with multiple side streets that all sell handicrafts. Came here first as part of a day tour, but returned on my own after 5 hours at one of the palaces Great combo for a full day."
Typical tourist pedestrian mall,"ok, the trinkets were Korean, but this could be any tourist souvenir street in the world, crowded, sort of tacky, with cheap trinkets and over-priced clothes and ""art"" to take home. This should be the last place on your list of Seoul sites to see."
Great street food and atmosphere,"this was a fun area to walk around, find some great local food (go to where there are crowds of locals rather than tourists) and have a few drinks, snacks or a full meal. It is more fun venturing into the smaller alleys for interesting food and drink venues though plenty of activity, stalls (and tourists) along the main streets"
Where everyone seems to go,"This is the lively shopping/food street that comes alive at night. It is a real tourist trap but is great fun. There is plenty to see and do with lots of restaurants, usually upstairs. Try some of the street food - beware it can be very spicy, try the walking cane shaped ice creams from a shop, peeled curly fried potatoes on a stick from a street stall or buy some of the wonderful hand made paper and envelopes that would cost a fortune back home. Maybe catch a performance on the outdoor stage at the top of the street. It is also quite lively during the day."
Must visit for the teahouses,"Insa-dong is perfect for walking and enjoying the small shops which sell arts, crafts,and most importantly tea shops and houses.There are small alleys where the older tea houses sit. Very cute and unexpectedly calm amidst busy Seoul.For cratfs, there are options, from as low as 2000won or USD2 for a fabric phone pouch and mini mirror to the hundreds of dollars worth of handmade bag."
Find Your Souvenirs Here,"You can find all souvenirs for families here. Broad range of choices from traditional to modern souvenirs. For unique mall experience, try Ssamziegil, this unique mall was designed in such a way by connecting its charming alleys in the form of a spiral-like stairway. The alleys are decorated with murals."
Cultural/Traditional,Concept here seems to be more cultural/traditional. This can be seen from the products sold here.Anyway this is another nice different Korean street market concept to experience. There is a shopping mall as well. 
Ms Darla Menkee Buff,"Insadong - What a fabulous taste of Korean culture. Fashion, cuisine, crowds, noise and a fabulous mixture of smells. I highly recommend enjoying a lengthy walk through the quaint streets of Insadong."
Excellent food and shopping variety,Very good options when it comes to authentic Korean food and reasonable priced shopping. Worth checking out.
A nice Walk around,"For traditional celadon and other market materials, or for a temple meal (as we did), this is a great area an easy to get to and from. Although lots of tourists, also lots of locals. We passed so many locals with cups of their coffee from their favorite coffee shops it became a bit much, but a real picture on contemporary Korea."
ok,"If you happen to be nearby, just stroll along the road. It is a nice place to see some arts, and unique stuffs on sale. A lot of korean foods too. "
The best place in town,"I loved it her, grate food good shoping lots o places to see. Get to know this place, and find youre favorit place to eat. There are so many places to choose from. A must see in Seoul"
Highly recommended!,"Good place to eat Korean food, shop for souvenir and experience Korean culture like dressing up in Hanbok."
More for the architectures and probably a cuppa!,"Insadong is flooded with cafes and some diners. The retail shops there are fancier (more to the higher-end but really limited choices). I went there just to sit by the window of a cafe, enjoying a cup of hot coffee and admiring the architectures. Snapping a few pics too. Insadong is the lower part of Bukchon Hanok Village. Therefore you can see the beautiful structures of hanoks climbing high up the mountain."
Tourist Central,"ok, this is that part of town that exists in every city. There are dozens of stores all selling the same ""handmade"" crafts usually at prices higher than anywhere else. The whole area is really about 3 blocks long and it does have all your requisite touristy things to buy. There are also a lot of street food vendors and restaurants. "
Ditto everyone else,"Insadong is touristy but there are some great spots to go shopping. There are small stores that sell random things like lithographs of old maps and a small mall that is like a physical etsy-type place where people hand make the items they sell. And there are lots of places that sell things made in China. But all in all, it's a great place to hang out -- but know that it gets super crowded and if you like a quiet wander, you're not going to get that in Insadong (particularly on the weekends and during peak travel seasons like Chinese New Year, March, summer, winter)... despite its kitschiness, I still love hanging out in Insadong. :)"
Good Place to try Korean Food,I was there 11:30 am. The place was quiet. Maybe it's more active at night. There's a lot of nice typical Korean restaurants around. I tried the vegetarian Bibimbap. It was not greasy and tasted delicious. Only few shops are selling Korean food. There are a lot of shops around. It looks the same as other tourists places.
Great local food and items ,"Insadong is a place where you can find local food and items. Great food at affordable prices. If you want to try something local, i recommend to go to Insadong. "
Best place for gifts,Insadong is full of small shops selling mostly tasteful gifts. It's close to Jongno 3-Ga station. Why not walk through it up to Anguk station?
A modern ancient town,"Check out the small alleys and you'd find gems in there, from restaurants to cafes to handicraft shops!"
Good place for souvenirs but opens around 10 or 10:30 am,"There are many fun little shops in this area to buy souvenirs but beware buying products made in China. Make sure if you buy souvenirs that they are made in Korea. Shops don't start opening here until about 10 or 10:30 am. It is definitely a touristy area, but still fun."
Foodie Paradise,Insadong is a very nice area with a lot of great food and shops. If you are a foodie like me then you will love it. It had cakes in the shape off poo stuffed with red bean! Rice cakes with organic honey! green tea ice cram! and a lot of other delicious foods. There are also a few shops around there. 
My favorite!,"I love this place. It's now a favorite! i bought almost all of my souvenirs here, so affordable! The stores & boutiques are also very stylish. :)"
A funky place with a great vibe,"Headed here on a Sunday afternoon, the place was filled with locals and the local markets. The main street was busteling with people really good vibe. We thought about trying to photo bomb every selfie we saw but would never have gotten out of the place.There are heaps of shops, stalls, galleries and places to eat. Highly worthwhile for any trip to soul. "
Great Spot for Shopping!,"I really enjoyed all the little shops here. I liked Ssamziegil. It is a great place where people sell things they have made themselves. In addition, there are areas downstairs where you can create your own art. The place itself has various sculptures and artwork around. The young Koreans use this place for selfie mania - or at least they did while I was there. :)"
Fun street market/ Lots of clothes and food,We did not buy anything..as we had 2 weeks of travel ahead of us and no space to carry but lots of stuff you could buy and lots of food you could try which we did/
Average old-style tourist street,"Insa-dong is a nice set of streets and alleys with various shops selling souvenirs. It is not hugely different to any other such area in East Asia and you can find the same kind of stuff they sell there in almost any of the neighbouring countries. Having said that, it is a nice area and worth visiting."
A traditional tea house - next to famous dumpling shop,"I chanced upon this traditional house which have a tea house in second level and a local craft and pottery level at the first level. There is English name for this tea house. If you find the famous dumpling alley. It is just next to it. I truly enjoy the ambiance and the tea, the display and the small and exclusive space for having a good afternoon tea. Must visit if you are tired after walking around Insadong. "
Beautiful Pedestrian Mall,This is a nice street on which to stroll with handicraft and antique shops as well as many eateries.
plenty of souvenir shops,"at Insadong you can buy plenty of souvenirs for good prices, but don't miss the Garden tea house, they offer amazing tea, full of flavor, a heaven for tea lovers!"
Bit artificial.,"Well, I heard signature place in Seoul for foreigners. For souvenir better than airport. But little more expansive than other place. I don't exactly what is real Korean sentiment."
"Nice walks, lots of bric a brac","This street is popular, safe, a bit touristy, but interesting. I would recommend a couple passes through during your time in Seoul. The restaurants offer lots of the ""must-try"" dishes of Korea and there are a scattering of traditional shops with seals, brushes and carvings that are more interesting sights than the imported Chinese bags and Korea magnets. Lots of smells to smell."
"Shop 'til you drop, then stop for some tea","A shopper's delight, wander along the main drag for souveniers, pottery, crafts. Don't neglect the side streets where more shops and wonderful little tea houses and restaurants can be found."
"Arts, crafts and souvenirs",So this is where you are going to find any tourists in town! It's a great street filled with all manner of small shops selling local crafts and souvenirs. There are also a number of art and craft boutiques to visit which are worth the trip. 
Good place to walk on saturday afternoon,"Don't go there to shop, I think this is not the right place for antiques, most of them are fake from CHINA , or there are not affordable. I have lived 5 years next to INSADONG and the transformation of the district shows a trend towards more Art galleries, restaurants, and trendy stores. Clearly the ""antiques"" aspect is getting lost, if it has been there in the first place, however I am not so sure. You go there to see the korean couples hanging around in cafe, visit the galleries, have a free TCHA (Green Tea) at the Tea factory and finish by a visit of the shopping center not for buying (I never bought anything there) but for the eccentric architecture and excentric shops. After 7pm, there is not much you can do there, and you should head toward JONGNO or even ITAEWON for a drink (s)"
Great place to get sourveniors,"I recommend this place for souvenirs shopping. Surrounded by good restaurants, unique shopping, and nice coffee shop to spent your lovely afternoon!"
Street of Korea art and fashion,"Many tourists and young korean people are shopping here. It is a combination of Korean tradition, culture and modern life style. Art galleries and souvenir shops are everywhere."
Great market,"One advise: Do not visit this place during summer in the noon. The hotness is unbearable. Sweating like crazy. However, this place has many things you can buy to bring home for your loved one. The price is medium I think, since i've tried namdaemun and it's not really that much different."
Trendy shopping in Seoul,"Insadong is the place to shop in Seoul if you want antiques and high-fashion goods. Accordingly, it is pricier than Namdaemoon or Itaewon. But you will find quality, trendy goods here that you likely will not find in the other two places. "
Don't see what the fuss is about,"After reading all the other reviews on this place, it was highly recommended... but I didnt feel like it was worth the bother. The staff they sell here can be found cheaper at other shopping locations. "
Last place in Seoul for tourist shopping,"I used to shop for souvenirs in Itaewon, but those days are gone. Insadong has good shopping and a great experience overall. The street food options are very good, and the shops have all quality levels of Korean souvenirs."
BUSY but fabulous place on a Saturday night,"I spent a Saturday evening wandering around Insadong and fell even more in love with Seoul. It's definitely commercial and more modern (than, say, the palaces) but I didn't find it at all touristy. Especially if you're up for trying out street food, watching street performers and just generally enjoying the crowd. It became so busy that it was practically wall to wall people most of the evening, and you'll want to be mindful of your space and belongings but the vibe is like a street party and I found it to be a lot of fun. Most of the shops were selling reproductions or trinkets, I found the people, food and general scene to be more of the attraction than the shops. "
perfect place to get some souvenirs and hotteok!,"situated near Jongno-gu, Gwanghwamun and Bukchon, it's a street filled with souvenir shops, street vendors and restaurants! It's also filled with tourists as there's a few tourism offices around if you wish to take a day trip somewhere outside of Seoul, there's organized buses and tours to take you to main attractions outside of the city! This is the place to buy themed socks for friends, posters, unique Korean gifts and try on the traditional Korean robes! As for hotteok, it's a traditional Korean pancake with a sweet filling, it's perfect for a cold fall/winter day while strolling on the streets of Insadong :)"
Visit the tea houses here!,"For a unique Korean experience, vist a tea house in this area of Seoul. Quite comfortable and relaxing."
Waist of time!!!,Insadong is totally not worth it in my opinion. It has changed a lot since my first visit in 2009. I went back recently with my parents to show them around and almost had a heart attack. Not much originality left. Chain coffee shops and snack shops all over the place. Very disappointed.
Cheap3!,"Practically I recommend this place for souvenirs shopping! *Thumbs up*!!Plus, it is near my hotel too.. we just walked there to shop. Really miss this place."
Fun Street to Shop and Eat,"Lots of great street food vendors, cute souvenirs and really good restaurants. Wear comfortable shoes as you will be walking a lot and parts of the street are cobblestone."
Awesome Hood,"Love it, good restaurants, unique shopping, all blended in traditional and current day Korea. Gorgeous during the summer, late spring and early fall"
Shopping,"Close to Anguk station and the Metro. If you want to do some craft shopping this is the place. It took us about 1.5 hours to traverse the main shopping road, which is lined with many shops selling all sorts of traditional goods from Jewellery to bags hats and clothes.If you need to get gifts to take home this a good place to go."
A little bit of everything,"The area is more upscale than the likes of Itaewon. The restaurants seemed new, and there is an emphasis on art and culture in the shops. Pleasant atmosphere."
Artsy street,"I really love Insadong. It gives a different vibes compared to Myeongdong or Itaewon as there are unique feels to it. When I went there, there are a lot of art exhibition and buskers on the streets. If I went to Seoul I would definitely go to Insadong again."
Souvenirs for you tourists!,"Do you want tchotchkes to take home to your family as proof that you went to Korea? Here is one of many places that you can go to to do that! I, on the other hand, don't like those things. I don't have a trophy case full of items from places I've visited. I would normally have steered clear of this, but our tour guide brought us here (because most tourists like shopping at these types of venues). No thanks."
Not crowded but shipping for the tourists. ,Enjoyed the vendors and numerous shops. One negative is that many of the shops are the same stuff repeated. But worth the stop for any one visiting Seoul. 
Great place to walk through.,Insadong is a nice neighborhood that has an artsy feel to it. One of the Alive museums are here as well as the Ssamziegil shopping area. Many food vendors and souvenir shops are in this area. Some galleries and calligraphy stores can be found here.
Over Hyped,"Found this to be just a pedestrian street with all the same shops, vendors, and hawkers one could find elsewhere in Seoul. Sorry, but I failed to see why so many people recommend visiting this area."
The Soul of Seoul,"Insadong is a must for any traveler in Seoul on whatever timeline. Rich with history and low standing houses, it is a time capsule in the the middle of a city overwhelmed by glass, concrete and steel. Try rice cakes from a street vendor, of a bean desert in the shape of a fish. Many restaurants available and the Korean barbecue there is out of site. Do it. "
So much to see and eat,A great street market. I ate so much street food and bought a few souvenirs. Just thinking about it makes me hungry for more of the street food. Korea is filled with street markets though and I think this one had the most food available. 
Touristy streets with variety of shops and galleries,"This is a highly touristy street, but there are many galleries that you might want to check out because of their high qualities. There are also shops of higher qualities everywhere in-between shops selling cheap stuff. Do check out Tong'in gage!"
insadong,"Funky district of seoul with great street food and arts scene. The live museum is not to be missed, get in the picture! Good shopping for pottery and fun gifts for back home"
traditional gift shopping street,"You can buy some traditional gift on this street. Not so crowded. on the night, you can enjoy walking and try the street food."
Nice walking street,Lots of restaurants in the small alleys. Many shops selling local souvenirs. Very pedestrian friendly. Close to Cheongdeokung (exit 6 from the subway). 
First choice to visit in Seoul,"This is the perfect place to hang out if you have a stop over of few hours in Seoul. Artworks, gifts, food, architecture, everything in one place. Just take the subway.There is a main street full of stores and restaurants, but you should try also the narrow alleys for real local food. Prices are totally affordable and there are tourist officers to guide you.Not all people speak English but finally you can get what you want with some gestures."
Selll lots of cheap things,You can get your Korean Style chopstick and spoon here! Its more like a souvenir place. Also had my ginseng chicken porridge here! worth a visit but not a must!
Insa-dong,"You can feel the Korean culture in the street particularly along the Ssamziegil (gil means street in Korea). There are many shops (to buy traditional souvenir), café, restaurants (Korean style). It is worth while to look around. It is also located in the walking distance (10 min) from Gyeongbokgung palace. You can see both place at a time."
"Busy, crowded, but should not be missed","It's a pretty cool place, lots of touristy things to buy, prices vary on some things from store to store, so you should look around. We had no issues after eating a few versions of the street foods offered, best to come and go via the subway as parking is scarce and expensive."
Special place where you can feel traditional Korean culture.,There are many interesting shops which sells old or traditional stuffs. Also there are many restaurants and also many different places to drink a cup of tea. Normally so many people are here as the other popular places.
I visit Insadong once a month or every two months,Really cool souvenirs and presents to buy. There's always a street performance and tons of art galleries. The food at the restaurants is incredible!
Inferior market in Seoul,this market was not one of my favourites. The array of food stall and options was not as big as I had expected and the souvenir stores are overpriced and the uncomfortable to be in because of sales people breathing down your neck.It does stand out and offer more traditional shops and tea houses which is pretty cool.
Fun to visit,Great so much fun. Visit the 4 story artists mall. Everything in the stores had made by the artists. we went twice back while in Seoul.
Tourist spot,"A tourist spot,great for a walk around ,with plenty of restaurants.Currency exchange rate is much more better than airport.Was there 3/19/2014"
Come for the galleries,"We had a stroll here around lunch time and had some food, after the Bukchon Village which is just north. I would not recommend this area for shopping and it is definitely not a market. There are some tourist shops with the usual souvenirs, but you can get them cheaper at Namandeum.This neighborhood is famous for its around 100 galleries. if you are into art, new, mordern, Korean traditional, this is the right place to have a look. We did not buy anything, so I cannot say anything about the prices.There are also some places where you can dress up with the traditional Korean clothes and have a photo taken. And the Alive Museum is a fun place to take some great photos.You can grab an english map for Insadong at the small tourist information stalls."
not so cheap market,"insadong maybe is known as a sovenir market but the goods here cannot be said cheaper then anywhere else and neither can you bargainover to myeong dong , dongdaemun or namdaemun for the sovenir shopping purpose."
Easy market to start with in Seoul.,"Neat shopping area with food, boutiques, and tourist souvenir junk. Still worth a go for the people watching and food options."
Tourist Trap Buyer Beware,"Save your money, take a 10 minute taxi or bus ride and go to Namdaemun Market, they have the same products and MORE to offer for half the price. Ever since this place was officially deemed a landmark/tourist area by the Korean government back in 2002/2003 (don't remember exactly), all the prices doubled overnight!"
"Maybe Not the Most Authentic Korean Experience, But Still a Must See","Insadong is kind of a strange area because while it is very touristy and definitely geared towards tourists, there are still some interesting and very korean experiences to be had if you know how to find them.This is definitely one of the best areas for souvenirs. You can find everything up and down this street from typical cheap magnets, etc all the up to some very high quality ceramics and art. There is one stall on the left close to beginning of the strip if walking from Anguk station selling beautiful printed scrolls that is well worth a look.Also, while I think the quality of most of the restaurants in this area is pretty low and geared towards tourists, tucked away in the back streets are some very traditional and high class (and very very expensive) restaurants. They might be a little hard to access if you don't speak any Korean at all, but they still can be found.Speaking of food, if you walk to the end of Insadong-Gil torwards Jonggak station there is a TON of Korean street food to be had, especially at night. You should definitely continue down to the end here and sample some things. This is one of the better variety's of street food around, and of course the prices are all usualy a couple of dollers per item.All in all I would tell anyone coming to Seoul that you should definitely go here for souvenirs and it is worth exploring some of the side streets and sampling the street food. However, I would probably opt for restaurants in other areas."
Known as art street.,Nice place to visit. There are dozens of art galleries and shops that selling art there. You can easily see some street performers performing on street. This is the place that i am sure you would love to check out if you like cultures and arts.
Art street in Seoul,"Tons of things in this street. High quality souvenir shops, museums, cafe, traditional food & dessert shops, handicrafts, etc. Also have 2 branches of ""Trick Eye Museum"" (Alive Museum) as well."
Great shopping. Ok food,Found an artisan mall. With a store called one of a kind. Worth the whole trip!! The quality in all the shops in that particular mall was outstanding!!
Great for an afternoon out,"Insadong is great for a walk around museums and shops. However, the shop prices are vastly inflated and you can buy for cheaper elsewhere. Do try to haggle, as the prices are always negotiable, and should be. Also, around that area the food is pretty poor compared to other areas, and once again is way overpriced. But, it's a great spot to have a walk around and always has street performers throughout the day. "
Chill Place not Crowded as Myeongdong,Located South East of Gyeongbokgung Palace by walk about 15 minute; These small alley are the place for entertaining out; souvenir shoppingand local food drinking and taste. Many vendor shop at the end south of the streetwhere they sell twisted powder fried dipped with vanilla cream on top; a salty poatatoes fried ; Squid grilled stick etc. key chain; talisman;korean mask souvenir card also along the whole street.
Insadong again!,"If you want tradition, visit Insadong! You will see different shops selling traditional items and souvenirs. And if you are an artists, visit this place. A must if you want to know more about Korea's tradition and culture. This is very near to Gyeongbokgung palace and Gwangjang market!"
my favorite part of the city!,it's the place to go for anything that's more traditional and for things that are made in Korea. a lot of traditional tea houses and cafes to choose from. still has the old charm left.
It is an okay place but a bit over rated,"If you are not familiar with Korean cultural stuffs, perhaps this will give you a glimpse, but don't expect anything authentic. A lot of souvenirs are from China and there are few exhibit stores but pricy.I wouldn't recommend to buy Korean cultural arts here but foods are generally good and the area is very interesting to see.Also, there are several other landmarks are near by, so explore the area and stop at a cafe for a good Korean tea, you will be very happy. "
Delightful,"At first glance, Insadong looks more touristy than it is. There are lots of small, independent cafes, street food vendors, art galleries and shops. It's worth taking a whole afternoon to sample everything and explore all the nooks and crannies."
Back to history in Modern Seoul,"Dynamic, full of fun, tasty and much more. Should not miss!!!"
Too busy,"If you like the fast track and touristy rush, this is the place for you. But if you want a quiet, traditional Korean experience, get out of Seoul and visit a market in a smaller city."
Quite an interesting place to visit)),Very Korean and full of foreigners. Loved its traditional atmosphere!
Stay in this area if you can,"I stayed @ a great Korean Homestay (courtyard house) in this area and could not have been happier with my choice.With plenty to see around (Multiple Palaces) & fantastic food along Insadong-gil, always alot going on on here."
Interesting set-up,It's an interesting touristy place to visit in Seoul if you are bored of shopping and eating. They have a lot of independent shops set up by local artists - you can get some unique souvenirs here. 
Shopping YES!,Don't be afraid by the big labels around here; we were really surprised by the bargains on clothing to be had here. Now how i wished we had allocated more time for shopping in Seoul as I had no idea that we could have done so well on clothing with brand names!
Breezy walk,"Its my favourite place to shop for local handicrafts, art or clothings of Korea. Numerous shops to browse to compare prices. Its ok to bargain at the end if you buy many. There are many local korean restaurants to try too. Walk way is wide just for pedestrians. "
all souvenir types can be found here,It is a famous market selling souvenirs for tourists. There are a lot of shops providing Korean the souvenirs with a good price. We just walk along pedestrian ways and stop in any shops we want. Sometimes you have to bargain to get the price right.We can enjoy the vibrant of the city life by walking in this area at night.
Art Street,"Insadong us a very touristy place, to the point that some of the sellers may even speak your language, in order to stand out and attract customers from all over the globe. Souvenirs shops and art galleries are aplenty, with prices more premium than other areas in Seoul like Namdaemun. However, interesting art stuff can be found here, mostly what seemed like Korean made products, rather than China ones. Whether it is worth it to spend an hour or two here, depends on whether or not you are into discovering art stuff. If yes, be prepared with the crowd especially during late evening."
Arts and Vintage stuff,"Great place to buy souvenirs and to see cute korean stuff at Ssamziegil. There are also a lot of street food stands at the end of the street where we spent most of our time eating out hearts out. Anguk Station, Exit 6 head straight for about 5 minutes to Insadong."
Delicious,"This ex-pat center is a little pricey. However, we found some of the best restaurants while there. There is a lawyer themed restaurant and a tex mex restaurant where the food is amazing."
Nothing special,"Lots of souvenirs and art shops, and things are quite expensive! But you can still visit it, lots of restaurant too, tried their dumpling wasn't really good for me."
Lively street,"The whole stretch of the street is where you will find small quaint shops, restaurants and souvenir shops. This is where we bough souvenirs before going home since its our last stop going to the airport. He had lunch there in one restaurants located in an alley which was a traditional korean house."
"Interesting artsy area, but nothing super special","Insadong has a lot of souvenir and art shops, as well as Korean restaurants. If you know a good place to eat, this is a place. However, it's nothing really special as an area."
Too highly rated,its not so ancient anymore. But still worth a visit. Got some cute buys.Can use the seoul city tour bus (hop on hop off) to go there.
"Great place for snacks, food and souveniors.","Insadong is a must visit if you are a souvenir hunter, and all things touristy, whether to eat, wear or bring home as gifts. There are some good eateries along the streets, on the main stretch, in the hidden side or back lanes particularly Korean eateries where you can have your bibimbap or bulgogi dishes, all with kimchi,, side dishes and rice or noodles. Lots of local and foreign tourists and this would be on your itinerary if you are on a package tour.If you are game, try the poop pie at he ground level of the 3 storey complex where you can find loads of souveniers and novelty (to us foreigners) food! There is washroom somewhere toward the middle, otherwise you would need to patronise a restaurant to be able to use a toilet"
Great Windowshopping,I bought some great art there and souveniors. They were probably more expensive than other places but it was close to where I stayed. Ssamzie-gil is fun and you can send a free photo e-card to your friends or get a photo in traditional clothes for a fee.
A place for souvenirs,I found that the price are cheaper than other places even though they were still expensive but hey dont be so stingy for loved ones. 
My favorite place in Seoul,"This is probably my favorite places to go shopping and dining in Seoul. Its fun to people watch and look for pottery and souvenir. Watch out for the street and alley antique shops and peddlers since 99% of what they sell are reproduction and not real antiques. You will love their traditional stationery and paper shops. Also, great alley restaurant with authentic korean food. At the end of the insadong road is the buddhist temple and the prince palace so you can hit three places in one long walk. allow about 1 to 2 hours to explore and experience the areas until you hit your next destination."
Lovely items in various price ranges,"The shop keepers were in general friendly and not pushy, and many spoke English; the staff in inns and eating places did not always, but they were always helpful.Insane-dong is a peaceful area to enjoy."
A gem for traditional souvenirs,"I love Insadong. Have been there a few times and each time I go I find something new to adore, to look at. Full of charming alleys with hanok restaurants and lots and lots of street food to try if you prefer that. There is a Starbucks there, and other coffee shops are near by. On the main strip there are various types or restaurants both Korean and non. I have ate at their Traditional Korean porridge chain - Bonjuk, which was great. I also at a Indian restaurant located upstairs and while the decor was fantastic, the food itself was awful. I had nice dessert at a tradional bingsu shaved ice place and ate ""ddong-waffle"" poop shaped waffle with chocolate inside. I shopped at a ceramics store and got some great deals from a vendor whose has sort of an open concept store. Bought some cups and spoons for friends and family back home. I also went to the hanbok - korean clothes Photo session with visiting friends and wouldn't recommend it. It is way too overpriced, the woman who owns the place was rude and wouldn't allow us to take pictures for most of the time. Aside from that, I absolutely love Insadong and would recommend it to everyone. Lots of Korean bbq restaurants, korean souvenirs with fair prices. Will be back."
Quaint place with interesting hidden gems,"I came to this place on a beautiful Sunday afternoon as according to the weather forecast it will snow on later afternoon, so I spent about 2 hours here before heading to Samcheongdong for the beautiful snowing scene. Do not walk along the Main Street of Insadong, you have to be adventurous enough to walk into those small lanes where there have nice little cafe and shops and some graffiti. Before I headed to Samcheongdong it had start snowing and Insadong is a nice place to enjoy snow walking, the crowd on Sunday just perfect and I like Paris Croissant cafe and Starbuck in this area cos the interior for these 2 cafes are unique."
Nice collection of atniques and souvenirs,"Loved this place. Has a little bit of everything, clothes, souvenirs, food. Good for tourists but a little of the expensive side. "
great area,"this place is great if you want to get a trendy authentic korean feel. great for shopping too. If you have time or just want to walk around, this is a great place to go to."
Good for a walkabout,"Personally did not find anything particularly exciting here, but due to the proximity to my hotel, it was a nice place to stroll around and see what the little shops lining the streets had to offer."
Seoul's Art & Entertainment District,"If you are visiting or live in Korea, and you love ART, this is the place to GO! Galleries, shops, live music, restaurants, street vendors etc. The cultural atmosphere was great! If I go back to Korea, a visit to Insadong is way up there in my ""Things to do"" list!"
Good souvenir shopping and street food,The place is full of small stores and stalls for small souvenirs as well as Korean delicacies. We are fortunate to pass by here while having our way to Alive museum. There is a small restaurant called Insadong restaurant where we have our lunch. The place is cozy and affordable.
Great place to shop!!,It is an amazing place to shop if you know where to go. Yes there are some shops that are a bit to expensive but also a lot of shops that are cheap. Ok Hongdae is cheaper as an example but still great. Sinsa is way more expensive. So if you like the middle way and also enjoy the palace and Bukchon Village this is an amazing day to do.
history street near the gwanghwamun and gongbukgeoung,history street near the gwanghwamun and gongbukgeoung palace. food here is cheaper compared to myeongdong
"Known for antiques, but nice trendy feel","The recent visit makes me feel the streets has been revived and gave me a pleasant trendy feel. TIP : To visit, take Line 3 and alight at ANGUK #328 subway station."
Traditional Shopping but can be a bit pricey,This is a great place to go to get souvenirs or more traditional Korean crafts and art. There are tons of different options for you to find the perfect Korean gift for everyone. But.....it tends to be a little pricey.
For tourists,"We got there quite easily on the subway. There is heaps of things specifically designed for tourists, so if you want something authentic then this is not the shopping for you. Saying that though, we picked up some great things ad quite reasonably priced too."
"Not as ""artistic"" as made out to be","Many have rode on past reviews and went on about how ""artistic"" this street is, particularly in terms of the art items and souvenirs on offer. But this turned out to be little more than a touristy souvenir spot, with most items more expensive than what you can find elsewhere, like the Dongdaemun and Namdaemun night markets. We were hoping that the Ssamziegil mall could provide some retail therapy, but again there was nothing really appeared impressive or ""uniquely"" Korean that we could buy. So despite bringing a lot of cash we left with only hot snacks (yes, delicious hotteoks) in our hands."
"Nothing much, but still okay","Its a lot different than Myeongdong. The place is rather upmarket, so our guide warn us that this is a no-bargain street. Good to hangout for the cafes and place to eat around there. Beware of stuck up Ahjumma whom is cold and dislike you for touching stuff inside her shop. But other seems okay. I didnt buy anything here as its a little expensive. we just eat round here -- the best grilled fish we had.its touristy, had a lot of seller spoke in my mother tongue. at least the basics..lol"
Cheaper than others,If u are looking for souveniers this is the place. Their souveniers are slightly cheaper compared to other area.
Great place for shopping!,Nice place to shop for souvenirs....it was cold as hell in December so we couldn't enjoy walking outside very much but it was a great place to visit.
Class shopping,"A shopping and entertaining place- small to big shops,souvenir bargain hunters can also try their luck, a couple of good art galleries,a live show, plenty of variety of foods, Indian Restaurant ""Little India on 2nd Floor in middle of the street walk."
Street for tourists,"Insadong is a street that one shouldn't miss - take in the many restaurants, souvenir shops and street vendors. In the end, however, it's just that, a collection of shops aimed at tourists. If you're looking for architectural highlights or historical sights, look elsewhere."
nothing much,i bought chopsticks and a teapot set. basically you got to appreciate whats there in the first place. fashion apparels might not be the place to be for you here
Must visit in Seoul,"Insa-dong is a gem in Seoul. While it may be a little touristy, the place still retains its old world charm especially the Bukchon Hanok Village where residents of the ancient traditional houses have to jostle with tourists descending into their world till sundown. There is some commercialization as a number of these old houses have been bought and converted into shops or cafes (much like the UNESCO Heritage Lijiang Old Town in China). But stepping into one of these cafes for coffee allowed us to experience a hanok and explore its interior.If you are into shopping, the shops in Insa-dong provide a respite from the usual merchandise you find in malls and Myeong Dong. The area is more cultural so the shops sell traditional Korean stuff such as pottery, rice paper greeting cards/notebooks and other Korean arts and crafts. Even the modern mall there sells things that appeal to the younger generation but these are infused with a Korean identity. We thought that made the mechandise more unique and interesting.Another aspect of Insa-Dong that we liked were the pojangmachas (street food vendors) (although pojangmachas are not unique only to Insa Dong.). We had dinner at the pojangmachas located along Insa-Dong 5-gil opposite the CenterMark Hotel. It is easy to spot them as they are sited in heated orange tents and patrons sit around makeshift tables and stools. (You see these in Korean dramas where the characters go to drown their sorrows in soju. Lol !!) The food at both pojangmachas downed with soju and beer was excellent - easily the best we had in Seoul in our 6-day stay. And the experience of dining in a pojangmacha was great! But don't expect it to be cheap just because it is a road site stall.Do make time for a visit to Insa-Dong. It ranks among the top places for us in Seoul."
Insadong - a fun place to ramble around," Insadong is full of art galleries, tea houses, antique shops, and restaurants. Plus a unique shopping complex called Ssamzie-gil where you can also take different art classes in the basement level. A fun area to walk around and enjoy the sites. There 4/13."
Insadong.,"Very entertaining street, lots of shops and places to eat. Crowds of people on the weekend and on Sundays there is no car traffic."
Nice Village,The whole place is an old village... Architecture is really good... People are friendly. We just roamed about the place esp. the Bukchon Village. A lot of walking but we didnt feel tired at all
Nice place to stroll.,"The Insadong street is a veru nice place to visit although many items are ""tourist prices"" meaning its higher than usual... it is still a must to see this street."
My fav market in Seoul!,"I really enjoyed the market street. Heaps of arts and crafts. We ended up buying a beautiful hand painted art scroll from a little store in Insadong. Come here for souvenirs however be a bit careful when it comes to eating out. It is quite expensive in the larger restaurants. That being said, there was a fantastic dumpling restaurant tucked away on a side street which was amazing! :)There is a very helpful tourist information centre located at the start of the street. They give you a map to the Hanok village and the palaces."
Fascinating,"We ended up in Insadong so many times during our wonderful stay in Seoul as it is the geographic (and indeed cultural) intersection of so much of the city. Wonderful tea in a tea salon, lots of looking and shopping possibilities which kept us occupied and a long-awaited opportunity to try out the doctor fish pedicure that was ticklish and fun."
shopping street,Insadong is a must to go if you are tourist since you can find a lot of souvenir shops along the street. A tourist information center is also located at the area to provide you a specific map of the whole area with shop and street names which i find very helpful to tourists..
"Quaint, artsy place","Walking distance from the Buchon Hanok Village. Lots of small, interesting and artsy shops and narrow alleys. Take time to explore the place. Come here for souvenirs and street food. Must try would be the dragon beard candy, double cone ice-cream, dumplings and bean curd. If you are lucky, you can catch some traditional performances at the stage area near the entrance of the street. "
Nice shopping experience,"Generally a tourist-friendly place. But that also means things are a little pricey. I came across many interesting sights, but personally, I didn't have much to buy there. "
Traditional Shopping Haven,"Love this place so much! I was almost unable to control myself not to buy those pretty bookmarks, traditional pottery, pearl jewelry box, and so on and so on. Besides individual shops, there are some commercial buildings that house the shops inside. The food there is also amazing though a bit expensive compared to other area in Seoul, but hey, you're in Insadong. I found a shop that sells antiques at one of the alleys there. A must visit when you are in Seoul."
Lovely!,Insadong is such a lovely place in Seoul with all the small shops. Some corners feel like time has just stopped! A must visit when in Seoul! 
Second time around,This place is fun for tourists and even locals living here. All the businesses are spelled out in Korean which ia fun. Good place to pick up gifts for people back home or decorations for your home. I found many calligraphy drawings from local artist and paintings directly from the artists all over the place at reasonable prices...fun to walk around with a corn shaped coned filled ice cream. You'll know what ice cream it is because all the kids are busy eating them along the street. 
Loved this areas,"This cool area is packed with souvenir shops, gorgeous galleries and interesting eating areas with a busy vibe. Make sure you buy your souvenirs here as you may not see them anywhere else. Highly recommend visiting this very cool area of Seoul. "
"If its traditional Korean art, crafts and gifts you want this is the place.","A popular tourist shopping and dining area of Seoul. I did not spend that long here as I am more of an explorer than a shopper, but there are some interesting sights here such as traditional writing brushes, masks and clothing and some interesting craft and art shops. Also lots of cafes and traditional things to snack on. Explore the side streets as well as the main road and do pay the very beautiful Jogye-sa Temple a visit whilst in the area (See my separate temple review)."
Great!,"I enjoyed going to Insadong! It is very unique and special. There is a lot of shopping, culture, and people!! There are many roads as well."
Unique finds,"It was a nice walk up and down the street looking at the nice arts and craft things. It is a tourist place for sure, but there are nice gifts and wonderful cafés. It is easy to get to by the metro, so no worries there. There are lots of traditional Korean clothing and crafts on offer, but be sure to haggle if you can!"
Touristic spot,Crowded. Full of souvenirs. Shops. Nearby everything. My good rating is because I found a dumplings shop in one of the alleys and they were extreme!!!
Fantastic Place for Souvenirs,"This is the perfect street to grab all the souvenirs you need before leaving the city. It has rows after rows of authentic shops selling korean utensils, magnets and traditional paper; you name it, they have it. There are a couple of temples nearby, so you can visit them before or after your shopping spree. I really enjoy walking around this area as it's really different from the usual hustle and bustle in Seoul. Do visit the Bukcheon Village if you're intending to stop by Insadong; it's only about 15 minutes walk away!"
lively place,all sorts of people here. Be careful of the minimart and the G25 shops. they will charge foreigners more if yiu are unfamiliar with the discounts. 
Good place to buy souvenirs,"We began our shopping at Ssamziegil Mall. There were a variety of stores here, from souvenirs to bags and clothes. We bought some unique souvenirs (made from wood) with cute bells attached, from a store on the groundfloor.However, along Insadong street could be seen countless souvenir shops. Haggling could be done here, though some shopkeepers were a bit unfriendly and rude. We bought several sets of the typical Korean chopsticks (flat ones) and long spoons. A whole set of ten in a lovely box of red was KRW22,000. A separate box for a set of 5 in a white box was KRW10,000. Keychains and fridge magnets were everywhere. For KRW10,000, you could get a whole batch of ten.Some good eateries could be found here too. Prices were lower and the food tasted as delicious as at other places.We also spotted a big shop selling amethyst, citrine stones, etc. Prices were reasonable. It's indeed wonderful to shop at Insadong, especially if you want to buy souvenirs. Oh yes, there're also 2 or 3 shops selling bags all at the fixed price of KRW10,000."
Traditional stuffs that you can find here as souvenirs,"Insadong is a street lined with traditional stuffs, could be more for tourists who want something more traditional and not the usual cosmetics and clothings sales that you can find elsewhere."
Walking alone ,"Although is just another street like Myeongdong but this has more things to see instead of cosmetics, clothing etc. Some shops along the side alleys are rather unique with long queue of customers. Easily accessible as it's near to subway station"
Authentic souvenir shops!,"Love this place... Its very long alley with souvenir shops... Not just selling cheap souvenirs but also authentic things, such as caligraphs, potteries, and even hanbok... Really enjoy visiting this place while shopping souvenirs for people back home... It has also a tourist center if u need anything... Really recommended!"
Good Place for Souvenirs,"Seoul is a shopping mecca but I find it a difficult place to purchase souvenirs that represent Korea. A trip to Insadong is a pleasant way to check souvenirs off your list and get on with shopping for yourself!If you are accessing Insadong via subway, the closest stop is Anguk on the #3 line (or Jongno 3-ga on the #1 line). You can also add this to a visit to Gyeongbokeung, but don't try to pull that off with young kids.You can purchase art, carved name stamps in Korean, Roman letters, or Chinese characters, art and other unique items on this street. I recommend having a meal here as well. The food is reasonably priced, tasty and pretty authentic. There are also many cafes, either modern or appearing to be very rustic. The overall Insadong experience is rather pleasant even though it's a tourist destination.I recommend getting here when the stores open (10:30am), shop and have lunch. Things get a lot busier in the afternoon. One last thing - if you need to go to the bathroom there are bathrooms on each floor of the Ssamziegil complex, located on the east side of the main Insadong street."
Nice,I like strolling through the streets enjoying all the street food and arts. Nice place to buy souvenirs. Absolutely love the traditional atmosphere.
Cultural Cosy Street,"Wonderful souvenir shopping, nice eateries around. Nice walk around the area to see and find several interesting stalls selling vintage looking stuffs. Not to mention old collectable vintage watches. Found the korean ice cream place. Wonderful and delicious. Was also at a restuarant that serves perfect dumplings !"
One of a kind,"Loved this place for all the good reasons. The streets and alleys of Insadong are filled with small shops selling Korean souvenirs and chic cafes making it a perfect place to hang out. However, the shops here close by 9pm so make sure you go there earlier. As it was freezing cold when we were there, we bought a cup of ginger & citrus drink which was very soothing to the body and I definitely recommend that. Oh, dont forget to try the skewered giant squid while you are there! I also got good deals of my cosmetics while i was here so dont forget to be alert, especially to the ladies. And dont forget to mention you are a foreigner and ask for more free gifts to take back home, they will gladly give you. Love how generous the Koreans are. Will definitely come back to Insadong."
Local art and food,This is a place for local art and food. The atmosphere is good and I reallu like Seoul these days as they have tourist staff everywhere to help you fing what you want. They have little shops that selling local art design and feel free to browse around. The restaurant there are unique and less crowded as in Myeong Dong.
One long tourist street,"Good for shopping, we also found nice Korean food as well as Starbucks cheek by jowl! We also found lots and lots of souvenirs here, so if you want that bunch of korean chopsticks to take home this is the place to get them. There was one very large souvenir shop at the end of the strand so if you are a one stop shopper it is probably the best place to go!"
Nice base from which to see Seoul,"Stayed in Insadong. Enjoyed the performances, street food and general buzz here, particularly on weekends. Did more window shopping than actual shopping."
cool tourist markets and restaurants,"I liked the vibe here, lots of shops selling tourist souvenirs and nice restaurants in the alleyways (go for the ones that are fairly crowded)."
A great street market area.,"This is probably the best (and most famous) part of Seoul for tourists to come to relax and enjoy a stroll (or some shopping).The area is filled with small restaurants, cafés, picturesque allies and lovely little shops.The main street in the quarter is almost constantly crowded with people, stalls, street performers and demonstrators for numerous causes.Make sure to visit the area both during the day and after dark, as it looks totally different in the evening and has a very young and hip vibe to it."
Great area to chill,I like Insadong because it's got a relaxed vibe. Came here twice on my trip to Seoul and spent one day visiting the traditional tea houses here (there are a lot!). Go to the visitor centre in Insadong (they also have traditional hanboks for you to try) and ask them where the tea houses are; better if you do your own research so you can ask them specifically where the place is.You can do Gyeongbokgung - Changdeokgung - Bukchon Hanok Village - Insadong -Cheonggyejeon Stream in one day.
Good for handmade handicraft / artistic products,"We went there on a Sat. afternoon and the place was very lively (and crowded). It is a a very nice area to stroll around and to admire the handicraft products sold here. However, they are not cheap. The buildings here are more traditional, so you get a more authentic feel of Seoul, compared to the metropolitan shopping districts like Myeongdong (which I loved too, for different reasons). We love what this area has to offer - unique souvenir products, interesting street food, good restaurants. It was freezing cold when we were there (it snowed) and we are too glad to have stumbled upon O'sulloc Tea House, which served sample green tea to guests. We bought some of their products as we love drinking green tea and was very impressed by the smoothness of their tea."
Just Souvenir,"You may find a lot of souvenirs here.. please do ask ""ka ka ju se yo"" (means discount please) before you purchase :)"
Souvenirs,"Souvenirs are usually not cheap everywhere in the world. but you can get handmade, personalized items from Insadong. Love this place to the max !"
Great area,"Insadong is great area surrounded by lots of attractions , shops and restaurants in walking distance .. Many subway stations and local handmade stuff and also local food ."
Walking street of art store,"Another place in Seoul that can relax walk. Shops on street sell Korean culture products such as tea, painting, collectible and sweet candy. Happy to be here in weekday but may crowed in holiday. End of street connect to Nakwon building where biggest music instrument shops in Seoul."
addicted to Insadong,"what can I say... everything that you imagine in Seoul for eating, shopping and hanging out is just right here in Insadong.. 5 hours is not enough.. maybe 2 days..."
Cultural and food,I stay neared the Insadong during the visit in Korea. A nice place where you can find many type of souvenir and a lot of restaurant over there. I pretty like this place.
Cultural trail in the city,"I was lucky to get a glimpse of excitement in Insadong, they have many cafes and eateries as well as interesting art and craft, love the little cafe library on the second story of Insadong, try their local snacks. Restaurants are pricey and not really delicious."
Shopping,Amazing shops a stones through away from hotel. Safe and reasonably prized stores and markets. A great variety of food i. Various restaurants
Worth the trip,We took the subway based on TA's suggested self tours and found the street in no time. Its touristy but at least everything is in one place and its not too crowded. There are a lot of shops selling the same cheap stuff but there are a few gems in there. Try the multi-story mall for some interesting local artist products. Plenty of tea houses and restaurants. 
a bit overrated,"nice place for tourists during the day, for drinking at night...but does not live up to it's reputation ..."
"If you've only got a little time in Seoul, don't miss Insadong","Insadong is a one-stop experience if you want a little of everything from Seoul and Korean culture. Traditional linens, brushes, inks, teas, ceramics and embroidery are easy to find here, and for lunch or dinner you can find an affordable meal of traditional veggie and seafood pancakes and makgoli, or bibimbap, or Korean BBQ and beer. Just wander into one of the many eateries and a helpful server will get you set up. The main street is beautiful, with winding alleyways in which to lose yourself only to end up at a traditional hanok guesthouse or teahouse. The plethora of streetfood is seasonal and delicious. Stop in at the little Buddhist temple, or listen to a street performer playing music at the public stage or on any street corner. That this is a favorite hang-out for Seoul residents as well as tourists speaks to its wide appeal."
Worth a stroll...,"I liked the variety of shops on this street but I didn't see any antique stores as expected. Perhaps down the side streets? There are many tourist shops here, but it's fun to look and the comedy antics of the ""king's biscuits"" sellers are quite hilarious. They will do a whole routine in an effort to get you to buy some, which we did. Quite delicious! Eat them all the day you buy them or refrigerate. (I live in Seoul and have not seen these elsewhere.) We bought amethyst jewelry at one of the shops...you can ""bargain"" at most stalls and shops, I believe. Worth a stroll and a look unless it is just too hot and humid for you."
So much to see,"This is a good place to shop for everyone. Families, art and antique shoppers & those looking for kitschy little souvenirs to take back to friends & relatives. There are also many restaurants (go down the stairwells to below street level for many of the best). Also, look for the vendors selling ice cream made with liquid nitrogen. It's a show as well as a treat!"
A very happening place,"We walked through Insadong on a Saturday and the street is packed with people shopping and people performing. It is a great place to shop for souvenirs, hand crafted products & there are also a lot of eateries. "
Great street for Shopping,"If you want to go shopping and have a great time, do not miss the Insadong area of Seoul. Wonderful clothing designers, first class art galleries, Korean merchandise of first quality and great restaruants. We wandered about there for over 3 hours and did not see it all"
Awesome crafty store,This place has han amazing bibimbap restaurant called Gogung. Also has cool antique and crafty shops. 
worth seeing just for the experience,"quanit shops selling souvenir. doesn't have pushy store clerks like Myeundong. nice, friendly store owners."
Tourist trap but has hidden gems!,- Too crowded! - Too Expensive!- Most souvenir shops carry the same items and sell them for different prices look around first!- Not very traditional anymore. - Very much get in get out attitude from most store owners!- Cheapish atmosphere!+ Haggle is possible!++++ Some restaurants on the back streets are really good among the best in Seoul!+ Some really good food stands on the streets but you have to try your luck!
The other way to explore Korea,"Feel relaxing when slow walk in here. Here is a place with traditional Korea culture but you also can see the creativity. The shops selling something special like hand made decoration, ladies accessories etc. Sometimes has performance if you are lucky. "
Neat combination of Urban and traditional flair.,"I was able to spend about 1 hour touristing around Insadong. So many art galleries. Lots of friendly faces and a combination of both nice and kitchie items for shopping.My visit was part of a longer tour of the city. In retrospect, I wish I'd just gotten a cab there and avoided the rush of getting back on the tour bus."
Worth a visit!,"Seoul has a ton of shopping, but Insadong offers more original crafts and shopping than the regular markets and malls. I've been back three times, and always find something I love. Mind you, some of the stalls are a bit pricey depending on what they sell, but I've always been happy with the purchase. My personal favourite are the hand-made paper lamps: beautiful, and they make great gifts! I prefer Insadong to the chaos of the mega-complex of Myendong, where there may be more mainstream shopping, but with things you could get anywhere. Insadong is definitely worth a visit!"
Busy but great place,"Very nice and charming place to spend an afternoon, shopping or window shopping. Buy soveniors or street art at reasonable a price. Lots of eateries around."
Worth a visit,"Insadong has changed alot over the last few years. The chain stores and big coffee shops have moved in, but its still a nice place to visit. There are a lot of antique stores and craft shops. I recommend going during a weekday as weekends are extremely busy."
Good food and so-so souvenirs,"Insadong is billed as a must visit place for tourists looking for souvenirs and typical Korean art and craft objects. It is that and there are dozens of stalls selling, well pretty much the same things that you find in souvenir stores elsewhere in the world except with Korean themes. So if you are looking for a fridge magnet, or bookmarks or dolls in Korean costume, you will find it here.There are also quite a few art galleries, some with interesting pictures with both classical and contemporary subjects.Some shops featured antiques and there was at least one roadside stall that had some a quite interesting collection of brass objects, including bells, statutes and phallic objects.Possibly the more interesting thing about this area are the many restaurants featuring traditional Korean cuisine, Korean fusion restaurants featuring a modern twist to traditional Korean dishes and some offering western food. We tried a couple and enjoyed both of them.Signs in this part of Seoul are all in Korean, apparently in line with a government ruling for this precinct, and it was interesting to see Starbucks writ in Hangul and only recognisable by the logo and signage style.At night, stalls also offer typical Korean street food and some western additions like crepes."
Souvenirs and Specialty Items,"Whenever I travel, I love going to places to buy souvenirs, not necessarily the local crafts or popular touristy souvenirs, but something unique that I can find in a place. It could be lavender from Hokkaido or a hand crafted tuk tuk made from coke zero can materials from Cambodia.Insadong fits that description for me. Here are a lot of quaint little specialty stores where you can find many different products, crafts, and unique or special items. I got a do it yourself charm bracelet and a miniature bottle of Korean Sake and Beer from here, and it will always remind me of my trip here.It's also a pedestrian shopping lane much like Myeongdong but you can find more specialty items here. There are also a lot of food stalls where you can get to try the local street food."
Nice stroll,"This is s place where you can visit after Bukchon. From Bukchon walk back to Anguk station and exit 6, walk about 40m on the left is the Insadong walking street. You can visit the Ssamziegil where all the artistic stuffs are available. There are also many roadside eateries where you can try the local food."
Great Shopping!!,"There are some nice galleries and shopping here. We did notice that a lot of the shops had the same thing for sale but there are a few with unique items. The prices are pretty reasonable for most things. You could easily spend hours here browsing and snooping. In some stores, you can bargain the price down. There are restaurants here as well."
Authentic Seoul,"Well, I am not sure if it is authentic or not, but it is a neighborhood worth visiting. Go cruise through the small streets and alleys and get a real feel for Seoul. Good place to buy souvenirs. A short walk from the Gyeonbokgung palace."
Great for Gifts and Amazing Tea Houses,"With only 1 hour to spare I was initially reluctant to head to Invading. And while I didn't traverse the whole street this time, I was able to find some stunning gifts for friends and family and enjoyed a wonderful cup (more like a soup bowl) of Citron and Honey Coffee. While there's a range of mainstream gifts the hand made paper stores are fantastic as are the art shops. sure it's touristy but take your time and soak up the atmosphere. Even the Ukranian confectionery seller as entertainment. A beautiful temple is also just of the main thoroughfare. Finally while bargaining is acceptable the discounts are small so don't expect great reductions."
"Cultural street, traditional eats.","Not far from eujiro1 station or myeongdong area.Insadong street is a vibrant, loud, colorful, crowded and festive place. lots to see and full of great street food. Great day out for tourists, dates and family outings. The street vendors are friendly very helpful to explain culture etc.Great place to buy souvenir for friends and family.would recommend a visit if in the area."
Insadong - place of tradition Korean culture and arts,"Spent a quiet midweek afternoon strolling from Seoul Station to Insadong. To have a really scenic walk follow the trail along the remade Urban Stream or Cheonggyechon . You will walk past some open air Art Gallery, Wooden benches at the side walk for you to stop and admire the gardens by the stream, paintings on the walls illustrating the history of Old Korea. Before you know it, you arrive at the edge of Insadong, next to the temple. You will see little kiosks selling artistic gifts like bronze bells, ceramic cups and tea pots, calligraphy pieces... There are also really famous artists who open their pottery workshop there.Take your time to browse. Then have a nice cup of green tea at the award winning Olsutuc ( if I am right ?) green tea cafe , and try their equally fabulous green tea tiramisu. There.. Your afternoon is complete ! "
"Unattractive to people from HK, Taiwan or China","Thanks to many people who strongly recommended this area to me, I went there twice, in this May and August. Yet I was not impressed. It is a very touristic area, full of shops selling souvenirs or so called cultural gifts like old books, Chinese ink and leather pens that are quite common in HK, Taiwan or China. The circular building inside Insadong is nothing special. Shops are very similar to those at Causeway Bay Plaza 1 or 2 in HK, selling decorative gifts that are made by mass production....."
A shopping street,"Visited the street on October, during noon. It was very crowded. Maybe even more crowded than usual, since it was a Sunday and weekend dedicated for Chinese culture.Since we're not interested in shopping that much, nor in art or antiques, we found this pedestrian street nice, but didn't see anything special about it.We tried one of the restaurants there but the food was mediocre."
"Tourists, Traditional","Good place or maybe a Must place to visit for tourists. Clean streets and easy to get your way round. Street stores for souvenirs and also traditional korean houses around the area. You can go by walking , takes 15-20min walk all the way north from eujiro1 station or myeongdong area. "
Cute place and nice atmosphere,"We went here on our second time to Seoul. Since we already went to the other attractions last time, we had an afternoon to spare here.The place is full of quaint little shops selling traditional wares and funky trinkets. We were able to buy stainless steel bowls at a reasonable price. The cute trinkets though can be a bit pricey but then again, you're paying for the novelty and creativity.Not exactly the best shopping destination in Seoul but it is great for a nice stroll."
Souvenir shopping street,"This is the place if you looking to buy souvenir.Lot of souvenir shops located along the street.From a simple key chain, magnet, pen to painting or korean traditional costume, you can easily find all in InsadongA must visit place for those looking for a souvenir"
"Street Food, Music and Shopping.","If you have the chance to spend the afternoon on Insadong street- do it! It's a loud, crowded and festive scene. There's street performers and tons of street food options. It feels really safe too. Maybe I should have been, but I wasn't worried about pick pockets..it wasn't that kind of crowd. Lots of families and teenagers on dates. The shopping is mostly touristy crap- but it's cheap and fun. There are several good skin care/makeup shops there. They give you lots of freebies with your purchase- so make sure to ask. The street vendors expect you to haggle with them a little. "
Nice Place to Vist for all Tourists,"Live performances by various street artist (especially Painters , Singer ) will mesmerise you.Buying souvenirs is great in Insadong as there many shops selling all manner of Korean souvenirs; from cheap (keychains,chopsticks, Korean Spoons ) to expensive (teapots and paintings). its a must to Visit if you want few souvenirs while your way to Home country."
A must see ,"If you want to see a great market in Seoul Insadong is the place to go!! So much happening, great shopping and street food of all kinds. "
Perfect Combination of Food and Shopping,Old school food and shopping in a very comfortable and tourist friendly setting. Must enjoy the funky coned ice cream. Every kind of cuisine available.
Bargain Shopper's Haven,"It is the place to shop for souvenir items, arts & crafts, herbal products,etc. You name it, they have it at super bargain prices as compared elsewhere.There are also a lot of good restaurants when you're done shopping. It's also interesting to go through the whole street lined with shops & see everything & be amazed. Since it's a tourist area, be prepared to be in a crowd of people."
A peek into old Korea in Seoul,A good place for old village shots in the centre. Souvenir shopping is also good in this place. A bit crowded sometimes but it won't bother you. It's a short walk from the train station.
Love this place for tea pairing with traditional honeyed malt dessert...,"ice ice babe, we..love the boxed candy which can be frozen and eaten fresh for a month or longer..it is a show stopper in its own..Just walk up and up and enjoyed window shopping with tons of trinkets to include young love written to be displayed.."
A great artistic shopping area,"There are a lot of interesting shops selling all kind of Korean arts and ceramic pots and cups, beautiful pictures, souvenirs. There is a lot of good restaurants around as well, there is one which sell tea and tea cakes which is very good. "
Don't miss Insadong!,"A great place to see arts and crafts! I think you need a whole day here! I especially liked the Ssamji-gil Shopping place. Don't miss it- It was very interesting. I especially liked the handmade journals, metal sculpture, indie jewelry, printed paper products and unusual crafts. There was one store just filled with all sorts of brushes of different kinds. Lots of galleries. A don't miss place!"
Traditional Culture Overview on One Street,"There are a few laneways worth exploring, especially for the temple food and tea houses, but most of the action is on the main street. Weekends, while busier, are more fun with street vendors, performers and ""event"" pop-up sales. Best place to buy gorgeous hanji paper and any art supplies. Many stores sell seasonally, so in autumn you'll find scarves on sale and sun hats in spring. Lots of touristy souvenirs if you're interested and foreigners are common so there's a bit more English and a bit less staring. "
Insadong,"This is the best place to eat - whether high end bebimbob or Flea market shopping, food stalls, souvenir shops, beautiful girls attired in traditional dress doing classic dances at the culture center. It's very crowded but well worth the visit. We visited it twice because we liked it so much. Never a dull moment!"
Vibrant Place for both young and old,Love this place with its artsy-fartsy atmosphere in the air. Manage to catch a street performance at Ssamziegil and lots of cute trinkets here. I believe the young ones will definitely enjoy this place. Lots of food outside and street delicacies. Won't mind coming back here again one of these days.
Traditional village,A lot a small shops selling everything from hello kitty to hand made dolls Good local field if you like spicy food Nice for a walk through but more Nick nack shopping then traditional 
Lots of things to look at,"We stayed very near to Insadong during our trip, and there are just too many things to look at here. We planned to spend only a few hours here but ended up staying till evening! There are lots of resturants here thankfully and we took a rest and replenished our stomachs before moving on for more shopping. The highlight in Insadong is the Ssamji-gil shopping mall-look out for my review on it please for more information"
Lovely walking area,Quite a delight to visit if you like to walk the streets of Seoul and do some window shopping and chill out in any of the coffeeshops all over the area. Definitely a must go as it is just next to the Anguk Station - I also posted up a photo of the tourist map that shows the area. Happy shopping! 
Fun time,"My friends and I had a great time in Insadong. Food and shopping. Food and shopping, Need I say more? Oh, and it's pretty inexpensive too!"
A crowed experience.,"A great shopping area - lots of cafés. Especially the dog café was great! A store with socks for 1.000 won each. Very cheap and very, very crowed. In the evening are there a lot of extra small ""shops"" in the streets with different kinds of street food. Squid, chicken, sweets and much more. A great place to spend (too much) money and, all in all, an amazing experience!"
"Cultural arts, gallery and shopping","Insadong is open air shopping where you can find souvenirs, galleries and traditional arts and crafts. Atmosphere is very different to Myeongdong. Highly recommended!"
Open space Tourist hunts,"Insadong is a open aired tourist hunt roadside stalls. Selling all sorts o modern to antique Korean souvenirs. A tourist information booth s at its entrance. U ll b greeted by a bronzed gigantic brush at t traffic junction. Shops r selling all sorts o backpacks to luggages.Arirang restaurant offers t spicy raw crabs to pan fried veg pancake. T spicy crabs was a side dish but now u hv to pay 3,000won for this fantastic spicy appetizer that whets yr appetite to its greatest height! Drown it down w makeoli o soju, u certainly hv attained t complete Korean cuisine. A leisurely tourist lane u would like to wonder."
Modern cultural shopping street,"Nice strolling street if you like artistic and cultural things. Pricing not cheap esp if you are looking at cultural items. If you are looking for more localized shopping area, Namdemum is a better place."
Missing in authenticity,"Insadong is very well located, but caters mostly for tourists, and offers a wide variety of cheap yet overpriced Korea-themed souvenirs. Especially, its main street will be the rally point of scores of foreigners. Of course, it's the perfect place to bring back gifts to friends, but for someone who wants to know what Korea is really about, this isn't the ideal location. However, I strongly encourage you to take the back alleys of Insadong to discover truly traditional Korean restaurants and shops that will be more anthentic and of better quality."
Different shopping experience,The shops in Insadong is a little bit different with more arts and culture aspects. Most of the shops display handmade handicrafts or their own brand. I thought it was a tourist street but vehicles could still access the street. There's a shop that sell tea leaves and one of their green tea won top the prize in an international competition. 
Love this wonderful place!,"The arts and culture hub of Seoul. There are numerous art galleries, traditional arts and crafts shops, tea houses, restaurants, street performers and cosmetic shops. Definitely a must visit place. "
Try their teas!,So many interesting traditional teas. I like jujube tea and omija tea the best (about 8000 won each). Their green tea lattes are not bad too. Osulloc sells these traditional teas and more. Osculloc sells good quality green tea powder in a screw bottle (airtight) for about 30000won 60g. Really good!
Main touristic street of Seoul,"This is the main touristic street of Seoul and it has lots of souvenir shops, art stores and traditional eateries. Also just close to the Jogyesa temple in the street which runs parallel to Insadong, there is a small place in which you can rent and wear a hanbok for 20 minutes for 3000 KRW. This would be an unforgettable experience for foreigners. You can take lots of photos in 20 minutes. One more thing, don't forget to buy ice cream from the Turkish ice cream shop at the Insadong intersection. The ice-cream guy has lots of funny tricks for you and it is really hard to take the ice cream from his hands. Just try and see and burst into laughter."
Good place to stroll and purchase your Korean souvenirs,"Insadong is the place to buy all your traditional Korean souvenirs and to take home some Korean cakes and treats. I didn’t really buy much, but it was nice to walk around and check out some traditional gifts you can buy and after exploring the Bukchon Hanok Village and Gyeongbokgung Palace area."
A small interesting town,"Although a lot of tourists there, it's still authentic Korean in food and style. Should try the Korean dessert cafe at the end of street, those desserts are so yummy and special. The smally food shop along the street is interesting, if you want to discover local food, should try them."
Cultural Shopping at its finest!,"Just a few blocks from GyeongukGoong Palace, this place is a goldmine if you want to shop for cultural items and cute souvenirs. We were able to purchase a great tea set and a few hand painted pieces of art at a local shop - where you can also try to haggle your way into a lower price. The food and cafe's here are delicious as well - try stopping by any number of cafes for some bingsu action to rest your tired feet. Insadong is also connected to an pop culture shopping mall called zzamzagil where you can land a lot of handmade items for a great price. For the Korean TV fan, they also filled ""The Return of Superman"" which is a popular reality TV show in Korea - one of the episodes, you'll see the Choo Sarang family shopping for handmade stamps and lamps."
Must visit!,"I wasn't really interested in coming here when I first heard it, but my Korean friend recommend me this place to buy traditional Korean souvenirs such as key chain, pencil case etc. There are a lot of shops to choose from, and if you go to center part you'll find a shopping mall with lots of cute shops and photo booth. I also ate weird looking ice cream! almost everything in Insadong is fun to explore!"
"Great street, great district","Insadong-gil and the surrounding labyrinth of alleyways surrounding it is a must. Coffee shops, galleries, boutiques gallor. Go on the weekend when they close the street to cars and it becomes s pedestrian haven. Enjoy a coffee and sweet from a second or third floor coffee shop and soak in the ever changing atmosphere below. "
Good place to walk around,"If you're interested in cultural stuff, this is a good place to walk around. If you're into shopping, most of the shops here sells basically similar things and similar prices. If you're interested to explore the alleys, then this area is a great place to explore. There are many side alleys with hidden gems waiting for you to discover."
Cultural environment filled with excitement,"Insadong is a very interesting location to visit in Korea. It is full of shops of Korea culture, a nice place to shop for souvenir and have a relaxing meal in local restaurant. It is suitable for most visitors except family very young ones of less than 5 years old."
Fun with the right expectations!,"Insadong used to be older and a bit more exciting but they modernized it a little bit, so you don't feel the old Korean atmosphere that you used to feel (try going to the Korean Folk Village in Yongin for that). However, you can experience some nice things if you take your time. For example, 1. There are a few art museums that are nice to stroll through2. Some really nice traditional tea rooms which have the traditional atmosphere3. Some restaurants with Korean traditional food. 4. Places to get souvenirs- Stick with the keychains, fans, and calligraphy pictures. The others are definitely overpriced. 5. Korean street foodAfter you've done that, you can visit Chengyecheon (Cheongye Stream) in the Jongno area."
for tourist,"A place for tourists, prices are higher compared to markets in Seoul that sells souvenirs, I would recommend more Namdemun market"
excellent teahouses and restaurants,really busy on weekends with tourist everywhere. the traditional teahouse i visited and the fusion restaurant was excellent.
The tourist centre of Seoul,This is the old centre of Seoul. The main street Insadong-gil is lined with shops and restaurants. Look for the people in red shirts and red cowboy hats they have information and detailed maps of Insadong
The place to come to for Korea souvenirs,"Any tourist to Korea should stop by Insadong. If you are not already staying at the brilliant and affordable Hotel Sunbee around the corner, this place is a must see. It's not necessarily exciting, but for all those stretched for time and in need of souvenir fixes this is like Mecca. Find all the typical souvenirs that delight a tourists heart without the overly trashy and sleaze associated with Tourist shopping hot spots you will find in places like Barcelona or even London. Prices are reasonable, most shop-owners are open to bartering and there are some truly beautiful pieces of art on display (recommended are the mask shops towards Gyeongbokung end of the street).Abundant with tea houses, close to Bukcheon and all of the 5 palaces of Seoul and some nifty little restaurants and coffee houses its a Seoul microcosm all in its own right."
cute local made market place,everyone enjoyed this street. easy to walk through and you are able to see only local made products. this is where you will be able to find many affordable gifts to take back. easy to explore and find unique korean products.
Shoppers paradise?,"I don't do shopping so I was hoping for some photo opps. Regrettably there were very few. Alleys were over modernised and overloaded with advertising. Food, drinks were all tourist level. A no-go for me.."
A very wide variety of choices,"If you are a tourist and you are looking for Korean souvenirs to give to your friends, this is the place to go. There are very many items to buy-- from traditional to contemporary Korean designs, ranging from expensive to affordable prices. There are items sold in the middle of the street and also those in shops and boutiques. There are also Korean restaurants tucked in the side streets. We were able to discover one, Nut the Pub Restaurant (tel no. 02-733-9045) which served delicious and reasonably priced bulgogi and potato pancakes. We also watched a group of ladies dance a modern dance. It is very easy to go to via the train."
Great tourist shopping area,"Insadong is great for tourist shopping, you'll find many gift and souvenir shops, and traditional clothing and street food, it's also a nice walk and you will see some cultural exhibitions, once there don't forget to visit one of the palaces near by, and the lovely residential district just a few steps away from Anguk metro station."
Pleasant surprise,"Insadong has many small artsy boutique shops on a pedestrian only street. The shops have a Korean twist combining new designs with traditional Korean style. Take your time, more than an hour. "
A very nice place,"The place is located at the near city. Lots of small shops of boutique and food. Souvenir gifts are everywhere. Streets are clean, is one of the top list for tourist attraction. Some of the craft items are very expensive so try to bargain your way there."
Fun area. Come thirsty for tea.,"Good location to explore the city from. Lots of fun little boutiques, walking distance to palaces and the markets. Lots of great food eats, too. "
Fun tourist attraction,"Definitely a tourist-centered location, but still lots of fun. We were able to purchase a ton of gifts to bring home and most were very reasonably priced. There is a multistory plaza full of locally crafted items ranging from very expensive to reasonably priced unique items. Start at top and walk down. "
Favorite Place in Seoul,"This is one of my most favorite places during my visit in Seoul. Albeit, it does seem very touristy and industry-driven, but Insadong boasts of that Korean that Seoul has to offer. About two kilometer stretch of nothing but shops of handmade and local products, this is the best place to experience what it means to be a tourist in Seoul."
My favorite place in Seoul,"Insadong is definitely a tourist area, but if you can look past the tourists, it's fantastic. I go to Insadong for the art galleries, food and atmosphere, as well as the niknacks to send home to friends and family. Definitely delve into the side streets, don't just stick to the main street, as the side streets have interesting antique stores and some very good eateries. I've been into many of the galleries as well, and they always have a wide range of styles and artists represented/showing, changing artists often enough that there's something new every time I go."
Get local and then it's ok.,"I real don't like places that are crawling with tourists and this is. That said, get local by asking or observing where locals eat. Go deep into alleys. Also go to other parts of town to eat in other food alleys. Everyone seems to eat out all the time there so there are lots of possibilities. "
My Favourite Place in Seoul,"This is easily one of the best areas in Seoul.We found it by chance as we were sitting on the tourist bus, riding around town, looking at difference areas, contemplating whether we would like to return here or there for a more thorough look. Well we did not hesitate to get off the bus at this stop.The place has a very artistic, bohemian, almost hippy feel about it. Just a few steps away from the hustle and bustle of the city it is an oasis of tranquility.The first thing you see is a few people selling their hand made pieces. I immediately bought some earrings from these lovely shy Korean girls.There is more than one street so take your time and wonder around, you will find so many lovely boutiques with a lot of truly unique handmade stuff: clothing, jewelry, hats, bags.. you name it. If you are looking for something different, not the mainstream commercial range, this is the perfect place to come and explore.When you get a bit hungry, go and try local street food, I seriously could not stop myself from having two or three sweet chicken skewers. Lovely staff everywhere, they will chat to you while you eat, help you choose whatever it is you are after. Have a coffee at a local bar, all wooden, very quiet, great coffee.During the day there are always some shows happening in the main street: dancing, singing..I did not want to leave this place. The atmosphere is fantastic, very light and very friendly. It is different. Come and see it for yourself."
Better than duty free!,You can see many street artists and you can buy Korean traditional goods as a gift! 
Asa!,Pretty sure Asa means awesome but not quite too sure lol. Came too to Insadong with some newly made friends from Seoul and Paris and was astonished at the atmosphere here! Lots of things going on everywhere and my brain was getting overloaded! Lots of stores to shop for cultural items as well as new things too! Great place to people watch and to observe the beauty of Seoul!
Slow-pace shopping street,"Many delicious street foods here. Stuffs are cheap but not that well-made. You can find this kind of stuff in Thailand or China in cheaper price. A bit too crowded, so it's not good if you are with kids because they can get lost easily."
Traditional street in the heart of downtown Seoul,"This is very unique street where you can see a variety of traditional Korean items for souvenirs. You can also visit several art galleries for free and experience Korean culture. It is located in the heart of downtown Seoul, so tourist attractions such as Gyeongbokgun Palace, Cheonggaecheon Streama and Seoul City Hall are nearby. It will be a refreshing experience for locals and foreigners!"
Plenty of souvenirs and traditional food,"I spent more time here than expected. There were many souvenirs to choose from. Not all shops have the same souvenirs. Price were reasonable but soon found out that some items like book mark, etc were actually cheaper elsewhere around Seoul.There were many traditional Korean dessert and food to try along the street in Insadong. Highly recommended! "
Insadong shops,"I like going to Insadong because I have a favorite temple food restaurant I like to go to, in addition to, a favorite tea shop where I frequent yearly."
Getting lost in Insadong,"Much like ""getting lost in Venice"" is an experience, ""getting lost in Insadong"" is an experience in and of itself. With so many interesting side streets, there's always an cool crafts shop or a neat traditional tea house just around the corner. Leaving the crowded main street here for the inner streets is a lot of fun. Although it is an area known for buying traditional souvenirs, they did not attract us much. The more appealing options are the jewellery made by local artists in the Ssamziegil complex and along some of the inner streets. Since this is so close to Changdeokgung, it is only natural to come here after the palace visit for a nice stroll and tea. :-)"
Great place for Art and Craft,"After all the serious shopping in Namdaemun and Myeongdong. It was a nice change shopping in Isadong. Enjoyed looking into galleries and craft shops admiring all the the lovely handiworks. The restaurants were less crowded, so we did not feel the rush but enjoyed a slow and relaxed meal.Isadong felt like a real holiday just taking our time people watching and taking a slow stroll visiting handmake crafts shops.When in Seoul, do not give Isadong amiss."
Greatest!!!!!!!!!!!!,All is cool!! Very beautiful street and shops))) And very tasty food))) I love food very much) Korean food is great!!!
The Shopping Mecca,"The shopping mecca of Seoul. You can buy anything in here at a bargain price. All you need to do is ask the sales person... ""Kakanjungsayeo?""... it means, ""Can you please give me a discount?""."
Insadong..wish we could stay long!,"It's a wonderful place for us since we like arts and handcrafted objects. There were many little shops full of crafted goods, souvenirs, lovely clothes and of course, street food! Everything seemed to be calling to us and we wished we could buy them but naturally, we couldn't. Ssamzigiel got us intrigued with its incredible variety of shops offering hand-made goods of all kinds, from ceramic to beads. Then we went to have sol-bing at the Korean Dessert shop...what can I say, after working up a sweat walking around, nothing beats a gigantic made for sharing bowl of sol-bing! Yum!!We really loved Insadong and would definitely go again if we had an opportunity. Lively, arty and oh so pretty ... that's Insadong for us!"
Great place for good price souvenirs,I stayed at Ibis Ambassador Insadong and I could go walking to the Insadong shopping area. The shopping area is amazing. I loved it. So much variety to shop and eat. Amazing. You can't go to South Korea without checking Insadong area. Great Great
Unique shape ice cream corn,"If you visit this neighborhood, don't forget to try unique shape ice cream corn.Also there's a place inside Insa Dong namely Zzamzigil that famous for couple love tag"
Best area for souvenir shopping!,"Insadong was our last stop during our 4-day vacation in Seoul with my sister. It was a strip filled with Korea-made products, perfect for both travellers and tourists.If you are looking for fancy souvenirs, there are a lot of posh shops in the area selling traditional Korean tea sets, masks, jewelries and figurines. For cheaper finds, Insadong also offers a lot of variety such as shirts, caps, Korean pouches and purses, coasters, pens, fridge magnets, fans... Name it! It will help if you make a lot of purchases in one shop to avail of great discounts. Check the little store right beside Insa Art Center (see photos). The lady in glasses was very generous in giving us discounts. I think we saved around 30,000 KRW (about 30 USD) in a single purchase!Insadong is located just a few meters from the subway station and is really a must-visit. Make sure you don't miss going to this souvenir/shopping haven! :)"
Charming neighborhood!,"Insadong is a charming neighborhood, great for walking around, going through the alleys and checking the stores,..plan to have a meal in one of those traditional Korean restaurants! "
Art Market Insadong,"If you like arts and craft, go here. From antiques to contemporary art. Very reasonable prices. Also just a nice stroll."
touristic heart,"this is the touristic heart of seoul. i can compare it to london carnaby street or bangkok khao san road, just to have an idea. full of stals which sell everything and street artists. recommend a visit"
Tourist area with lots of hidden Korean restaurant,"Here is selling typical culture stuff with high price which I'm not too interested in, there are many hidden Korean style restaurants which I don't get a chance to try out. I will come only for food next time."
Hurleysue,"Fun place to shop! Geared for tourists, but is a fun way to spend an afternoon. Be sure to try some of the local street food too."
Very interesting area with lots of stuffs to see and shop,"We took a cab from our hotel, Westin Chosun to Insadong. The fare is less than KRW5000. This place is really interesting. If you are someone who loves handicrafts, you'll like it a lot here. The streets are filled with vendors selling all kinds of handicrafts and street food. Then, there is this building which is probably 4-5 storey high with all the shops being housed in a spiralling order. We were there during their holiday so the place was quite crowded. There are many shops there where you can find nice gifts / souvenirs. We bought a customised musical box for our little girl. We had a nice dinner at one of the many restaurants there and finally, we walked back to our hotel via the cheonggyecheon stream. "
Typical upper class area,"Haute couture, plush restaurants, plastic faces and fancy cars in abundance. The wealth of Insadong is obvious. Pleasant to walk around, but you miss nothing if you skip it, I just had a lot of days in Seoul :) "
Must Visit,"A place where you can find tradition arts and crafts, pottery and even traditional tea houses. Lots of souvenirs shops there to pick up some items for family and friends."
Not Quite What We Were Expecting ,"We had a good time walking around the area and checking out a few of the shops for the first 30mins, but it's not really what we were expecting. It almost felt like we were exiting through a really long gift shop. Most shops have the same stuff with only a few that stand out. I guess I just set the bar too high in my own mind and left a little disappointed. If you have extra time it's worth a quick visit but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. "
Quaint charm with modern touch,"Great place for sightseeing plus shopping - can get a little touristy in the weekends but overall a nice place to walk through the main street. One can also see and get traditional cultural goods eg. bags, clothes. Ssamsigil is a nice place to visit - go round and round the walkway until you reach the rooftop and get your ""angel wings"" - you'll know what I mean when you see it!"
Shopping,My favorite place to shop. Insadong has a ton of antique stores and tea houses. I love to wonder on the street there it gives you a feel of what old Korea must have been like. you always seen the unusual here also.
pleasant 'artsy' place,"It's great to have a bit of break from the usual multi-story shopping centres and go to a more laid-back area with a nice balance of local shops, fashion boutiques, and cafes. Two things that I think really stood out with Insadong are its charming little houses/ buildings, which creates a totally different atmosphere than Myeongdong and Dongdaemun, and also the amount of shops and kiosks selling local-made goods: nicely-packaged snacks, handmade bags, knick-knacks, paint-brushes, and beautifully-pressed art paper (too many to choose from!).On our visit there back in April, we bought 2 x beautiful acrylic paintings (on canvas) from a street artist, sized roughly 1200x600mm, for about $300 (after some bargaining). Note: if there is a price tag, they are usually not negotiable. Take an easy stroll along the area, stop for coffee/ tea and desserts, and shop for local gems."
Interesting,"What an interesting area to walk around. Culture, food and clothing in typical Korean settings. The area is normally crowded."
A must visit,Great shopping area for Korean knick knacks. Must visit ssamziegil. A charming shopping complex/building of artisan shops. It was fun going to the little shops but be careful not to touch items randomly or you will be told off in a not so pleasant way by some of the store keepers ( I.e. the music box store lady). I will visit again and I highly recommend.
Johnny Cash and Artisans,"I was told Insadong is the place for souvenirs. This is true. There are many booths, kiosks and such that sell the standard Korean goodies. Fans, compact mirrors, magnets, socks etc etc…You walk into one, you walk into all of them because many of them have the same stuff. But there is something much more attractive about Insadong. There is such a unique blend of consumers and proprietors on this stretch. Watching them work and interact with with the customers is a treat in itself. Performers, fried food chefs, kiddies, parades…its magic! When I travel I always make a point to buy jewelry and coffee mugs. On the main stretch of Insadong, much of the pottery is the same from store to store unfortunately, so nothing struck me as unique. But as I am walking I here Folsom Prison Blues blasting. Intrigued, I follow the music and see a kiosk I hadn't seen last time I was in Insadong. I see an older Korean artisan, with a full head of wavy sliver hair. He's hammering away at copper, creating something. I immediately walk over. Beautiful rings, necklaces, peace signs, beads, earrings and more created by his hand. Awesome! He was friendly, engaging and his personality was so magnetic I stood at his stall conversing with him for over 30 minutes! Ray Charles then starts crooning from his radio…Of course I bought a few peaces, and when I left he smiled big, shook my hand and said ""Be Happy.""This is why Insadong is worth the trip. You will cross paths with many, natives and travelers, with such varied backgrounds that offer something unique and personal to the area. You can't help but fall in love with the place!Note: Sundays are crowded, but nice because they always have dances or performers around. Fun to just people watch. Lovely place to take a stroll. There are lots of wonderful musicians and the area is very scenic and all around enjoyable."
"A Tourist Trap, But Still Worth Visiting","Insadong is a tourist trap. But it is a charming tourist trap with some quaint shops, decent restaurants, and cool street performances to see. Definitely worth a visit when you are in Seoul."
Nice Old Market & Art Gallareys,"Like: Traditional goods, prices are avarege and very good srrounding markets also. most seelers speaks English.Disliked: Most Shops close by 5-6 pm, you have to barginig for cheaper price or discounts."
place to buy souvenirs,You can buy souvenirs of Korea. It has Korean toys with traditional dress. Every thing is expensive but it has worth for its price. Just walk around the street to see many small beautiful shops. A lot of people are walking around.
review of insadong,There are lots of shops and restaurants. There are lovely treasure finds! It's a bit busy most of the time. 
Good for Shopping & Food,"This street is really good for cheap souvenirs if your into that kind of thing, I also found a good kitchen shop where I got some tableware for very cheap prices. Its not a huge street but its definitely busy, full of places of eat and shops. I ate here twice and you really have to be careful as one of the places I ate made me very unwell for a few days. Good if your walking from some of palaces/temples back through to Jongno way and fancy a bite to eat. Some good street eats along here as well. Worth a look, but very touristy!"
"Ok, but kind of like a tourist trap","There are many antique shop and souvenir shop lining the streets of Insadong. I gave 4 stars because we had a great time in a tea house tucked in a back alley away from the horrifying crowd behind Ssamzie-gil mall, which has some interesting shops too (but quite unbearable in the sweltering weather of summer due to its open-space structure). Other than that, it's just regular street food stalls, skin care shops and faux-antique. "
Very nice. Lots of shopping and eating.,We stayed at the Sunbee Hotel which is in the middle of Insadong gil and so walked this street every day.Lots of arts and crafts and souvenirs and more pricey items. Some really nice galleries. My wife bought a lot of small souvenirs here. Lots of Korean deserts and sweets to try.Can be done in a couple of hours but I would recommend taking it slow and spending more time here. I would also suggest exploring the side streets and surroundings. There is an old quarter close by with some interesting alleyways and small buildings (between the main street and Jonggak subway station).Try the large ice cream desert (big bow full of assorts of things) at the cafe at the top of the Ssamzie-gil complex. Some very nice shops here too.Try the dumplings at the dumpling bar on Insadong 7-gil (The one with a sign showing a women holding hands with an octopus).The Alive Museum (similar to Trickeye) is worth a visit.Make time for Jogyesa Temple and Unhyyeongung Palace which are nearby.We found Insadong cheaper than Myeongdong for gifts and souvenirs.
A good place to shop for korean souvenirs,"The insadong area has lots of shops selling traditional korean souvenirs. There, you can buy paintings, handicrafts, and other little souvenirs that ypu can take home. You can in fact walk from bukchon hanok village to insadong and enjoy the street graffitti along the way."
love it here,"“Shop Till You Drop for the Ladies” great place to buy souvenirs , and lots of kpop stuff....................."
"Nice street with art, crafts and tourist souvenir shops","Nice street with art, crafts and tourist souvenir shops. However, much of this stuff you can get elsewhere in the city as well so I'm not sure its the must visit place some describe it as."
Cool area to walk around,We came here for lunch after visiting the Hanok village and one of the nearby palaces. There are lots of restaurants and shops. The shops range from boutique to simple cafés. Young people floc to the area giving it a dynamic vibe. One of the most enjoyable neighborhoods in Seoul that we visited. 
Cheaper than Myeongdong.,"If you're looking for things you could bring home then go here. Cheaper than Myeongdong (which is a shopping district) and I like the choices here better (because it's a market). The souvenirs are mostly touristy but there are still items (mostly food) that I like such as the walnut cake, Korean taffy and the very cheap nuts.Vendors are friendly. It's common to hear vendors shouting some foreign phrases and if you turn your head then they'd know you're nationality.The place is clean. I also noticed that most stores closed before sun down. I found more tourists here than in Myeongdong."
Nice authentic place to eat candy.,"When you have a lot of time, visit the street , it's a nice area with shops they make sugar candies with almond, you will to see how candy makers work, it is a fun show. There is a nice big tea shop if you are a tea lover. Many restaurants available with no waiting needed. The area is not crowded, it has enough space for all.Small food stands sell varieties of street food nicely presented.We hired taxi to get there.A really enjoyable place, have fun!"
Fun Fun Fun!!,"Great area in the centre of Seoul. Lots of restaurants, bars and shops. Antiques, souvenirs, clothing...just about anything. Love the fact that the street is closed to traffic so one can freely venture around. Lots to see in the side streets alleys as well so do not stay just in the main throughway. There was some street performers too which added another element of fun to the experience."
Good for Souvenir Shopping,"Insadong is the perfect place for souvenir shopping. You can also find restaurant, cafe, arts, crafts and food stalls there. Do try the O'Sulloc tea shop and cafe and hotteok (sweet pancake with brown sugar filling). When shopping for souvenir, do try to bargain and shop around as most shop carry the same products."
Another Great Place for Shopping in Seoul,"Just same as Meyongdong, Insadong is another great place for you to taste many variants of Korean foods and hunting for Korean branded stuff or unique Korean souvenirs. I visited Insadong at lunch time on weekday, so it's more likely more crowded by Koreans."
"Small shopping Area, Loads of good food!",There are loads of restaurants for you to eat at here along with coffee shops. Some street stalls selling different things as well as little shops for you to have a look round. We had some amazing food in Insadong!
"Aimed at the tourist, but still a good time","Went here for an afternoon visit and to do some shopping with a korean guide. It's definitely a mix of different levels of shops/restaurants/bars -- some of the stores have very pricey things, others the typical tourist stuff of postcards, trinkets, and the like. But there are several art galleries scattered along the area, as well as the occasional reasonably priced pottery shop, and it does make for a pleasant afternoon's stroll. Bonus tip: Head on over to the Buddhist Temple nearby, the largest in Korea, for a view of some great statutes and a calming courtyard!"
Totally Artistic!,I liked the various art shops; this is the place to get artistic stuff and see street baskers and artists. Very interesting and happening place! 
Perfect street for traditionnal korean souvenirs,"That street is the only street I found in 3 weeks with traditionnal korean souvenirs. Everything else is fashion shoppin which I really don't see the point when visiting a foreign country. I bought all my souvenirs but one here. A blessing that I found that street. Lots of food, cheap to expensive souvenirs. There is pretty much of everything and it is very close to big touristic attractions. A must do!"
Fun street to buy souvenirs or just walking around!,"The street is full with souvenirshops and local restaurants! Try some local food (long icecream-thing, fried hamsausage in fishdough, cinamon pitabread etc.) You also see some tourist-street-artists which is nice to see and listen to.When I was there, there was this ""South Korea promo"" and you could take a picture in traditional clothing for free! Nice experience."
My favorite place during our vacation.,"Everything you need! Close to palaces and other great attractions. Shopping on many levels, from cheap tourist trinkets to very expensive glass and all in between. Plenty of great place for authentic Korean food."
good to see however expected more,there were too many tourist target souvenir shops and kids running around everywhere. They did have nice spots to relax and eat
nice matrket place,"there is many souvenirs shops, so for sure you can find something to buy, and not only one souvenir (many)...you can try some unusual food here, if there is a food market this day - I'm lucky..."
Good shops and great dining,"Although I am not a big shopper I quite enjoyed the vibe of this district even with the rain about.. We stopped for dinner and lunch inside this district on two days and was not let down.. Wall to wall shopping and food is the best way to describe this area.. There are also local tourist maps in English and access to ATM Machines.. Although most seem to only give you 100$ USD at a time in $10,000won increments.."
One of my fave areas in Seoul,"I love this area! It's a little different from other shopping areas because it has all the traditional and modern tea shops. It's just got a little more ""Korean"" to it than some of the other shopping areas. "
Nice place for shopping and eating,I particularly liked the mixture of shopping for typical Korean design or handicraft articles and a lot of very good small typical restaurants with excellent food. 
Art and accessories shop,"If you like to buy art and antique new porcelain, this is the place you should go. The are has also many shops selling accessories such key chain, painting, and souvenir. The price is reasonable and if you are lucky you can have a good bargain."
Insadong,Very upmarket street. Lovely to visit - nice art work - pottery. Food places also MacDonald. Also souvenir shops. Seats scattered around nice for people watching. Well worth a visit.
Souvenirs and tourist restaurants,This area is full of souvenir shops where you can buy plenty of items ranging from expensive teapots to random plastic tat. The street is very busy but if you take a side-street you quickly find yourself in a quieter area.There are plenty of places to eat around here including vegetarian restaurants. Being in the tourist area the prices seem to double in comparison to the street running parallel.If you want gifts or to see an art gallery then this is a good place.
Cultural street,"Love the culture and art environment. You can find many good local souvenirs around. Some of the shops offer great items with great price. So, do find out those hidden gems! "
Cool artsy place,"This place is very artsy - pop art shops, caricatures, handcrafted souvenirs. There is a nice Buddhist vegetarian restaurant called Sanchon which also serves amazing rice wine btw :) Spend an afternoon walking along the alleys and immerse in the artsy culture of Korea!"
Nice walking street,"It is a nice walking street full of tourist shops, to buy souvenirs, the alleys surrounding it have more appeal, narrow streets full of restaurants and nice traditional houses. Pretty stroll, but enough to walk down the street once."
Love this place as there are many vegan/vegetarian eateries,There are at least 4 vegetarian eateries in Insadong and this is like Haven to me because it's quite difficult to find vegan/vegetarian food in Korea. It's a pity that I didn't have the chance to explore all the vegetarian restaurants. Would love to do so should I visit Korea again. There was a traditional wedding reenactment performance when I visited Insadong in June. The show put up by the performers were fantastic! I was really mesmerized by the rich Korean culture!
The usual travel trinket shopping avenue,The atmosphere in Insadong is great - I got a glimpse of a number of live performers. Even those selling sweets put on a show! It is busy and there is nothing overly unusual about what you can buy there. It must be said that the prices of the trinkets were lower here than anywhere else in Busan or Jeju.
Trashy junk...gotta do it,Don't expect much...but it is a nice stroll through the trinket shops and hawkers.Cafés and coffee shops abound...look down the side alleys for some awesome food options for quite cheap
Craft and handmade products,"This is the perfect place to buy souvenirs and gifts to bring home for friends or relatives. There were stores plus little tables out on the sidewalks selling items. There were coffee shops, restaurants, and ice cream shops with unusual sellections that were delicious. It is very crowded, and you need two to three hours to wander around to appreciate the area."
Place to buy souvenirs in Seoul,"Many kind of souvenirs sold cheap there, you can even bargain or they will give you discount without you asking if you buy more than 3 items."
Great place to visit with great tofu and tea!,"Insadong is one of the places you have to come when you visit Korea. One of the cleanest tasting Tofu dishes I have ever had was here (Insadong Soft Tofu 인사동 순두부 in case your wondering). Try the teahouses also. There was this one called ""Moonbird only think of moon"" 달새는 달만 생각한다. If you speak Korean or some, the owner is nice to talk to!"
Just ok,"After walking in Myeongdong and Namdaemun, wasn't as excited by Insodong. It was just ok. Liked the stores and deals better at other places."
Art Meets Shopping,This area was close to my hotel so I was able to explore it several times. Lots of interesting galleries and shops containing lots of art and crafts. Many interesting food opportunities as well. Some street performers at times. A good place to find small trinkets to take home for friends and family.
"Great shopping, artsy area","Lots of art galleries and craft stores here, plus a nice selection of places to get local cuisine, treats and snacks. Don't miss the Turkish Ice Cream guys."
"Attractive, inauthentic, and overpriced.","I really struggled with how to rate this place. There are so many things I love about it, and other things that are very ""meh"" about it. I like that you can find almost any iconic Korean souvenir that you could possibly want.... I dislike that they're overpriced, and that some of them are made in China.I like that they have a good range of street food... I dislike that it's (again) overpriced, and the quality of what I've tried was not as good as other places.I like that the signs are in Korean... But then again, it's there to appeal to me, right? I think the tourists appreciate the appearance of (and pictures with) the signs way more than Koreans might.I love the dojangs (personalized name stamps) that I easily picked up for my brother and his wife. No complaints there.Bottom line: It's attractive, but in a very inauthentic way. It seems kind of like going to Epcot, where everything is made to mirror a certain culture, yet doesn't quite feel like you're actually there. Most of the visitors are tourists, and most of the shopkeepers will converse with you in English. Is it a must see? Yes. Is it a place you'll want to visit often? Probably not."
Interesting and lively.,"I went to Insadong at night and found it very interesting with plenty of shops, stalls and restaurants. I thought the whole place had a fun vibe to it. Highly recommended."
Art of Seoul,"You can buy lots of art things in this place. it's like Myeongdong but it's famous for art. try to take a look because there are lots unique building.my suggestion : don't buy souvenir in here, because it's more expensive than in Namdaemun.but if you want to buy special things such us tradition things, this is the best place. i bought a traditional hat of Korea (called gat in Korean) in here. don't forget to visit ssaemzigil. it's like a mall which is selling art design things."
Worth a look,An interesting place to have a look around and shop for souvenirs. We went late Sunday morning and was pleasantly surprised to find it wasn't crowded at all. 
The must-see district of Seoul,"Get lost in the small streets of the Insadong area ; stop for a while, push a door and enter a small traditional restaurant where you can get genuine local food for a very reasonable price..."
"""traditional"" area of Seoul","Small streets crammed with shops, cafés and so on, near to several of the main palaces. Very interesting to look around."
Soul of art,"If you are the person are loving art, this is the place you should not miss it. It is the place where the majority local and western tourist who like to visit. Full of artistic feel around and make visitor can feel relax and enjoying during shop along. This is not a good place for shopping where majority gather all artistic material such like drawing, clay and some hand made products."
Loved Insadong,we bought lots of celadon pottery and souvenirs while here. the people were so friendly. i just wish we could have stayed longer!!!
Crowded Shopping,"This is one of the densest areas of the world that I've ever been in. There's wall to wall people in the shopping area and it could be a little overwhelming. I was able to buy a bunch of souvenirs for my friends and family here, but I probably won't return if I'm back in Seoul."
Great place to buy Amythst stone jewelry!,"Lots of great shopping of more tradtional products such as art and pottery. Many restaurants, street food and of course traditional tea houses."
Get a korean seal,"Nice zone to check local crafts. You can find korean seals handmade or cnc machined, the second one is cheaper the first one makes more sense if you want a nice souvenir for yourself."
Crowded but pleasent,"On Sundays and holidays you can hardly move there, but there is so much to see and buy, and the Korean peoplr are so nice amd coureous that it seems to be a must: Insadong on Sunday,"
Culture Shopping,"If you want to buy something that is not the usual tourist typing gift, go to Insadong. This is a shopping district which features hand crafted art and specialized teas. You do not want to go here if you're looking for T-shirts and knock off Coach purses. You can get some of the traditional Korean green pottery here, but I would recommend going to one of the street vendors outside of Itaewon for that."
Great shopping area for the arts.,When in korea dont forget to visit this place. Can be reached by Train from anywhere in Seoul. This is also where you could buy tickets for the Nami Island Trip.
"trinkets, tea and many more...","I have been here twice during my one week stay in Korea last April 2014. I never get tired of going around the shops and there are many interesting stuffs here. If you are a tea lover, you will find a big tea variety shop... Food trip also must try here.. Do not miss this place when you go to Seoul."
Best place to shop for traditional Korean items,"Went to Insadong without much expectations but the place proved to be the best place to shop in seoul. Prices are reasonable and to some vendors you can bargain also. All kinds of traditional Korean things like ceramics, necklaces, drrsses, handicrafts etc. were there. Lots to choose from."
Love this place!,It's a tradisional market and the street is closed to traffic on Sundays. You get to experience a lot of tradisional food and we tried out at 2 of the restaurants there and the food was delicious!Recommended to go there as the things sold there are different from the other shopping streets
Great place to try Hanbok!,My tourist guide fix the hanbok rental here and the service and hanbok were spectacular! The staffs were really friendly and the hanbok is colourful and bright! We're really satisfied with the service. Highly recommended as they have cute hanbok for my year old daughter too!!
Its so korean culture,"If you wants to buy art and craft of korean style this is where you should be looking for them... Its just so all korean stuff... Ceramics of korean tradition style, tea house, korean tradional clothing and plenty more. Do give more ample time to venture to the small alleys as you still find good antiques shops. And when the time your stomach growls at you.... Dont worry as you can easily find plenty of traditional korean restaurant that serves you with extra ordinary dishes fit for a king."
A Real Treat,I absolutely love this shopping area of Seoul-- so much so that I returned for another visit. Great tea houses and interesting Korean shops line the street. A great glimpse into Seoul and a must see for everyone visiting. Check side streets for inviting little restaurants. Lots of touristy things-- yet still worthwhile to see!
The place of Korean Souvenirs,if you looking for korean souvenirs this is the place. from Hanbok (traditional korean dress) to the keychain are here.
Food and Shopping!,"Although I wasn't in Seoul to shop, if shopping is what you want, this is the place! Beautiful shops including clothing, pottery/ceramics, souvenirs, food stalls, speciality tea, crafts etc and little side streets with gorgeous restaurants"
Souvenir Street,"Rows of souvenir shops align the street. Quality of souvenirs are average, head to a modern souvenir shop. O Sulloc Tea House and Ssamgil are the best experiences "
Quaint street where all signs are in Korean,If you like Korean souvenirs and craft then Insadong is for you. There are several lovely restaurants off the main road which offers authentic korean food.
Relax and take in the sights in Insadong,"I love Insadong! It's a really busy part of Seoul (where isn't?) because it is popular with tourists and Koreans. The difference is that everyone walks at a slow and leisurely rate, taking in the sights, sounds and smells. I love the wide cobblestone street and the beautiful trees. I love that when you look up you're always surprised with something quirky and new. Go down the side alleys for boutique stores, arts and crafts and cute little tea rooms which are less commercial than on the main street. We've stayed at a motel in Insadong twice and loved being in the area. Close to a few different subways where you can store your luggage in a locker if you've been shopping."
Lovely arty place to walk,"Great to explore this place in the late afternoon to evening as it won't be too hot.Lots of arty type boutiques and cafes to explore so much so that there's too many interesting, unique things to explore! Streets are full of shops selling all kinds of knick-knacks and you'll be hard-pressed to move along quickly.Suggest to devote 1/2 a day to explore this area."
of Cafes and Coffee,Here is the place where you will find unique cafes and good coffees. Shop the day away for arty stuff here :) 
"touristy place, must visit.","A touristy place and overly priced but must visit as there's just too many interesting stuff there to ignore. Good atmosphere, nice walk and good place to hangout with fellow tourist having a drink. Lots of restaurants, concentrated at that street, beautifully designed and hidden within the alleys. Just hard to pick one that you want to try."
Korean arts and crafts,"This is a must visit for tourists. The streets are full of little shops selling everything from high end art to little souvenirs. I purchased a beautiful print which was so well packaged for travel home at no extra expense. I also bought lots of little korean purses.There are plenty of places to eat and you can even buy a cocktail in a plastic bag - shopping and cocktails, you had me at hello!"
"Arty, bohemian","Full of really interesting shops, restaurants and tea shops. Try the jujube or omija teas...very good. The art galleries are real quality and it's a nice place to spend an afternoon"
"Touristy, but interesting","Insadong is basically an eclectic shopping area with lots of ""traditional"" restaurants geared towards tourists. We explored the Ssamgil building, which is a four story winding mecca of expensive handmade boutiques. "
Tourist Shopping,"This is one of the best places for tourist shopping. Several of the shops sale the same thing so don't always buy from the first shop you see. This wasn't exactly the best place for food although you can get you some nice things to munch on. To help tourist out, there is an information center located at each end of the street. Happy shopping!"
One of my favorite places,"Art street, tea houses, tourists, souveniers - Insadong has it all. I enjoy the tea houses the most and particularly in winter."
Very clean!!!!,"I loved it here!!!! Though more stores can be found in Myeong Dong, this place has its own vibe. Even if you don't plan to buy anything, just go here and feel the ""korean"" in you. Very nice place to stroll, to eat and shop ofcourse"
"Full of life, Lots of shops to choose from",I really like Insadong. there are lots of shops to choose from but the area is less crowded than myeongdong. Lots of calligraphy stores and antique shops. 
Great experience!,"A great place for souvenirs, wide vairiety and were also cheaper than other places. Not so much on skincare but a lot of unique brands and items that can be seen there. Overall was an interesting experience."
Great area!!,"I have visited Insadong a number of times and each time have enjoyed it just as much as the first time. The main street running right through is full of interesting little shops. People who are interested in Art will be in their heaven as there are so many art shops and galleries in the area. If one goes off the big road, there are numerous little places to eat and best of all are the little tea shops. The latter are so quaint and very olde worldie. The decor is so different and they serve the most amazing types of teas, the variety is just too big to mention, but the orange one is so good, with almost marmalade at the bottom. There used to be a very quaint one with birds flying around the shop, but this one does seem to have closed down. The main road and area has all been revamped of late, making it more pleasant to amble about!! Really does deserve a visit!"
Favorite shopping by far,This artsy area was my favorite place to shop. Classy higher end handmade thing. Look for Kooning for dumplings
Interesting,interesting sourvenirs you can get there. some are expensive and some are reasonable. many cafes too.
Awesome shopping!,"We loved Insadong, and came back here a few times during our trip. There are so many cute stalls and shops with kitschy/artsy stuff to buy. There are also some nice cafes/bakeries. Would definitely recommend!"
Must go,Lots variety of items and products. Lots of local product and foods. Price are more reasonable here. 
A street with everything,"If you go on a Sunday - no cars just pedestrians strolling through a great authentic shopping street. This area has a mix that covers the ages. From old antique shops that line the alleys, through to the young fashion shops along the main drag. There must be something for everyone..... look out for the boys making the Kings Dessert - their performance surely the next West End show? Worst ways, have a coffee in one of the many many coffee emporiums and watch the world go by"
Traditional souvenirs,"The place is best to visit during Sundays since they close the road for traffic and more vendors will setup around the street. You will find a lot of traditional items that you can take home as souvenir of your trip. You'll also enjoy some street arts around and cheap street foods. There are also a lot of restaurants and cafés around. When you're done with your shopping, cross the main street near Anguk Station and it will lead you to Bukchon and Samcheondong area for a great view of traditional hanok houses and lovely cafés."
Fun Place to see Traditional Korean souvenirs,Another tourist course. Many great Korean restaurants and tea houses are present on side streets. Take your time and enjoy what's happening on the street and pop in local shops and take some samples. Enjoy traditional Korean dishes and desserts such as ttoek (rice cake spelled as 떡) and tea.
For souvenirs,"If you're looking for Korean souvenirs, this is the place to go. Plenty of tea things too.Don't forget to take a photo in front of Starbucks! It's banner is spelled out in Hangul."
Korean's Shoreditch,It feels like in London's Shoreditch once I stepped in Insadong area. There are boutiques and restaurants offer you an unique experience. Some art's installation are appeared in few spots.
nothing special,"nothing special in Insadong or may be we were not in the rights places: lot of people, trendy restaurant .... "
Great place to shop for trinkets or get great food,"Loved this place! Make sure to make this a priority visit when in Seoul. Tons of shops of every kind, and restaurants of every flavor. Stop and people watch...youll love it."
Mixed of traditional and modern,i love the melting pot ambience where you can find every thing from a traditional art to a modern art items!
Vibrant Insadong,"Insadong-Gil my favourite street in Seou!. We stayed in the See Bee Hotel just off Insadong so I visited it frequently. It is such a vibrant place, full of all kinds of shops and stalls, from cheap nick-nack stalls to high quality shops. There were heaps of restaurants of varying quality and prices, art galleries, tea houses everything you could want. My favourite were the young men making a traditional sweet Yong Su Yeom spun from honey. They had a wonderful patter which switched from Korean to English according to their audience and their sweets were delicious. I paused by their stall so many times they were greeting me personally in the end.The street is mainly pedestrian although in the morning some cars are using it, but it is a case of pedestrian rules. Although I was on the street every day for four days I am sure I only explored a small part of it. Earlier in the day it is less crowded."
Always fun to walk and shop.,"The Insadong area of Seoul is the older quaint part of town. It is part of the Jongno district of Seoul. The Main Street that everyone gravitates to is Insadong-Gil, which runs from Tapgol Park near Jongno-ga up to Angkuk dong. Off this street (Gil) are many small alleys filled with small shops, restaurants and tea shops. This area is very crowded when people leave work 5-6:00 till about 9:00 when lots of shops start closing down, 10:00 or so on weekends and later for some restaurants and bars. It has a huge amount of cosmetic and skin care shops which are all very competitive. A great place to shop if looking for these items. Please see my previous review for more info. I enjoy staying in this area and walking this street. It is always fun. Lots of performers on weekends but be warned it is very crowded."
"A great place to walk around, shop, and have a tea ceremony!","I went here with my mother and some friends. We walked around a bought gifts for friends and family back home. The area is beautiful. Every where you turn there is something to see and buy. We wanted to see if we could find an old tea house ( it wasn't hard, they are everywhere) we picked one that was super small but beautiful. I ordered a pear and quince tea, my mother ordered a simple green tea. We sat in a small section with a huge window looking out on to the busy street. the atmosphere was lovely and felt nostalgic for times long since past. The hostess showed us the proper way to prepare tea. The tea was delicious. We spent hours walking up and down the street. There were street performers in the square and even a small temple not to far up. I love this place and I go back often. The lantern festival is a must!"
Great Tea Museum!,"I love Insadong and what I love most about it is this quaint Tea Museum on one of the side streets. There is also a collection of great vegetarian restaurants there. I found myself there at least once every two months or so. Insadong is the traditional arts center of Seoul. It's an extreme tourist spot; therefore, also very pricey, but there are so many gems to be found if you look and can haggle in Korean. "
Fun to see what the Koreans market!,"It was a bit touristy, but still gave you the chance to see the many, many things the Koreans market. It felt totally safe and was entertaining."
Great insight into Korean culture.,"This is the only place where Starbucks is actually spelled in Hangul, the Korean phonetic language. Its a little street that you can walk down and see monks, get some cultural insight and great street food. A must see for any Seoul visit. If you have 24 hours, this is the place to go. "
Best shopping in the city,"From mass produced souvenirs to hand crafted art, you'll find it all in this very funky shopping district. The vibe here is so different than the other shopping areas. Don't miss the building with with ramps instead of stairs!"
Bargains,"If you want to shop for souvenirs, this is the place to shop. Aside from souvenirs, you can also find here traditional korean artcrafts. This is one of the best place to wander and eat street food. The place is clean and there are lots of korean restaurants to choose from."
Nice but commercialised,"Insadong wasn't exactly what I expected. (I was hoping to see hanoks and traditional buildings) Nonetheless, it was still a pleasant area to walk around in. It's quite commercialised and locals know it as a tourist trap. Souvenirs here are a little pricey. I'd recommend getting similar ones at Namdaemun market instead as it'll be cheaper. (A pack of ten hanbok teddy keychains cost 20,000 won. I got mine at namdaemun for 14,000!)Most of the shops here close quite early. By night time, you might find some buskers performing in the area. "
A look into traditional Korean crafts,Insadong is a tourist area with lots of shops and restaurants. Wandering the side streets is a good break from ultra modern Seoul. With few must see sights in this city InsaDong is a nice break and a view into old Seoul!
Colourful but crowded and touristy place,"I would say this is a must visit for first time travellers to Seoul. It is bustling with activity and boasts a festive atmosphere especially on weekends, when the roads are closed to traffic. Besides souvenirs and antiques, there are some good buys like bags, and snacks. Just bear with jostling with the huge crowd."
The best street in Jongno,"Full of souvenir shops, cosmetic stores, Cafés, money changers, and restaurants. Usually comes alive in the afternoon with plenty of tourists "
Enchanting,A really enchanting place with beautiful architecture and artistic atmosphere. Perfect for souvenir hunting.
VERY KOREAN,"Only there a few days, but it is great for eating and shopping, the place is very lively and it is good spot to catch a beer or coffee and watch the world (seoul ) pass by."
Touristy area with lots of little shops. Nice atmosphere.,"Very touristy shops selling a lot of souvenirs and antiques. The atmosphere is festive, especially on weekends. But many items are priced for tourists. "
Nice little street of tourist shops and places to eat,We stumbled across this place looking for somewhere to ear near our hotel. Its nice with some tea of coffee shops and korean restaurants. I wouldnt travel far ro come here specifically but if you are staying locally it is a good place to wonder around and find something to eat or drink
Touristy and crowded yet a must see!,"Yeap, touristy like there is no tomorrow, BUT I really loved Insadong and went back again for more photo ops of random shops and people, there was a cafe i was looking for and I couldnt find it, apparently its on the 2nd floor and they let little birds fly around while you drink your coffee! (if anyone has been here let me know what it was like lol)The majority of the shops are really touristy souvenir shops so i would suggest to buy them from here as they seemed to be reasonably priced (similar to other places around seoul)"
A bit disappointing,I thought I would see lots of antique shops here but it mostly seems to have tourist souvenir shops. Maybe I didn't go looking far enough. I gather there are tea shops too but I didn't come across much in Insadong-Gil (the Main Street)
Worth a 1-2 hour walk around,"Insadong is decisively not the cheapest place to go on a souvenir-hunt, however if you see some small ceramics or artisan-made objects which you like - jump on them. Nearly everything is hand-made and won't be found enywhere else.Also, in Insadong Tourist Information point you can try on traditional clothes for an extremely low sum and take photos on a background of a real old traditional building (and not a poster of a building, as in most of the places)"
Looking for locally made souvenir?,"Amongst the many trinkets on display, purses, mother of pearl, clothing, etc. beware of what is 'Made in China'. There is so much to see and buy and eat. Restaurants and Tea Houses can be found in alleys. "
Amazing!,"If you are ready to be immersed into the culture then you MUST go here! It was so much fun seeing all the different foods and shops that clearly represent traditional Korea! You must eat here and try the local traditional 'Korean Pancake"" (which from my understanding differs from district to district - which provided me an excuse to try this many times) and it was delicious! the Korean people were so friendly and were putting on shows allowing us an insight into how the local foods/goods were made. It really is a must see experience and very easy to get to (off the metro)."
Great shopping,Higher quality products here than other markets. Nice pottery. Was very crowded but it was a public holiday. Some shops are air conditioned which was nice on a 31oC day. Most shops take credit cards as we'll. 
Nice place,"I only walked on the main street which is design for tourist. I found that the souvenirs in Insadong have a larger variety then other places. The sign for the alley are very traditional, I guess it is worth exploring."
Shopping street,You can find many traditional Korean stuff here. Small souvenirs and traditional meal! Worth trying 
shopping street,"fancy street, many shops, everything to buy, pretty mocal stuff, a very nice walk up to the palace, cosmetic, food, close, jewel, china"
Nice place!,"We had this on our list and though it would be a respite from the shopping. But turns out there are things to buy here too! Its a really nice street brimming with cute shops alongside the touristy ones - I bought tea bags here. Especially nice is this 3-4 level shopping building right smack in the middle of the area which looks especially nice at night. God for a after dinner walk particularly in cold weather! To get here, take subway to Anguk station (line 3-orange), exit 6. Or Jonggak Station(종각역), line 5-purple, exit 3."
Soul Shoppin' in Seoul,"Insadong is the go-to area for local arts and crafts and souvenirs. One can spend at least half a day going from shop to shop and just looking at all of the local crafts, from pottery, to artwork, to local Korean fashion where tradition meets modern. You can also find your tacky tourist shop, but this is not the majority in Insadong. I don't recommend the bars in the area as they are price-gouging. Insadong is where you go to shop for local crafts. Oh...and you can buy/eat these odd yellow phallic coned things that they pump ice cream into. Hey...when in Rome, do as the Romans, right? It was an experience to say the least."
Definitely worth a Saturday afternoon,Could say 'a little touristy'. I would say great action and activity. Place was buzzing and had a lot of fun. Of course can tuck into many nice little restos and cafés. Don't hesitate to spend a few hours sauntering down this nice little street and area
A must-go area,"I go to Insadong everytime I visit Seoul. There are a lot of traditional tea houses, restaurants, shops selling traditional and modern crafts and interesting things. If you want to buy some traditional items as souvenirs, this is the place to go. The price is higher than in Namdaemun but the things in Insadong are of much better quality and variations."
Good placce for shopping,"You can walk to maijor places or take a taxi to most of famous shopping centre with low cost. I had stayed 4 nites at this area and quite enjoin with this location, especially at night you can take some local bbq food with Sochu Wine. This is also good place to buy sourvenirs for family or friends "
Traditional to the exotic,Do expect a bargain here as they seem to cater for the tourist but if you want traditional Korean souvenir then this is the place. Step off the main roads and wander down the tight alley ways to find the little family shops and restaurants
Shops and art,This is quite a buzzing place with tons of souvenir shops interspersed with some interesting peaceful art galleries. Ssamzie-Gil is an interesting arcade with shops on different levels and a rather bedraggled roof garden with giraffes! The cafe at the top has a lane way full of love messages. Round the corner at the top you find theJogyesa temple full of colourful lantern and chanting monks and further down at the other end isTapgol park with a pagoda and other temple relics.
Must Go To Place,We stopped by Insadong after a walk in the Secret Garden. This is a good stop for the more unusual gifts to bring home. Ssamziegil Mall is particularly worth a visit as it houses a lot of little shops that sell unique items from the artists themselves. Some artist-pottersalso maintain a shop here & there are galleries where you can pick up local art as well. There are many eateries & restaurants in the area too.
Picking up small souvenirs,Insa-dong is worth a visit when stopping by Seoul for a few days. The shops are full of various souvenirs and a wide range of 'stuff' at various prices can be purchased here for those needing that small gift for someone back home.There are many shops and restaurants in the area as well as a few tea houses. I liked the museum of tea in one of the alley ways as we always stop by to pick up something there when we visit.Total visit doesn't take more than a hour or two if you are browsing in many of the shops.
Stroll around while looking at unique Korean handicraft,"Insadong is one of a kind. You will never get bored strolling around its street, there are so many different items, and I had fun just looking and admiring them (I did not buy any of it though). There are volunteers around to ask if you get lost, but you wont. It is a nice place to stop buy."
Cultural shopping,"Insadong Shopping is more cultural shopping. Once having a lot of antique stores as locals got rid of old stuff to upgrade to more modern things, it represented the focal point of Korean traditional culture and crafts; there used to be lots of antique shops but now they have lots of galleries among other things."
For Korean Souvenir,Insadong is a place where you an find mostly Korean souvenirs n Korean style fashion wear! A little bit on the expensive side - so we just went there to see the place - just bought some one of a kind hand made purses :-) serious shopping is at Dongdaemon :-) 
Fun little area,"you have to go to the traditional tea house. We really enjoyed just walking up and down the street. It doesn't take long, unless you go in every single shop."
Sweet souvenir therapy!,"A very nice place for your souvenir hunt! Lots of cheap stuffs like keychain, nail clippers, shirts, and even K-pop goodies! If you're around the vicinity, do try the Korean traditional sweets called Yongsuyeom or dragon-beard sweets ^^ sometimes the maker even sang to you while making it, which is kinda fun :)Make sure not to overspend!"
A place for arts,"We love walking around Insadong. The shops have so much to offer though expensive. If you are an arts person, this is recommended to be part of your itinerary. "
Loved this place!!,"This part of town was one of the highlights of our trip to Seoul! There are plenty of shops, restaurants and when we were there street performers. It is a very fun atmosphere and pottery is considerably cheaper here than any other place we saw! Look for a giant statue of a calligraphy bush and you are at the entrance! There is a main street with all the action but, side streets have a lot to offer as well. Dragon's Beard is a delicious, unique treat found in very few places- there are booths here that sell it - buy it!!"
Worth a visit,"Insadong is a great suburb/city in seoul Lots of shopping and food areas, it can get really busy on the weekendsI recommend you probably need a few hours here"
Good place to shop,Many shops in the area and you also have many choices for gifts to buy. Nice food too at the restaurants.
Best part of Seoul,"I have been coming to Korea regularly since 1978 and Insadong remains my favorite part of the city. It is filled with shops, galleries and abundant selection of places to eat. The shows in the galleries change every week or so making it possible to see variety of artists and exhibits.It is becoming more modern but still retains old world charm. With the Main Street blocked to traffic you can wander freely without worrying about cars. My favorite place to spend an afternoon no matter what time of the year..."
Nice shopping area,"Insadong is a nice shopping area with a lot of small shops. Particularly, a lot of local designer T-shirts, accessories, bags, etc. could be found there. The price is a bit expensive since their target customers are tourists. Some restaurants are there as well. Worthwhile a visit to spend around 2-3 hours."
Tourist stop but nice,"There are all the tourist traps here, but it is still a nice place to visit, do some shopping, eat and just stroll."
Nice area to go walking and window shopping (and to eat)!,"I love going to Insadong for several reasons. I typically use Insadong as my starting point for a nice walk, either to Samcheongdong and Gyeongbukgung or Cheonggyecheon Stream. Insadong is also a great place for eating out as there are many restaurants in the area. The best ones are located in the back of the main street in the labyrinth of streets. The last time I went, I was with a friend who has never been to Korea, and we went meandering around the back streets and followed a group of young Chinese travelers who we overheard were going to a popular sujebi restaurant. Since I forgot how to get to the restaurant I went to last time, we decided to follow them and it turned out to be a great find! I don't remember the name of the restaurant but the sujebi soup, the pajeon and the makkeolli were all great. We also walked around, ate hoddeok, and window shopped until we were tired. There are many souvenir shops around this area, but some of the generic souvenirs (like keychains, socks, etc) seemed to be a bit more expensive here. However, there are many specialty shops here too dealing in traditional crafts and unique novelty items. You can get tea sets, clothes made of traditional textiles, name stamps, traditional drawings, etc. Besides restaurants, there's also tons of street food vendors here from sticky ice cream, hoddeok to Korean candies and the usual street food fare so you can never go hungry when you're in this area. Bathroom tip: There's a public restroom across the Olive Young shop underground."
A tourist must + local option,"Having lived in the Seoul area for almost a year, I still believe that Insa is a great place to go even though it can be touristy. There is plenty to see, do, eat, and buy (especially gifts for friends when you visit home, or send to during the holiday time). There's a great dumpling place a little off the main street... Look for the line. Also it's a not-too-far-away-nice walk to the Hanok village."
So much to see (and buy),I could possibly have spent a week poking through all the shops there. Also worth checking out - the Live Museum.
All the Senses!,"What a fun assault on all the senses. Take your time, go in the late afternoon, early evening, and make sure you stop at Tapgol Park on the southern end of the district. "
Art and craft,"We came here on a Sunday where it is turned into a 'mall' as the street is closed off to traffic. This is a street of Korean traditional culture with antique art and book shops, tea houses and handicraft shops etc. There are many opportunities to buy souvenirs here. Be sure to visit Ssamziegil which is a multi level building at the centre of Insadong. Walk up the ramps and browse the shops and at the top you will find a little pathway with two fences filled with 'notes of love'."
Traditional art street with nice cafe,Prefer Insadong than MyeongDong. This street is not so crowded. You can find many nice authentic Korean restaurants with cheap prices as well. However the shopping is expensive there as it mostly sell tourist stuff. Check out the nicely decorated cafes there. Worth a visit!
Crowded shopping street in the center of Seoul,"On a Saturday afternoon, Insadong-gil is a bustling pedestrian shopping street. Lined with stores of various kinds on either side, the street is a paradise for those seeking to buy souvenirs, korean handmade porcelain, or textiles/scarves. The street is also lined with cafés, restaurants and street vendors who sell handmade jewelery or food."
"Fun, artisty area!",Loved this area of Seoul. Beautiful decorations surrounding the temple while I was there and local dances. Great shops and restaurants in the area!
headache place but good for souvenirs,"If you need a quick 2 hours to buy all your souvenirs, this is the place to be, one street with a few side lanes. Does my head in though.. crowded."
Shopping!,"This place has every souvenir item you could think of. Though there are a lot of tourists here, Insadong has a lot to offer, so you won't feel bored."
Tourist but still great! ,"Great atmosphere, relaxing, with at galleries, good food, nice shopping. Love it! One of my favourite :)"
"Great for shopping, gift buying, people watching and dining","We loved Insadong. Within 3 hours, we were able to see some of the local food being sold on the street, get funny socks for gifts, business holders for our office, an iphone case for a friend with Kia Tigers on it, go to a Tea Museum and try wonderful tea, have some of the best dumplings and cold soup I have ever had, have a beer on the 3rd floor and people watch and have fried dough curved and holding ice cream. I am not sure if you could do this anywhere else in the world in such a small amount of space. It is a must see/do while you are in Seoul and can be great for all ages. "
Shopping and Eating,Insa-dong Street is one of the most memorable attractions in Seoul and represents the focal point of Korean traditional culture and crafts. Enjoy the food and buy the local souvenirs there. It was suitable place for those who are shopping lovers and food lovers. Enjoy shopping and eat there. ^^
Over rated and over crowded with tourists,"I visited Insadong in 2008, 2012 and 2014. Each year the number of tourists here just increases. The tea houses tucked in the back alleys are nice and quaint but to navigate through the tourists to get to these are no longer that great a trip. But of course if you have not visited Insadong before, still worth a trip."
Beautiful shopping area!,"This was one of my favorite places in Seoul. The area is filled with local artisans, not cheap stuff. I bought my souvenirs here and went back at least twice more. The area was very clean with a very upbeat atmosphere. The main street had a slightly more European flair than the other shopping areas so I enjoyed very much. The small side streets looked like they had amazing food although I couldn't eat the delicious-looking dumplings and such because I do not eat beef or pork. All the restaurants looked good, clean, and safe to eat. My absolute favorite tea shop was here, called O'sulloc. Make sure you visit if you love tea! Simply amazing!"
Great Location for Walking & Shopping,"Fun place to visit for a nice walk and shopping for souvenirs like phone charms, key chains, masks, clothing etc. very crowded on weekends but fun due to all the activity. We had good ice cream in interesting ice cream ""cones."" Also had delicious fried dough filled with honey, cinnamon and sesame seeds; also had delicious fried small cakes filled with bean paste and nice grilled chicken on a stick. It is a busy area but easy to get to by taxi. Highly recommend, you can walk to other areas in Seoul from here too."
Beautiful street,"Vibrant and cultural street with lot of souvenirs. You can get all sort of Korean souvenirs here with cheap price..I kind of enjoy shopping and the local food here, you will find plenty of restaurants selling local food. Overall, very nice to visit..."
Vibrant but crowded at weekends,"Great place for local Korean arts, crafts and antiques. Insa dong is a vibrant area with many good restaurants and cafes although can be extremely crowded with locals and tourists at weekends.Well worth a visit and amongst Seoul's most interesting shopping areas."
Nice art street....,You can find the art and craft from original Korean. A long the street You can find the souvenir and gift shop... very nice place to art shopping.
A mix of modern and historical!,An area for those that enjoy traditional culture and arts. There is a great atmosphere and feel about the area - many of the signs of restaurants (even Western ones) are in Hangeul. You'll find many food options and outdoor stalls selling snacks. Definitely do as the locals do and try some out. Grab some souvenirs and antiques while you are there!
Love this place!,"I think this is really a place to go. If you can, stay here!A lot of Seoul sights are walkable from it. The feeling of culture is here, the vibe is also very relaxing. There was art installations, street performers, good cafes, shops. A lot of people will be swarming at night to visit Ssamziegil, the place to be. Nice and unique place to shop and hangout and don't forget to take selfie like the rest of Korean youths. Keep walking then you can enjoy more variety of street foods, shops or just people watching."
So much fun!,"Great place to walk around and buy souvenirs, also good street food. Bring comfy shoes and you can walk nearby to the palace!"
Art Crafts,"The street was very artistic, full of historical moments.We managed to see a monk drawing something on a long cloth..There were lots of arts and crafts selling.. we managed to make our own ""chop stamp"".."
Nice to browse,The best place is Ssamzie-gil where traditional art is reinterpreted in the modern way. It's nice to browse around. Go to the side streets for the restaurants. There are cosmetic and tea/coffee shops but not as crazy as Myeongdong.
A peaceful backlanes...,"Unique architecture and Hanok houses filled up this section of the Seoul, although it is now a tourist hotspot, Insadong hasn't loss any of its aura from that ancient period. Adjoining the UNESCO listed Cheongeok Gong, I wonders who resides here during the early Joseon era."
A great place for a wander,"If you like small shops featuring local art and local historical style restaurants this is a great spot for a wander. Quite a contrast to the modern mega shopping areas of Seoul, which are impressive in size and variety too, but this is where you go for local and historical items and personal service. "
Love this place,"I came back to visit this place twice. On Sundays they close the streets to traffic so it's only pedestrians and it can be really crowded, but despite the crowd, the vibe is energetic and youthful, you see families enjoying street foods and looking at different stalls. You can try to use your charm to haggle but not hardcore haggling. I was teasing the lady seling keychains and asking for discounts and she was happy to tell me no discounts, but she did let me choose a smaller keychain as a gift. Ssamzie-gil is like a smaller mall with ramps and if you are into the handmade, artsy souvenirs, then you have to come here. At the very top is a small booth where you can wear pretty traditional hanbok dresses and have your picture taken. It's actually a photobooth. The costumes are free but you go into the photobooth and do your poses and after that you can put colorful cartoony things on your photo with the photobooth machine. Cost around $7 and more if there is more than 1 person. But this is my favorite souvenir from Korea. I also got a hanbok for my daughter as she wanted to be a Korean doll for Halloween. Also a great souvenir or gift will be the stamps that a lot of Koreans still use. You can have your name in Hangul etched on the stamp you choose and will probably take 10-15 minutes. Prices range from $25-50 depending on how big the stamp or how complicated the stamp is. Of course there are the bears in traditional hanbok as keychains, cellphone trinkets and magnets. You can get a map of Insadong at the information booth near Anguk subway station exit. Don't be afraid to try the street food, usually I go with the one with long lines like the old lady with the deep fried honey pancakes, $1.00 fishcakes on sticks, octopus with anchovy flakes and mayonnaise...try it once and if street food is not your thing, there are a lot of small tea shopes, bulgogi house tucked in a few alleys. Rule of thumb, if the place is crowded, the food is probably good."
Old Seoul,"Such a nice area, I came back many evenings to stroll and dine. Lots of restaurants to choose from, gorgeous tea houses in traditional style and plenty of places to have a few quiet drinks overlooking the street. Nice little shops along the way, most a little different to what you will find in the Hypermalls. Only a short walk to the Royal Palace."
The difference,"Different atmosphere!!! The street is best for a walk at night. as not many people during the weekdays. The street filled with shops, souvenirs, street vendors, restaurants and tourists. Have a look around when in Seoul. Myeongdong and Insadong is walking distance away."
Good place to get souvenirs,The souvenirs on sale here were beautiful & reasonably priced too. Nice place to hang out for a short time
"See antique, taste tradition, feel modern of Korea","To wander back street of Insadong, taste of Korean foods is great. If you are affordable, you can buy small gifts at one of hundeds shops. I hope you are enough strong to cross the road of north of Insadong getting into Samseongdong area. New world with good balancing old and new wher most young Korean are crazy about."
Shopping and Eating!,"Great fun! Really touristy of course! But one of the few places you can hit every possible hand craft shopping and lots of food options. We ducked back into several tiny Bulgogi shops as well as some Nice tea Shops (look for the one that has a Tea Museum in it, probably my favorite - its down a little alley way near the ""recycle Center""). Tons to do, see and buy. Schedule 4-5 hours here if you really want to enjoy the arts and crafts. Also there are hands on opportunities in the basement of the big ""mall"" building artist co op!"
A little too touristy,"Insadong is about 750 metres long and filled with shops, souvenirs, street vendors, restaurants and tourists. Nothing too remarkable about the place but worth spending an hour or two strolling about, shopping and having lunch or dinner in one of the many very good traditional Korean restaurants. The best part is to wander off into the alleys which are more attractive and have a number of tea rooms and restaurants. The interesting Jogyesa temple is a 5 minute brisk walk away and a ten minute walk gets you to the Bukchon Hanok village."
Wonderful Tea Houses,"To get to Insadong Street,take train to Anguk station exit 6 and walk ahead 50 metres.Great relaxing atmosphere with pottery,clothing,souvenirs and wonderful tea shops with traditional korean tea.Also ate some delicious dumplings and green tea rice cakes with warm syrup!"
Totally different atmosphere,"If you want to get away from all the high rise buildings and streets crowded with traffic, Insadong is a good place to go. Very friendly atmosphere, nice galleries, small shop and such. Worth a stroll, especially when the weather is nice. Can be crowded though, keep that in mind."
Lovely Place,"Insadong is 1 of my favourite spots in Seoul, its very easy to walk around, plenty of sightseeing stuff & do not give Ssamziegil a miss, u will love it."
interesting area to visit - must go list,love the street stalls that ply the street- many handmade crafts and traditional stuff . We love to go into Paris Croissant for a coffee break as well as for our breakfast 
My fav place to just relax and having coffee,"Insadong is a weekend walking street full of culture and arts. Nice food, nice coffee places, nice souvenir stores, and interesting people. "
A lot of touristy shops for local items,Rather touristy and pricey items for sale here. Though still a good place to take a stroll for a visit. Samssiegil has a range of eclectic shops for those keen to obtain unique items. 
Nice place to browse a traditional Korean culture,"Insadong is located near the city hall, and easy to get there by subway.You will see stores selling souvenirs of Korean traditional style, and there are many restaurants serving the traditional foods and drinks including some street foods(some are not traditional ones, but just popular maybe to the tourists, I guess).At the same time, you can take a rest while enjoying some paintings at the galleries there.Gana Art Gallery is one of the most remarkable place, in my opinion."
Good souvenir shopping!,"This is a good place to buy souvenirs and Korean items. It is a friendly atmosphere and variety of shops from those selling souvenir trinkets to specialty shops such as for tea, art, antiques, and pottery. We have purchased a variety of items from here. There is lots of food options to include street food, restaurants, and unique things like ice cream in ""J"" shaped cones. It is also fairly close to palaces, Tagpul park, and Bukchon village. We get off at Anguk subway station."
Authentic place in Seoul,"I visited Insadong several times during my stay in Seoul cause I lived in the hotel which was close to this street! I can say that it is a place where you can feel the Korean atmosphere. There are a lot of cute shops with the traditional Korean souvenirs, a lot of small restaurants with the national cuisine where you can taste very delicious food and a lot of other different nice places to visit. Besides that you can also watch some street performances and meet some awesome people in there! I think this place is worth visiting by people who are in Seoul!"
"Place for street food ,souvenir",Please try the big J shape biscuit with ice cream. U can get ur souvenir from here. 2-3hrs to spend here is enough. Advice to check the expiry date of product if you buying cosmetic/skin care product.
Truly the heart and soul of south korea,"As to what the bus info said it is what it is, it is a great place to walk around in day or night, also os shopping, hand made crafts to fashion and also subway stations it really describes what south korea is about."
Souvenirs and Street Food,"We thought the place was a bit of a cliche but we still bought most of our souvenirs here. Its a long alley of trinkets, restaurants, art shops etc. Everyone should go at least once."
Worth the visit,"Geared toward tourists, but worth a visit nonetheless. Easy walk through the streets with all manner of souvenir shops, some junky others with quality Korean made merchandise. Definitely worth the visit if you are in Seoul. "
"Touristy, but still a good visit","As it was near the Lotte Hotel, I decided to walk there. It's rather touristy, with tons of souvenir shops (unfortunately items are mostly made in China), but still a good visit. It is eclectic in feel, with its various cafes and art galleries, as well as shops selling Korean bells, plates and bowls. There is also a myriad of tea shops here. Do check out the fried donut shop (1000 won each), as well as the ice cream. If you have time, take a walk further east past the Seoul Art Cinema, where you will find a neighbourhood filled with locals, as well as a row of interesting small family-run restaurants selling blood sausages, lamb and beef, with the cooks outside the shops cutting up the meats. If you head south, across the road behind KFC, Krispy Cream and Burgher King, there are several lanes of small bars and Korean eateries where you can find staples like Bibimbap, grilled Calbi beef and fried eels. The only public bathroom I saw was near the start of the street, opposite Tapgol Park and near the Skinfood store."
Artsy side of Seoul,"This is a little less crowded than Myeongdong. The street showcases Korean traditional culture. Lots of antiques, tea houses, craft shops etc. Take Line 3 get of at Anguk Station Exit 6."
Great street food and trinkets shopping,"Artsy, but so much more on this street! Best dumplings freshly made at this place midway up the street on the left in an alley. At lunch time, can be easily identified by the long line-up of patrons! Try the dumpings combo, and the fried dumplings. So many unique foods/desserts to try. People walking with unique shaped long cones of ice-cream. Worth a visit or two."
Very cute artsy area,We visited Insadong twice during our 5 day stay in Seoul. We loved the look and feel of the area and enjoyed the restaurants and shops. If you are a fan of teas I would highly recommend visiting this area. The countless tea cafes and tea shops are very lovely. If you are traveling with a small child I recommend carrying them or having them walk rather than using a stroller/pram. A lot of restaurants require walking up a set of stairs. Also the crowds would have made it difficult to push around our 7 month old daughter in her stroller but we fortunately had our baby carrier. There are also a lot of English speaking tourist information reps that helped to point us in the right direction.
Souvenir Shopping,This place is near Gyeongbukgong palace and Hanok village. You may visit since this is very near the other tourist attractions. There are a lot of tourists around the area also. There are also a lot of artsy stuff for sale if you are into that kind of things. There are also street food on every corner for you to try.
Interesting,"Lively outdoor area for souvenir shopping. We walked through it during a day of walking from the temples ending up at Lotte department store. Overall the shopping in Insadong does not offer much more than you find in similar Chinese markets. With prices for medium range brand clothing in the department stores being high in Seoul as well, and tax free options the same, Seoul did not turn out to be a good place for shopping. But food-wise Seoul was great, with lots of tasty options. After eating Korean food often for many years (including in very good restaurants) outside Korea, we found some of the best Korean food we ever had in small inexpensive restaurants in Seoul. "
Traditional Korean culture,"First time for us in Insadong, it's a very uniqe place. A lot of traditional restaurant around here. Cute gift shop. cute small groceries, relaxing place to shop around. very nice."
A great shopping district!,"While there is a fare share of tourist trash trinkets, there are also a few hidden gems of the main drag with true one of a kind arts and crafts."
nice and intersting as always,"good place for a walk and enjoying small galleries.best choice even on a rainy day. Wide range of small shops, jewellery, ceramics."
Culture and souvenir Alley,"Great place to spend few hours easily. About 400m long alley. Lined by shops selling Korean art and artifacts. Also shops selling Korean paper is a must try. Try negotiating the price in all the shops. Worth buying are Korean dolls, magnetic folders, key chains, Korean paper art. Don't miss it."
"Touristy, but fun","Most of the people surrounding you here will be tourists, but it's still an entertaining district. Peek in the shops and have some street food!"
Enjoyable walk along the streets,"We came here for the last 2 hours of our trip before going to the airport.Great atmosphere on a Sunday morning. Some street performances. A lot of tourist souvenir shops (cheaper than Myeung dong). Very relax atmosphere for you to wonder around. Ate some snack food here..yes, the ice cream on the 'tube' cone was quite a highlight..practically every tourist was spotted with one. However only the locals were buying the more traditional snacks. So if you are here do walk into the alleys to try the traditional stuff. Went into a tea shop and had a refreshing time tasting and buying the tea.Will most likely visit again - this time to explore the nooks and alleys. Good place to spend an afternoon."
Ice Cream Cone,"I would like to know who manufactures the ice cream cone so that I can purchase some of them. If anyone know can you please post it on the site It looks fun, interesting and delicious. Thanks"
artsy version of myeung dong,"if you have been to myeung dong first, you will find insadong almost the same. this place offers the same experience of street food and souvenir shopping as myeung dong althought i think the main difference is artistic options you will find in the area. it is a long street with lots of korean souvenir shops, restaurants and cafes. this place is close to bukchon hanok village anyway so if you are already at bukchon, might as well take the stroll all the way to insadong. note though that they are very strict when it comes to cleanliness of the area so if you are caught throwing your trash in the street, you will be fined 100usd. smoking is also not allowed."
Interesting area,"We had fun walking around this area and seeing some interesting shops, had a great authentic meal at one of the many restaurants. "
"Always good Korean fun - food, snacks, sights","Insadong is often referred to as a tourist trap but it always seems to be 95% Korean, so I'm not so sure about that factoid. this is always a good time, walking down the street full of interesting sights, sounds, smells - and plenty of restaurants and coffee shops, etc., etc. It's fun during both day and night, but there's a different vibe at night, especially since they stop traffic and you can walk freely without worrying about cars. the people are extremely friendly, both those selling stuff and those enjoying the area - there's a fun, safe vibe to it. the best restaurants are around the nooks and crannies in between the buildings so have fun taking a left or right and just see where you land. the street level shops are generally for cheap touristy stuff, but the artsy shops at the higher levels have some impressive Korean gems - from clothes to art. you really need to do a couple hours in Insadong if you are touring Seoul, don't miss it. BTW, it's much less taxing than Myeongdong."
Love the hidden side alleys,"Yes, Insadong is full of tourists and shops selling souvenirs, but it is also much more than that. There is a lot of great street food stalls, tons of free art galleries to wander through and if you take a detour off the main street there are a ton of small alleys packed with tea houses, mandu places, tiny restaurants, coffee shops and other hidden gems. There are usually tourist information people hanging around in read coats who have really useful free maps of the area and can even recommend some good places to eat."
Favorite Place in Seoul,"Insadong is my absolute favorite place to go in Seoul no matter the season or weather. It's a great area for artists of all sorts, hole-in-the-wall restaurants, street vendors, and much sought after Korean souvenirs. Be sure to walk the entire length of the area, or you'll miss out on some great shops and eateries. Take the side passages away from the main street, and you'll find some great little shops. They're fun to look through even if you don't want to make any purchases. The scarf stall is a must visit, and you'll find some of the best prices for scarves there. (Look for the swarm of women huddled under the 5,000 won signs, but feel free to go into the shop itself.) If you're still hungry after the vendors' ice cream, hotteok, coconut milk, and honey candies, check out ""Little India"" on the second floor of a building about 3/4 of the way down the main thoroughfare (walking toward Myeongdong). The decor and atmosphere alone is enough to make you stay a while. Finish your trip up by meandering through the vendors selling their handcrafted goods. The incense lady is one of my favorites.I love Insadong because every time I go there's something new to be discovered."
Great Area!,"I really enjoyed wandering around Insadong one evening. There are crowds of people, and there are numerous shops with so many crafts! A really great area, even if you're just window shopping."
"Must see while in Seoul, South Korea","I was looking for a specific painting and directed by my hotel to take the trip to Insadong. Glad I did! The artist was located inside the subway and had just what I wanted. Only here can you find those unique cheap souvenir items without the hassle of other places. If you are in Seoul, take the Metro rail or a cab. Lots of strolling on the narrow alley of bargains and grab a bite while there."
Worth a stroll through,"Many of the shops are overpriced in my opinion, but there are some shops where you can get one of a kind Korean crafts or items at a reasonable price. If you're not into shopping, it's a still worthwhile place to visit for a leisurely stroll to window shop and take in the sights and smells. There's one vendor that makes and sells these amazing fried doughnuts dipped in sugar (flatter and airier than a malassada) and if you see her, buy 5."
Shop and snack,An interesting place with lots of shops and stores selling Korean local snacks and souvenirs/handicraft. Scenic during winter time. Variety of snacks is available. Good art places for kids to participate. A good place to visit for artistic feel.
Worthwhile area to see artistic side of Seoul,"Insadong has become commercialized, but still represents a pleasant neighborhood in Seoul to visit, stroll around in, and people-watch. Pedestrian-only paths are lined with artists' studios, art supply stores, eateries, and handicraft / souvenir stores."
insadong,fun little neighbourhood filled with a lot of vendors selling traditional Korean gear and what not. If thats your thing then go for it! 
Korean souvenirs & delicacies,"If you only have a short visit to seoul, then this place will provide anything you need from korea.. souvenir shops, delicacy sellers(there's one lady on the street claimed she's famous with her rice snacks - a must try!), ginseng teas, art galleries, local korean food (if you don't speak korean, body language is accepted :)"
Excellent. ,Excellent place for tourist to understand S. KOREA. 
A work across the cultural and artistic side of Seoul,"A street full of art galleries Insadong, provides a enthralling snapshot of Korean culture for the tourists... A nice lively shopping area, where can enjoy shopping for souvenirs and other stuff based on local culture and traditions.. I bought some nice handmade toys for my 1 year old daughter and she loved it.. it really gives a nice feeling of being in a place with a culture in middle of beaming fast economic city.. Enjoyed strolling across the street while enjoying some nice Korean tea and ofcourse SOJU.."
A Must See Area of Seoul!,My husband and I lived in Seoul for a year and this was an area we kept coming back to it. It is one of the most historical areas of the city with so many shops and restaurants! If you are looking for authentic Koreans souvenirs this is a must visit! There are always lots of vendors in the street (which is blocked from traffic) so the atmosphere is always changing. Check out the side alleys for hidden gems and explore the whole area!
Wonderful place to eat and shop,Lovely place to walk and people watch. There are some nice stores to buy souvenirs. We found a fantastic place on a side street that sold home made dumplings. Enjoy
Just an average tourist district with souvenir shops,There is nothing special about this place. The shops are mostly selling souvenirs. Nothing more 
Nice.,"Enjoy walking and checkin out the art work at ssamziegil mall, insadong. Saw some snow flakes there too.REmember to try out the ""Poop"" cake located at G floor, it was nice.. :)"
good place to have some tea,You must explore all the nooks and crannies here. There are all kinds of ally ways with different art and tea shops. We found a dumpling place that was great. And as always we walked away with some great art pieces.
Interesting Artsy Place,"My time in Seoul is really short, but Insadong is really my favourite! I spent most of my time here.It's a paradise for people who likes arts. Art works, decorations, exhibitions etc. Things are definitely not cheap, but they're all so pretty!I've got a pair of glasses made in half an hour in Ssamziegil too in a shop called Eye Sonagi. Even with problems communicating properly, I appreciate how much the shop tried and provided good service. If I were to go back to Seoul again, I would will go Insadong."
Insadong or Myeongdong - tough choice,"Great area with a long pedestrian street with some of the best shopping (and street food) in Seoul. It's amazing that Seoul is off the radar for so many people; I've visited 36 countries and this was definitely one of our favorites. Stay in Myeongdong or Insadong; can't go wrong, as they are quite close to each other - easy to walk."
the Korean town in Korea,"My friends and i visited this place last 2010, stayed in the nearby hotel Sunbee, shopped for all the souvenirs we can get, ate at the traditional restaurants and western restaurants as well and so Im so impressed with this place thus, when I came back , I brought along my parents, 76 and 71 years old. We stayed in Somerset Place which is just a stone's throw away from Insadong, we used Insadong as our reference place everytime we have to go somewhere, like when we needed to go to Nami Island, there was a shoo in insadong where you can buy the tickets, bus tickets and the entrance to Nami Island, the shop is called Nami Island Culture and Tour Information, the sign says 3F meaning its on the 3rd floor of the building, there'sa shop downstairs that you will mistaken for the Nami info place but its not however the lady boss of the shop was very nice to give you the direction, there's a staircase and a lift whichever you prefer and you will alight in a coffee shop and you' ll see the office for Nami Island!the receptionist was very accomodating and she'll give you a map and tell you to wait for the bus whenever your schedule says so, which is usually at the the Pagoda Park or Tapgol park, the fee was around USD30 , includes roundtrip bus trio, ferry and entrance fee. We also make used of the Korean tourism information there in Insadong o asked how to go to Bukchon Hanok Village, they have English speaking volunteers, they have 2 stations one near the entrance to insadong street and the other nearbthe Pagoda Park. the street also have the camera pole where it will take your pictures like CCTV camera then younhave the option to send it via email to your friends, and also interactive map where you are and how to go from where you are and of course if you still cant underrstand it the volunteers intheir info kiosk can very well help you, theyll gife you maps, drwa on the map,give you the addresses , tell you where to take the bus or train, give you all the infos you need for free!The Insadong streets has all the korean street foods , they have western and restaurants, even there's some restos that dont have english translations they have photos and most of the restos when you go in ,one or two of their satss at least can understand english and will trytheir best to accomodate you and your needs.Souvenirs you need? they have everything and the shop owners are very kind too, you buy some and they throw something for free!!They also have all the Korean beauty products, like the masks, the BB creams its all there and a lot to choose from!Its safe also, last time when i was there with my friends, we went back to our hotel past midnight as we explore the rest of Jongno,the King Sejong and General Yin Su Shin shrine.We also visited the house of Doksu and House of Min, the Tapgol Park where the pagoda was enshrined. there's a mall like building the Samshieggil its houses a lot of trinkets, souvenirs, foods etcWe also saw a filming of one of the korean drama, the guy was familiar he was in Coffee Prince drama he was the"" waffle guy"" there! he was handsome but the staffs were strict!We enjoyed insadong!"
Nice street,"Insadong is a very touristy street. It is nice to visit a couple of times, but I wouldn't say it's a must must for every time you're in Seoul. There are many souvenir shops and traditional food vendors, so if you want a good introduction to korean culture, it's a nice place to start. Especially with the traditional sweets :3. I bought some paper, ink and brushes at some stores in insadong. The stores can often be expensive so if you're going to buy anything I'd suggest trying not to jump too fast at the first thing you see, many shops have the same items for sometimes different prices. There are also some good korean restaurants in the area ;) Enjoy!"
Not worth the bother unless you have plenty of time,"My husband (admittedly not a shopper) and I roamed this crowded street for all of about 35 minutes so you know we didn't get too far. It was a Friday but it was jammed particularly with young gals looking for typical tourist souvenirs - there are many such shops but all too crowded to enter or to move around it. We did happen into a lovely jewelry shop/ studio and also into a very upscale local clothing designer's small shop. We made it down a couple of the quaint alleyways but found nothing more of interest and my husband was not amused. We spotted a number of welcoming tea/coffee shops but we had recently eaten and were not anxious to stop for a cup so we departed. I, the shopped, was not disappointed to depart; had I been alone I would have wandered another hour or so just so I would have felt my initial impressions were valid."
Clean and Cool,"I love this street..it's clean, not too crowded. the atmosphere is very good. there are many small shop that sell unique soveniers and there are many small korean restaurant that really good. i visit insadong 3 times when i visitted seoul. There's also a buliding like a mall that really unique for me. you can go up without using stair.You can found tourist information in insadong. just ask them anything ^^"
A must visit for me whenever I am in Seoul,"I simply love Insadong. I've been to Insadong 6 times in my 4 visits to Seoul. The only place i would buy traditional souvenirs and handicrafts. I once tried getting traditional souvenirs from other places like Dongdameon, Itaewon, Myeongdong, Gangnam underground shopping area, but Insadong has so many variety and colors for you to choose - from small teddy bear wearing Hanbok keychain to cosmetic pouches to tea set to art pieces. The other places i mentioned here may have one or two types of souvenirs with limited colors - usually same price or slighly higher price than Insadong. At Insadong, do not buy from the first shop you see the item you are interested to buy. Walk around first. Many shops sell similar things. Shops at the main alley seems to sell at standard price. Look for the items at the small alleys. I got cheaper price at these shops. If you need to buy lots of souvenirs for people back home, walk around, mentally think of things you want to buy, and buy from one shop. They will give you better price if you buy a lot. I always enjoy the street performances at Insadong. Stay and watch and immersed yourself in the relax atmosphere. And there is Ssamziegil - a unique shopping building with spiral stairsway. But prices at Ssamziegil are generally more expensive than the main/small alleys."
Oldie but goodie,"When I go this small ally, I feel like I'm in some sort of traditional age. You may feel same way like I do. If it's just oldie looking, I'm not even going there. There's also many goodie for the tourists even for a local citizen like me. You can see the STARBUCKS that written in Korean in there. Starbuks Insadong branch is world first Starbucks that title is written in their local language."
Mostly restaurants,This is an alley with many old tradition houses and these houses are mostly restaurants. Restaurants here are quite costly. We enjoy the walk but went somewhere else for dining.
Interesting place,"It is quite interesting to see so many people in just one street. I also find the shops interesting, selling trinkets, souvenirs, and food. We tried the food sold in the sidewalk. Artists are also found here. "
Interesting place,Visit if you like handicrafts and lots of indie/local Korean fashion/household/craft items. Some pretty interesting alleys and some good restaurants/tea houses housed in traditional hanok houses.
good place for a quick shopping stop-over,"The multi-storey shopping atrium in a side street is probably the best place to visit. Loud with teenagers, you can nevertheless find a lot of cool things to buy, new and old. There is plenty of food around, also."
A lot of the same but some interesting alleys,"Yes many of the stores sell the same stuff, you need to sort out the tourist stuff from the nice stores. Also there are some decent restaurants in the alleys in the area.We visited the Insa-dong Chatjip (인사동 찻집) for some tea to take a break from the shopping. Highly recommend stopping in to a tea house for a break."
Way too touristy,It was neat to walk through. There were neat socks (there are neat socks every 20 meters in Seoul). Good to see but the majority of your time is better spent elsewhere.
Good shopping place,"I have been to this place sereval times and i love going back to dis place.Mostly its shopping place for the foreigners so you should haggle before buying anything.You will get all kinds of traditional items, souvenirs , handmade things as well as paintings.Subway is the best option to go there, Jonggak Station (Exit 3), Anguk Station (Exit 5)"
"Antique hunters place, but seems over priced","Did not really like Insadong as most shops just sold the same things and choice of souvenirs were fairly limited. Antique shopping was over-priced and not much value unless you appreciate Korean art. Foreigners might find it hard to properly value the pots and ceramics....and hard to ascertain the authenticity of the antiques. Best part of Insadong was a big funky complex with modern art and lots of cartoon spray paintings/graffiti. Go there for the street food - which they have plenty of! A lot of shops sell the same items, but worth trying bits and pieces with each shop as they seem to have their own twist to the same items. "
Nice atmosphere,"art crafts, arts gallery etc etc everything about art is here. Nice atmosphere. Do check it out when you are in Seoul"
market everyday,"Are you KPOP LOVERS ?They have KPOP STORESBut the very recommended one is, i'll give you the directionStarts from the outside of mall Mesa, just go straight to the market, until you see the 2 branches street, take the right one, the just go straight, pass the face shop and go straight, you can see the store on your left side, right infront of missha store"
my favourite place because i like art,"i have been back to insadong several times i always enjoy going to galleries there , amazing art i bought lots of souvenirs , some cheaper than others i loved seeing all the handmade things i got my portrait drawn by an artist there , fantastic picture ^^ there are art workshops you can do , you can make stuff from all sorts of materials... there are cafes there and there are always people there from charities too and someone is playing music on the street , so you can listen to that , guitar or their tiny keyboard or violin it makes me feel inspired ^^ i went to an indian restaurant there , which was really terrible but evereything else, i like"
Excellent Shopping,The hundreds of booths with variety of goods makes this the best shopping area we saw. The vast majority of craft is made in Korea and is very reasonably priced. Many vendors will also negotiate the price. It is a treasure trove of culture.
My favorite part of Seoul,"Perfect for shopping, eating, browsing - very cute area. Eat the soft serve ice cream you can find, go to Osulloc for some Green Tea tiramisu and ice cream (both of them oustanding), and get gifts. In particular Korean pottery, hand made paper and silk scarfs and pouches. Such a pleasant neighborhood."
Average,"Nice to see if you can catch it on a quiet day, but generally the shops are expensive and aimed at selling at opportunist prices to the bus loads of tourists charging through. "
Has its ups and downs,"It's a nice area to peruse, but it's definitely aimed at tourists (lines of tourist buses are parked and ready to unload Japanese and Chinese groups at all times). Towards the end of the main street there is a great little craft mall that spirals up 3 or 4 floors. Inside you will find slightly more expensive, but much more unique and interesting items for sale. It's all very artistic and the street food available in this area is decent as well. Still, there are better neighbourhoods to visit if you want a more 'local' experience."
Shopping Hub,"The whole place is lively and bustling with crowds that are either admiring the whole place or are scouting for that perfect souvenir or a good eating joint around the place. Like any shopping areas you come across the place is lively, crowded and even noisy to an extent. The place has a lot of places that sell traditional kabook (Korean robe) and various other handicrafts and on a good bargain skill you could actually go home with some really nice souvenirs but the keen and sharp eye is required and authenticity of each product depends on your sharp eye. The place also offers you an opportunity to get yourself photographed in traditional Korean garments, which is available for rent as well as for sale too."
Antique stores,Many resto and fancy stores! Mostly they sell antique materials and instruments. You can try the dessert white pastry they handmade it! Cafés and lots of small bakery shops! You can visit the tea store famous jejune green tea shop.
Must visit destination,"It has galleries, lots of eating places (mostly Korean with options for Italian, Chinese, Japanese, American fried chicken and cafes), bakeries, calligraphy/craft shops, tea shops, clothes, shoes, handbags, jewellery, etc. Prices are reasonable and shops offer great varieties for tourists. Lots of locals eat there as well. Korean food is fantastic and offers good value for money. Generous portions even for Western standards. Ordered a braised chicken (small size) and it turned out to have a whole chicken. "
"Insadong, Worth Your time, especially if you like artsy craft stuff.","Insadong had a lot of arts and crafts. One great building about the middle of the market that is 6 stories of nothing but small hand made craft items. Of course the prerequisite tourist swag. Shirts, nic-nacs etc. The main attraction is the market is very close to the subway exit. Some of the pricing is better if you venture over to Myeong-dong for similar items though. After walking around I highly recommend the foot massage for 18,000KWon (~$16.50USD) for 30 minutes. There is a rotating foot in the alley about midway. It was wonderful. I really needed it after all the walking around in Seoul. If you want they do have the little fish that eat the dead skin off your feet. I hear it is also great but not for me."
Nice shops and restaurants,"Me and the mrs spent an hour or so here, it's full of nice cultural shops and good for purchasing presents for friends and family. There are also some nice restaurants and street food you can buy, however, you will have a challenge on your hands to find a bin anywhere. When we went we seen an American playing the violin in the middle of Insadong (western tune), honestly, I thought it was just weird considering it's a KOREAN cultural place, but there you go. You can get PSY socks, which are just cool as, wooden masks (though they cost 20,000+, beauitful paintings and tea (there is a special shop, not cheap but very very nice). I would say it would take 2 hours to go through everything if you went through every shop and it's a nice experience...just ignore the idiot playing the violin in the KOREAN cultural place - Train stop is Anguk."
insadong,"insadong was an awesome place to see traditional artworks and craft. however, for a budget/student traveler like me, there is not much to buy or purchase. it would be good to pair up the Insadong visit with the nearby palaces or traditional village to make it more worth the journey.But if you're into traditional craft and antiques and have the $$$ to spend.. Insadong is the place to shop"
Overrated,Insadong is overrated as it does not have many things to offer. The stalls are just selling the same thing and there is not much to explore. 
Experience the Korean culture,"This place is full of tranditional Korean culture, visiting here can experiece the cultrue easily. And if you want to buy some tranditional souvenirs, this is the best choice to visit here."
"very vibrant street, good place to get souvenirs","Like other reviewers said, somewhat touristy. But it has interesting galleries, shops, very vibrant at night. (Don't go in the morning, nothing is open). For a one stop souvenir shopping, it is a great place. Not to mention it is very close to the two palaces, and subway station"
nice market,"i love the small shops offering korean traditional souvenirs. you can find so many nice, cute little things, from fridge magnet to beautiful coasters, pretty dolls in hanbok to figurine. there are also street vendors selling cheaper goods--i found one that sold very cute pens and pencils, only for 1000 won each.also, a lot of street food, which i love so much. walking along the street is very enjoyable, even if you're alone like I was. the atmosphere is lovely.so for me, it's the best shopping area in seoul.not too big and crowd, with great souvenirs."
Great place to feel Korea,"Insadong is the grate historical place where you can feel korean culture through many traditional things, shops, art and handmade. Here you can buy many unique souvenirs with wich you can impress your family and friends home, its especially good when you need to buy presents for your second part, as far as you can do by yourself some handmades such as draw on cap or plate, make some ornaments on food or even make some special rings."
About Insa-dong^^,"One of the Seoul’s most visited places among foreign travelers, Insa-dong is often regarded as a museum in which modern and tradition coexist in a harmonious manner. The district contains historical sites and its roads and alleys are lined with traditional tea houses, restaurants, calligraphy shops, antique shops, art galleries and craft workshops. Its main road turns into a pedestrian zone every Saturday afternoon and Sunday, offering a venue for exciting street performances including traditional folk performances."
On Average,"If you're looking for Korean ceramics or pottery stuff, Insadong is appropriate place to come. Otherwise if you're looking for some souvenirs with cheap price, there is another place which is cheaper."
"Artsy... but at the same time, tourisy","Filled with1. souvenir shops2. arts and crafts3. small cafes and street snacksBe willing to haggle and if the price is not right, move on and compare."
Best place for souvenirs shopping,"Easily accessible via subway with great bargains and variety of souvenirs, art works, etc. Prices are comparatively cheaper here, too."
Touristy shopping area ...,"The must-do for first time tourists in Seoul, I guess. I enjoyed walking along the street, looking at what was on offer, and soaking in the buzz and crowd. But, at the end of the day, not much different from other shopping areas in Seoul."
Great place for souvenirs,"This is such a nice blend of current and old mixed together. Great location for tourists to buy all the souvenirs and enjoy some great treats! There are art galleries along the way and tons of shops for gifts. Treats range from sweet to savory and you will end up buying something, why fight it! We enjoyed this shopping experience very much - bought lots of little giveaways for friends, coworkers and family. Highlight was the ""almond treats"" wrapped in silk honey. "
Huge crowd...,"This could have been a quaint little village with artsy shops and nice restaurants in traditional set up....if not for the crowd! I was unfortunately there on a weekend. The crowd starts from the traffic junction where you see so many people trying to cross over to Insadong. The wierd thing is, the place was not fancy or brightly lit and with so many people walking around, it was somewhat uncomfortable and I cannot wait to get out of the place!"
Traditional shopping,"This is the perfect place to pick up some souvenirs/traditional gifts for your friends and loved ones. And enjoy some tasty snacks while you are at it. This is a walking street surrounded by shops. In the nearby alleys there are a number of Buddhist institutions. If you want a good traditional meal, try the Barugongyang restaurant within the Temple stay building in front of jogyesa temple."
Short of expectations...,"Place is nice, little alleys and small shops which are cute but items over priced compared to other areas. Good to experience it maybe once if it is your first time.Found the food here over priced and not as good as other areas in SeoulThere is a Starbucks located here where the signage is in KoreanIf you are short of time, possible to skip visiting here"
Great place for local eating & traditional souvenir!,"I've been to Insadong many times. It is always lively, with great entertainment along the streets. Insadong is great for trying traditional foods of Korea and buying traditional souvenir known to Korea. This place is a must if one is visiting Korea. You can get a real feel of the culture here!"
Great for shopping/eating,This area has a lot of antiques and souvenirs. It's packed with vendors selling food and has many places to get authentic Korean tea. It hosts many attractions nearby as well. It's not far from Dongjak Station and others.
A traditional area - perfect for souvenirs and some temple time!,"This is a very sweet street filled with all kinds of souvenir shops. You can find everything from traditional carved wooden folk masks, to personalized wax stamps, fans, duramagi (grey monk robes), etc. It's also just by the Jogyesa Temple which is a beautiful must-see! "
souvenirs/food/art,"nothing much here, there are quite a number of stall selling souvenirs and its abit pricey. but what worth to buy in korea i think probably their stainless steel utensils?"
nice area,Street vendors selling everything and different types of food and drink for sale in this nice area of Seoul. There are also many tea houses. Fun to visit. Dont forget to buy the Taffy TTeokduk
Where are the tourists head,It's a good place to buy souvenirs as well as enjoy some good tea at one of the numerous tea houses in the area. There are good restaurants for authentic Korean food as well as Buddhist vegetarian eats as well. It's perfectly located near Gyeongbukgung and Gwanghwamun so it's easy to enjoy a lunch here between visiting other landmarks in the area.
Cute artsy area,"Great place to walk around, enjoy a tea, visit art galleries, and take it all in. Shop keepers and artists were all very friendly. If looking to take home a souvenir, make sure it is certified as made in Korea. Lots of cute restaurants."
Great place to have a cup of Korean tea and sweets,"Insadong has a lot of tea cafes. Definitely would recommend trying a cup of Korean tea such as cinnamon/ persimmon. Korean sweets called ttuk are also interesting. It can get touristy with souvenir shops lining both sides of the streets. However, I was very impressed to see volunteer guides standing on the corners of the streets to give guidance to visitors. Not a bad place to spend an afternoon."
lots of tourists traps,"Everybody says it's a must go when you're travelling in Seoul, I tend to disagree. Ok you will see a lot of traditional souvenirs and it might look interesting but most of them are ""traditional"" stuff made in China... It can easilly getting quite expensive as well. Prefer traditional markets (Gwangjang or Dongdaemun for exemple). Although Insadong might be more English-friendly..."
I live in iI sarong for two years,"Shopping, food, history... It's all here. Outdoor mall. Alleys full of food, sights, shops and attractions."
Best Place for quality stuff,"Insadong is a quaint place, with lots of narrow alleys and streets and is filled with people during weekends. I guess they were there to either eat or shop. The place has some awesome restaurants, tea houses, galleries and shops. We dined at Sanchon a pricey but authentic temple food restaurant. I did quite a bit of shopping too and found the products to be extremely good quality compared to other open markets in Seoul. Insadong is very close to the Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Bukchon Village and so you can do all three of them in half a day. "
Little dissapointed - tought there would be more,I had imagined a bigger street with many different shops and souvenirs but after 3 all looked the same.
We had a great visit.,"We were limited by time, but had a great visit to Insadong. While we were there a traditional band marched down the street. It was a great show, we will revisit Insadong on a day when we have more time."
slower pace of shopping ,over here u can walk into the alley to eat authentic Korea food. and there is a tea shop that brew really nice fruit and flower tea. 
Has an old feel,One of the most touristy areas of Seoul. It was one of two places that had Tourist shops and things to take back home.There is one main street with little roads branching off it where you can find old tea shops etc. It is defo worth going into one of these old tea shops to get a traditional Korean tea.
Heartbeat of Seoul,"Visited one Saturday mid-morning and the place was just bustling. Very touristy, but much of the local culture was on show. The tea houses were great and the street food a ttreat, lots of restaurants to chhose from too. Seem to be quite a long street, so wear comfortable shoes. There was a street parade at the time of my visit and that really got everyone, visitors and locals transfixed for a while.Lots of souvenirs shops, but was dissapointed that not much variety to choose from. The prices weren't that great either. I got better bargains and more variety elsewhere. Good place for costume jewelryJust walking up and down the street though you could feel the pulse of the people. A nice way to spend half a day and catch the real sights and sounds of Seoul."
Love this place!,I really loved shopping for little bits and bobs here. Really col atmosphere and some great art galleries around to! You can buy cute souvenirs here.
My favorite area,"This wasn't only my favorite area because we were staying at the Fraser Suites, but there was so much to see and do. If you're not staying in the area, be sure to take a look"
Cool artsy place to shop,This place is about 4 blocks long full of touristy and artsy shops. There was a multi-floor plaza (Ssamziegil) located right on the main road that we found really interesting - full of unique one-of-a-kind type stores. Lots of souvenir stores as well. Great way to spend an hour or 2.
"Wonderful market with mix of arts, crafts, and resto's.","Ate at the ""Little India"" resto - priced extravagantly, but the ambiance must be experienced. Stop for a chai and snack. Plenty of variety for street food - safe! Plenty of local resto's - Thai, Korean, Japanese, Viet pho etc... Amazing art for sale, lots of manufactured crafts, but treasures can be found. Live music on the weekends. Clean. Central. Must see."
Interesting. Touristy. Locals.,"Full of restaurants, bars and trendy shops. Lots of locals and tourists alike... Busy, especially at weekends. Worth visitng the huge musical centre at the bottom end of Insadong."
Saturdays and Sundays- Best Times to Visit,"On Saturdays, from 2 to 10pm and Sundays, 10am to 10pm, Insadong comes alive. Parts of streets are closed off and there are vendors everywhere. The street food is excellent. The shops are a mixture of artistry, high fashion and unusual, creative items. Anguk Station (Line 3 Exit 6). There are two seperate sections that come alive, but it is hard to describe to ask for directions once you get there."
Artsy place for souvenirs,"Went here with my parents and 2 teenage sisters, and the loved it. We shopped for little souvenirs and streetfood. My mom bought some houseware and skincare products. Check out Ssamziegil, which is a three or four floor building filled with nice little shops selling home decor, clothing and accessories. It wasn't too crowded when we went, and the atmosphere was pleasant. "
An Excellent place for cultural shopping,"Insadong is a really long street full of quirky little shops, mainly selling the more traditional items. It has the occasional cosmetic shop (the majority of which can be found in the Myeong Dong area) but in Insadong you can find things like jewellry, tea houses, street food etc. It is slightly over-priced, as a main tourist area, so be prepared. "
Good stuff!,"I just loved the shops here - ceramics, hand painted wall hangings, small ceramic pendants, colorful fans - it is a bit difficult to pull oneself away from here. Prices are fixed and reasonable. The only discount is if you would pay by cash instead of by card.There are a couple of National Souvenir Shops, which seem to be certified, and where I found some Celadon of very good value.With plenty of Tea rooms and some street food, this is good fun for at least half a day. I ended up going around the shops in the street 3 times."
Built for tourists,"Is a great location to wander if you realize it's focus is the tourist in South Korea.Plenty of shopping and collectibles you can find, plenty of foreigners and plenty of happy local merchants waiting for your business. "
A More Artsy Vibe Than Myeongdong,"While Myeongdong is all about hustle and bustle, In Insadong, you will find a more artsy vibe with various galleries, exhibits, and stores selling local crafts and wares. I also remember there were a number of places selling K-pop souvenirs. Supposedly, there are numerous restaurants in the area where you can get an American style breakfast (although I didn't get a chance to look for them). I did eat at ""BlackSmith"" (a local chain specializing in Italian food that's usually in K-dramas) and it wasn't bad but wasn't great either. I only wanted to try it because I have seen it in numerous K-dramas."
cultural,Insadong is a touristy but very cultural place. This was where we got to try wearing the hanbok for free (at the Tourist Information Center) and where we got to taste the BEST MANDU in the city!!!
Delightful Little Tourist Trap,"Upon arrival to Seoul, I acclimated and practiced my very limited Korean in this little shopping/eating area. People were friendly and helpful, particularly when I attempted to speak Korean.Check out the little vegetarian place, Ohsegayhyang Restaurant. I would give it a 5-star review for vegan/vegetarian places to eat authentic Korean, but cannot seem to find it on TripAdvisor.Also, look for a mask shop where the owner carves the masks while you watch. That is a treat you won't see many places ... I didn't even see it at Andong where I went for the traditional mask dance.Oh, don't forget to stop in at Miss Lee's, on the end of Insadong towards the palace! "
City of souvenirs or souvenir's land,"So mane thing to look and buy! Of course a lot of restaurants as well!The choice is huge. And the prices are very good (you can ask for discount everywhere).If you need TaxFree (money refund), you can do it right there! So comfortable for tourist!Also many nice things to see!"
Eating in Insadong,"Insadong, like manyothere Korean provinces have great food. Many of the side streets have restaurants that the locals frequent, the prices seem a little lower. If you love Korean foodcheck out where the locals go to eat"
A Place for Souvenir,"If you are looking for comparatively better quality souvenir, Insadong is the place in Seoul. There are also little surprises such as some street performers at separate location of the street. "
"Touristy, but in a good way!","Insadong is a great place to find souvenirs, especially for people who can't stand Itaewon. There's an antiques street, lots of street food and performers, and a place to get fresh dragon's beard candy! A great place to spend an afternoon, especially after visiting Changdeokgung palace."
Long street with cultural stuff + souvenirs,Insadong street is a relatively long street with lots of cultural stuff and also a place to buy your Korean souvenirs. There are also many eateries and street food there. Buskers also come out at night to serenade the passer-bys.Insadong is near Changdeokgung Palace and Bukchon. You can go to these three places together.
Place to look for interesting items,"Insadong is a interesting place with local culture handicrafts, collectible, art and food. this place is always clouded event in the week days. we were there during week days and the place is full of people, not only tourist but local as well. there are also a lot of students having survey programs. its a great place to visit.you can find the famous corn ice cream at this place. the shop is a corner shop. you can't miss it coz you'll see a long queue till the road side. :)along the road is also alot of local tea and desert shop. you must stop and try it."
Quite interesting for foreigners,"So many small interesting things and Korean food. Street is not long, but crowded with Koreans and foreigners. "
Interesting shopping & dining experience,"Insadon has a lof of interesting handicrafts, collectables, art galleries and home-cooked Korean food served in their traditional hut-like houses. I would strongly recommend this place for the more mature people above 40s who appreciate such nostalgic and non-pressurising stroll down the lanes."
Good place for Souvenir shopping,"You will find the common souvenirs here, like shirts, pens, stuff toys, key chains and a lot more. Shop owners speak english and japanese."
Antiques and souvenirs,"Just be prepared for pushy salespeople. The area is gorgeous, the streets are very pedestrian friendly, and there's lots to see."
Insadong Arts Area,"I've lived in Seoul for nearly a year now and this is still one of my favorite areas of town. There are many art galleries to meander through as well as many shops with original artwork done by local artists. If I am purchasing something other than an original piece of art, I always ask the merchant to verify the country of origin for the item. Some of the shops here will specify that they only offer things which are made in Korea. It is important to ask if your intentions are to buy authentic Korean, even with the souvenirs offered. You will find many good places to eat up and down the alleyways. There is also a tea museum and many other interesting spots to visit if you get off of the beaten path and explore a bit. And just one street over from the main one, there is a Buddhist Temple, a Templestay Information Center with a nice gift shop and a fabulous vegetarian restaurant on the 5th floor where the food is prepared by the monks. There are plenty of shops up and down this street selling prayer beads, Buddhist clothing, Buddhas, incense, etc. It's well worth the stroll! Enjoy! :-)"
Qiete shopping district.,"Compare to Myeongdong, Insadong is not as crowded but there are some unique traditional itmes you can buy. Also many eateries you can try. The foods are very cheap; between $6 to $10, you can have hearty meals."
"Souvenirs, and more souvenirs!","If you are a fan of authentic artworks and souvenirs, I suggest you go to Insadong if you're in Seoul. Of course to enjoy the place fully, you have to be there early. Because with so much to see and lots to buy, you'll need hours of walking around to finish everything. Besides, there are plenty of people all over the place. As you walk, you'll find alleys filled with shops selling all kinds of artistry from ceramics, to wood, to paper, to steel and at prices reasonable enough to make you buy more. There are also antique shops and galleries worth visiting. So, bring enough money to get you by.And people are oh so helpful. When I ran out of Korean Won, I looked for a money changer and there's this one police aide who guided me all the way to the place where the money changer is located. Walk was quite lengthy but it was worth it because the exchange rate was even better than what we have in Hongdae.And if you get hungry there are traditional restaurants, tea houses and cafes to choose from. We had a good lunch in a slightly hidden restaurant. Food was served hot, on time and really tasted so good. Serving was big and the price was reasonable. There are also musically inclined people playing instruments or simply singing in the street. Some are giving money while the rest are just watching. 'Twas fun and entertaining.From here, you can also visit Bukchon Hanok Village. It's a long walk but you'll get there."
Souvenir Street Shop,"Place to be if you're looking for souvenir items, such as tshirts, key chains, posters, etc.There's a lot to choose from and this will be the best place to find cheap souvenir items compared to souvenir items you'll find in malls and duty free shops.The place is neat with lots of cool street arts and designs.Bargain item prices: Found that the lowest items i bought has the following ranges:Korea Tshirts - 5KRWMagnets - 2-3KRWScarfs - 3-10KRWWe had trouble finding the Money Exchange Stalls, as other locals point us to the local banks (which charges commission rates), but eventually found them inside souvenir stores, so better keep your eyes open."
Tourist trap but interesting,It is classical tourist trap far east style with many chinese knock off's. But on the other hand you can find authentic Korean artifacts and souveniers if you dig enough. Don't buy the fiest item you like keep on asking for lower price in the next shop! there is some real fine art galleries and tea shops if you have longer time...
beautiful place,It is very nice place to dine in .... shopping. ... food.... art and craft...etc... it is very pack during peak periods. ...
Good for shopping and eating,"Insadong is really a touristy place, but it's worth visiting for the nice little shops and the good restaurants. There are nice galleries and the names of the shops or the eateries are all in korean letters, so it looks more authentic. So if you want to know how ""Starbucks"" is written in korean... :-))"
Tourist place,"Insadong, is a tourist area, selling tourist stuff. There are plenty of restaurants that offer different korean food. Prices are a little steep, but if you don't like to go around and look for a place to eat. Just go to Insadong, and there are lots of coffee place, dessert place and reataurants."
A Korean spin on street markets,"Street markets, as found in most of southeast Asia, are exceedingly difficult to find in Korea. I think it is a sense of propriety and respectability that prevents their development. That or that virtually everything industrious is owned or controlled by the Chaebol. This is the substitute for the common place elsewhere. You will find food, beverage and nicknacks galore. This is the easiest place to buy the uniquely Korean trinket you didn't even know you were looking for. It is friendly, clean and the prices are suitable for most budgets. There is little pressure for purchase and you won't get much haggling here. It is respectable and the shop keeper is glad to have you and respects you as you browse and purchase or leave.I come here regularly just as a place that is well positioned by palaces, embassy row, museums, and other attractions."
Street of arts and gift,"If you want to bring back the gifts, this is the place..the price and quality is good..quite a number of good cafe to quench your thirst and to rest your feet after strolling along the road..personally , my favourate place to go.."
Brillant for shopping,"We stayed at Angouk just around the corner, so walked here some evenings. The shops are great for high quality gifts. We loved the pottery and the individual craft shops. We also ate in the restaurants that offer really great food at reasonable prices. I would def stay in this area again. "
Go if you love crowds.,"I don't really see the attraction to this area. Could be great for people watching, but that's about it. Tacky souvenirs and same old street food. Nothing special if you have been anywhere in Asia. "
Discreet small lane with many wonders of gift shops and F & B,"Its a small city by itself. A delicate area with peaceful ambience although occassionally motorcycle and car / lorries passes by at slow pace.The 500 meter area consist of gift items, food (including Korean traditional cakes, delicacy package, apparel, leather and do it yourself [by businesses] item for sale).Clean and nice place to shop. At night it is time to have a nice eating with family and friends (for the local). It even have similar 7-eleven shop and never stop with all walks of life walking in and out."
Good place to check out arts & craft,"Insadong used to be a place to go for traditional craft, but I think most of the shops have now are selling souviners, which is nice too, as the souviners here tend to be of better quality. There is also arts & craft ""mall"" which sells nice handicraft. As with most ""trendy"" places in Seoul, there are also many nice cafes to visit."
Shopping!!,"Cheap stuff with perfect quality u can find in insadong .Traditional things also .. I like it .. u have 2 visit , its worth."
Don't miss this little strip of fun~,"Visited during the thanksgiving holiday and this street/ shopping area was one of the few places open. People watching was very entertaining, a good opportunity to try some new Korean Street foods!"
nice place to hang out,"This is one of my favorite places in Seoul. There are tons of art galleries and supplies on this street. It's a fun little shopping street where you can buy lots of gifts from Korea. Reasonably priced. Also, you can bargain with the shopkeepers here and near lots of dining options. Good way to spend an hour or two."
Uniquely charming!,You can find here local crafts and souvenirs not available in other shopping areas. It is near the bukchon hanok village and samcheongdong. Samcheongdong is a very charming row of shops and cafes very unique to korea. Its like a quaint neighborhood full of treasures ready for tourists like us to devour. Try the snacks students are having.
Cultural Awakening,"Insadong is alive with shops, restaurants and vendors. Neighbouring Palaces provide an experience second to none. The clothing stores are unique, their goods mostly hand made and one of a kind. Amber stones, beautifully set in unique designs are available. Silk, handmade fans and scarves are readily available for sale. Insadong is a vibrant area and must be added to the traveller's list of things to do while in Seoul. "
Interesting Arty area,You will be greeted with a nice street that has art galleries & cafes. Samzegil is further down the road & its a nice little mall with interesting shops. Plenty of photo taking opportunity
Charming ,"Great place to hang out! Korea is very traditional at heart despite all the media hype and here at Insadong tradition meets modern life, which is perfect for tourists. "
Interesting,"The area is full of various smells, sights and sounds. It really has a mix of everything and is a far cry from the Gangham district. It has many shops selling all and sundry tchotchkes, foodstuff and some knock-off items. It is very large and one can really take a good stroll. I did purchase a t-shirt for $5, which is really inexpensive for Seoul. I really recommend wearing flat shoes as my friend had some difficulty navigating some of the laneways."
Try Miss Lee Cafe,"If you are shopping around Insadong you should visit Ms Lee Cafe! Ms Lee Cafe was featured by Sweet Potato Couple from We Got Married. Their special menu will be old school bibimbap at 6000won and is really cool. Very retro and unique, hardly you can find it in any other restaurant.

Good place for souvenir shopping,We enjoyed doing some last minute shopping for souvenirs and gifts in Insadong. It is not nearly as jam-packed as are other Seoul markets. Had a very good traditional Korean meal at a restaurant down one of the side streets. Prices for food and gifts were quite reasonable. Easy to access via the metro.
Tourist capital for korean culture,"Every traveller to Korea must go to Insadong. Beautiful handmade items, korean cultural events, art galleries, cafes. Expect high prices."
"Trendy, great art and cool",Really like this street - have shopped there before and returned on this trip. Lots of great shops and food along the street - even better on the side streets. Some small hotels - not sure if they are good but wow location if you did stay in one. Bargaining is fine here but more like 20% or so off and not 50% off or anything that aggressive. Still good to see some price cuts.
Great street at night for tourists,"Went to Insadong St. on our first night in Seoul & it was a good experience. Plenty of Tourist shops & also plenty of food. There where alot of people about & the whole atmosphere was of fun & relaxation. It is right next door to Tapgol Park & a very short walk from Jongo 3-ga stop on line 1 of the subway.It seemed to be a pedestrian only street at night SO just be a bit careful during the day.If you go to Insadong ST, you have to try the ice cream/waffle combination from a shop there. It has a long ""U"" shaped piece, hollow piece of wafle that is filled with soft serve ice cream. Cool as & a niece treat."
a must see for art enthusiasts,"A street enriched with most essential items for art painting, but has also extended to souvenirs for tourists. Yet it is not overwhelmed by foreign tourists where prices for souvenirs are generally cheaper than other areas like Itawon, Myongdong and Namdaemun Market."
Street of souvenir and art,"It is an almost 2 km long street filled with art galleries and souvenir shops. Definitely to see. You can find amazing posters, prints and artwork in the galleries. Also this street is #1 place to go for souvenirs of Seoul and Korea. "
Good Opean Air Traditional Market,"This is a nice pedestrian only street where you can find almost anything from clothing, food, and souvenirs. The price is affordable though not cheap."
"Hanging out place , one of the best in Seoul","If you love art, hanging out , talking and seeing fashionable people , this is probably the best place. With Wifi all around the place, and tasting delicious Ice Cream :3 I love to be here! They have many artsy shops, it quite expensive, I didn't buy it, I am just happy seeing around and enjoying this place with live music going on. Really nice :) How to get here : Anguk Station exit 6 cheesyapee.tumblr.com/tagged/travel"
Seoul's pedestrian street with a Village like atmosphere,Insadong is a pedestrian street lined with galleries and handicraft shops. There is interesting local street life with Koreans of all ages ambling back and forth. Small side side alleys are lined with Korean restaurants with a variety of local cuisines. It is a charming break from the bustle of the metropolis. 
must visit if you want to feel Korea,"I can feel Korean traditional culture while walking around this area. Has many souvenir shops, cafes, restaurants. I feel it seems quite different from what I saw and thought about Korea through mass media these days. Worth to visit once to feel Korea."
Superb place for Korea souvenir,"The best place to shop for souvenir. There are so many types of authentic Korean item. If Myeondong= Cosmetic , Dongdaemun=Fashion, then Insadong=Traditional street of Korea! Superb place not to be missed"
Not sure where is the hype,"A street with many alleys line with teahouse, restaurant, sourvenir shops, art shops, etc. Probably is not my area of interests hence I rated an average. Also, we visited on a raining day so did not really see much except people hiding from the rain and many umbrellas. "
Experience Traditional Keorean Culture,I enjoyed our experience of wearing an authentic traditional korean Costume then taking a souvenir picture and bringing it back home
Lots to see and do!,"I really enjoyed looking at all the art, crafts, and souvenirs. I bought a few items during my 5 hour transit tour but I feel as if I haven't bought enough and done enough activities like trying on the traditional hanboks with free picture and trying out the popular street foods like hotteok. One fun and surprising thing was hearing a Korean song especially Busker Busker's ""Cherry Blossom Ending"" playing as I walked though one of the narrow streets after finishing my lunch (Bulgogi stew which was so hearty and delicious!) in an alley way restaurant. I will definitely have to go back here and enjoy it without the rush of a short transit tour."
Check it out,"Insandong is a wonderful place to spend meandering among the many shops, eateries and hawker stalls. It has a bit of a carnival atmosphere in the evening. You can buy everything from typical souvenirs to beautiful hand-tailored clothing. Well worth a visit."
Include in your itinerary,"It's well worth finding time in the evening to have a wander around Insadong - an interesting collection of shops selling local products and eating places. Amongst the high rise and neon of central Seoul, you get to experience a different side of the city amongst the narrow streets here."
Good for shopping for Cultural gifts!,Try the ice cream in the curly cookie cone!!!We managed to find a studio where we could have our photo taken in Traditional Korean Costume..... it's a great keepsake!
Too much souvenir junk,This was my fourth trip to Insadong in the last five years. I had anticipated the visit all week and saved an afternoon to wander the stores. I was very disappointed at the increase in plastic souvenir items on vendor carts and in stores. It was hard to focus on what had been the interesting traditional items.
yup just perfect!,"great souvenir shopping and great sightseeing and super duper nice people!here you can see modern people live in ancient scenery..perfect!they are so beautiful too..you must go here if you visiting seoul, just buy souvenir at here. go to the palace first then take a cab to shopping area. i think the taxi is only 4000 or 3000 won only..enjoy!"
good view n good place to buy souvenirs....,"went to buy souvenirs....there are many shops selling souvenirs along the road.....find good bargain shops ...sometimes we can get 10% discount on the items we buy at certain amount.....i spent about won 180 000 to buy long spoons for my friends n relatives, fridge magnets, key chains and many other souvenirs made in korea. you have to walk until the end of the road to see what they have in insadong...pls see the photos and then you can understand why one have to put insadong in his itenerary in seoul......i really enjoyed it....."
Absolute Tradition,"Excellent place to enjoy the tradition. Food might be a little pricey but the area is totally awesome. Also i stayed at Insa Hostel, only 100m away from this lovely street. There is street performance every night and it is not as busy as other area :)"
Take some time to explore Seoul,"Insadong is a upper scale neighborhood of coffee shops, restaurants and merchant shops. If you have some time in the afternoon, just walking through the (mostly) automobile-free streets is a real treat."
FOOD FOOD FOOD,It s a heaven for all my foodies out there. Ranging from restaurants to shopping malls- all Korean style. This is the place to be if you want to see Korea more traditional style
Shopping,good spot for shopping and they all take credit cards. Many restaurants for that quick bite. Prices appear to be fixed but with some haggling they will reduce the price a few Won.
Great Place to Shop for Souvenirs,"Best place to shop for cheap souvenirs and try some local tea.Few things I shall stress here. First, over there you will see almost everyone is holding a very special ice cream, its cone is a long curved yellow tube. It's expensive, but its taste isn't so nice. Different person, different view. So you might think its delicious though.Second, don't hustle in getting your souvenirs. Walk for few more stalls, they are actually selling the same things, but I've found that the stalls nearer to the end of the street, their price is cheaper. Do ask for discount.""Pisayo, gaga juseyo."" It was a useful sentence in Korean Language, taught by my friend, it means ""Expensive, give me some discount please."""
Great place to relax,"I love to walk along Insadong. It has a relax feel and you can find some unique shops selling stuffs made by the owner. There are also many cafes and it's a good way to rest, have a cup of coffe and watch the crowd."
Visit the Arty Area do Seoul,"Looking for that special something to take home? Look no further, this is it. Easy access for all people, Insadong has it all ... antique shops, artist stores beside trendy galleries, cute little cafes and more up market restaurants, this region lives and breathes Korean culture! We fell in love with the very unique pottery, buying some pieces to bring home. And don't forget the eel skin products, wallets, bags, belts all at most reasonable prices. Make sure you go down some of the little back alleys, this is where you'll find some of the more interesting traders. Allow yourself at least half a day, enjoy!"
Great for bauble shopping,"Great for a few hours of tourist shopping and enjoying a tea. Most of the stuff for sale seems to be slightly more expensive than other places around the city, but all available in one spot with great choice."
Favorite in Seoul,"This is the place for enjoying the Korea. The souvenir stores in the main street are for the first time visitors. The small stores, local restaurants, unique coffee shop are for the experienced ones. Insa dong doesn't like dongdaemun or myongdong changes over time. It keeps the same feeling for anyone who wants to come and see the old Korea, the Korea before K-Pop, before cell phones. I visit Korea very often,although I usually stay in Gangnam area (south of Seoul), if have to choose one place to visit in the north part of Seoul, I will choose Insadong."
"Souvenirs, Art Galleries and other finds","The street is filled with souvenir shops (from shirts, magnets, chopsticks, fans, bags, shoes, clothes and a lot more); art galleries, handmade crafts, and cosmetics with known brands like The FaceShop and Etude House are present. Stores practically have standard pricing like the Korea T-shirt is at 5,000 KRW and differences would just be on the artwork, colors available and bulk purchase.Aside from the visitors, street vendors crowd the place. This is a good place to shop for your take home treats. At the end of the street, a stage is provided where they a Korean comedy is showcased every Saturday afternoon.Recommended for those who love to shop and first timers to Seoul."
an experience to behold,"One of the best shopping districts one can find. Its so methodical and all shops are neatly arranged and paved roads make the entire shopping experience fun. There are great bargains on shoes, bags and clothes."
Great Place - Only require one visit,Great to see some local history/arts and crafts. A few local stores/cafes within the community.One visit would be enough
Extremely enjoyable for me at least,"Insadong is like a place trapped in time, you get a whole new feeling and experience once you enter the main street of Insadong. Time and activities seem to slow down just a little for you. There were many people when I went there, but it never dampened or affect my experience there at all. Tons of galleries, shops selling traditional handicrafts, instruments and paintings, tea houses, chic little boutique shops and quaint undiscovered restaurants which fell right into my alley. I love appreciating art and antiques so I really enjoyed my time there, especially when the art galleries there displayed art and held exhibitions free of charge, I practically spent the whole afternoon going in and out of different galleries and admiring the archaic yet enchanting old shophouses lining the main street. Very touristy area, but I still loved it."
Nice area but overrated,Just my opinion here....area is nice but basically one street with shops. Nothing special....if time is limited you won't miss much here by not going.
Touristy - only good for 1st timers,"Unless this is your first visit or if you happen to be in this area en route to eateries or bukchon village. I would not highly recommend this place. If you are a 1st timer to Insadong then it would be very fun to see fun souvenirs, street food/performances, etc. I'll leave you to explore and enjoy this area but I would like to highlight the cons of this area so you can take note of.1. Avoid the tea houses along the main streets of the Insadong areas or in Hanok (traditional houses). The prices are a total rip off! Do spend if you just want a refreshing experience of having a traditional omyja (red date) tea in a hanok.2. Tteok (glutinuous rice cakes), peanut/sesame seed rice cakes, rice crackers, sikhye (traditional rice drink) - they are also more expensive here. Grab them in other local markets like Gwangjang market. Way more delicious and cheaper.3. Local souvenirs - expect to pay 30% more compared to Gwangjang market. Likewise for hanok. However the package is obviously prettier here given the difference in prices. 4. O'sulloc tea - upmarket tea place but you can get similar tea in Lotte Mart/Supermarkets at Hyundai department stores. Is okay to grab a hoddeok (pancakes with sugary cinnamon filling) and walk around to soak in the atmosphere IMHO."
Lots of tourists but still great,"This place was very crowded (on a Saturday afternoon, to be fair) but it was filled with plenty of things to do. I doubt there will ever be enough time to see everything here! Lots of art museums, shops and restaurants plus a ton of street vendors and good street food. Plus, the surrounding city area is clean and very nice to spend time in. I will come here many times in the future!"
Touristy but Good Place to Go,Has a different feel from the streets of myeongdong and likes. Enjoyed the stroll there and just seeing the shops and wares they were selling. 
use to be better .... but still good for eats,"Hubby use to live in Seoul many moons ago and said this use to be a more authentic artists street with more handmade crafts etc. Unfortunately, now days it's become more commercial. However, it's still worth a stroll. There are still a number of interesting shops for art and crafts. Definitely check out the little side lanes off of the main Insadong. Lots of restaurants and cafes as well so a good area to get something to eat. It is close to Gyeongbokgung palace so it would not be hard to take a quick look if you're near by anyway."
High Quality Market,This market has some great little cafes and restaurants so try some tea or shaved ice while you are here. The antique shops on the side streets are really interesting and some of the main souvenir shops are really good...high quality items not necessarily cheap but very good. Busy and crowded but friendly and fun to experience. 
Window to Korean Consumer Lifestyle,"Every city has one of these, touristic (local or international), people walking up and down, shops with similar types of commodities, street food and you get lots of chances to buy souvenirs. Of course, you need to find and dig out the little gems in between. So be patient and take your time, be sure to enter into the little side streets, usually good stuff are in those narrow alleys. "
My favorite place in Seoul,"This is a great area to walk around in. If you go down some of the side alleys you can find anything from a cute cafe to an art gallery. Along the main road, there are also lots of souvenirs and ""antique"" stores. It can be very crowded on the weekends, but even then I always enjoy my time there."
Unique place and full of art shops,"Like: food, atmosphere, art style shops, cheap and unique (not common) things, can spend more than 3 hours thereDislike: none at all"
Great buys!,Fantastic place to purchase all your travel souveniers. The souveniers here are of better quality than other places.
Great area to walk around and do some shopping and eating!,I really enjoyed walking around this area to learn more about the Korean handicrafts and eat some of the local treats (there are vendors along the street that sell different food items). The stores were great to buy gifts and learn more about Korea. I also saw a great Korean cultural show which was fun.
Expected more,"Its supposed to be a cultural place with art gallery. However i find more shops selling souvenirs more than art gallery. The dragon beard candy there is superb though. 2 shops are side by side, the one on the left is more popular and i usually buy from that shop. "
Interesting shops,"Interesting place to walk through to look at all the novelties for sale. Great places to eat, drink coffee and also close to the happiness palace."
Cultural heart of Seoul,"Excellent place to shop for souvenirs, local arts, ceramics. This place is well known for the tea houses which serve tea in a traditional way. Also many restaurants and antique shops in the area. The souvenirs here are a bit more expansive then at the local markets but then again the choice is the widest. There are many artists and performers at the street and its buzzing with culture. As it is well located and reached by foot or the metro it makes it a perfect place to visit any time. Also many of the historic places are around and reachable by foot so always a good idea to start and end sightseeing here.There is an information point at which you can get any advice and local detailed maps."
It is good because I like it!,"Some call this street as Antique Street. I don't know about that, because my main intention coming here only and only to find special souvenir that can't be find elsewhere."
Indie place of Seoul,"Stalls will be set up on Saturdays selling various items. Insadong feels like the indie part of Seoul with a lot of stalls selling traditional korean items, vintage items and various art items. We visited the Insadong Art Centre where some solo art exhibitions were held by local artists. Beautiful place with some traditional houses within some alleys along Insadong. We had lunch at a beautiful traditional looking restaurant, really cheap and really good. I'd recommend this place for anybody looking to get some nice art items or traditional korean stuffs. Also there's a really famous stall that sells really nice dragon beard sweets. YOU GOT TO TRY IT. "
Arts and Crafts Center of Seoul,This is the best place to get your genuine Korean-made handicrafts items and view most of the galleries in the area. There is also this novelty store that sells a different kind of cracker that serves as cone for ice cream. Street goes for hours with not only artsy items but good local-made clothes and street food. Comfy shoes are mandatory.
"Paper, Pottery, Jewelry and handicrafts.","You could spend a couple of hours strolling down this little pedestrian street and browsing for Korean handicrafts. It's a wonderful place to buy hand made jewelry, artwork and pottery and other souvenirs. There is no bargaining here. All the vendors take credit cards. "
Quaint and good art decorations,Had real good Korean ginseng and local dumplings by the street stall. Hunted for it and found it only on the way back to hotel towards train station. 
Crowded but fun,Great for people watching as well as checking out the wide range of merchandise on display. It can get crowded and you will need to do a fair amount of walking. You need to wear comfortable shoes.
Very attractive for foreigners,"The neighborhood is really a fantastic one, especially in the evening. This place is second known among all tourist coming to Seoul. There are a lot of street vendors selling souvenirs, food, and some clothes. After 5 pm a couple of musicians appear there and play different music, or make a show. It's a nice place to stroll around and have some dinner in a traditional Korean restaurant. Love it."
Great Place to see people from all over the World..,"This is a great place to walk around and buy some souvenirs for family and friends and its a great place to do some window shopping and talk and then the best part is to decide what kind of lunch you want to have, there are small unique places off the beaten path and be a little adventurous and wander down some of the small alleys for the best little restaurants.. there is one that i found that was traditional vegetarian cooking only.. was really good even though im not a vegetarian at all i would go there again!! Give it a try and look all around.. there are some great coffee shops here too.. i like to go in the winter time when there are less people.. weekends are packed!!"
Very nice,"This area is more crafts and traditional, a slower pace than the other market areas. I had a great experience at Myung Sin Dang art shop. I had a stamp made there. "
A nice place,"a nice place to pick up souvenirs for ppl back home...pouches, keychains etc...many tea houses here too if u're interested in tea leaves.can visit Gyeongbukgong or the musical instrument mart nearby~~"
A must visit for art and culture lovers,"We thought 2 hours was sufficient to go around Insadong but after 6 hours, we had only covered half of the street. Insadong offers an incredible range of attractions to art and Korean culture lovers with plenty of Colours and shops to indulge in. North of Insadong is the Bukhon area that offers boutique brand clothing with plenty to offer. A must visit to indulge in a day's worth of art and culture "
A shopping paradise for souvenirs,This is a paradise for shopping souvenirs. The entire road is full of shops selling souvenirs and there are certain boutique shop as well. Do bargain if you are paying by cash and in certain shops they allow 10 percent discount. An excellent place to buy things. 
Insadong is a must visit for all foreigners in korea. You can eat drink tea buy souvenirs and many little galleries.,There is a korean temple food all vegetable and tofu with a bit of traditional dance performance for dinner. Various tea shops. All prices are reasonable. Souvenirs. Only traditional items are to be sold in this street. Which means you wont find cosmetics fastfood. You will find many coffeeshops and tea houses. Surprisingly you will find a startbucks. Do find out what is special about this particular coffeeshop! 
Great pedestrian area,"One of my favorite areas in Seoul for the collection of art galleries, tea houses, shopping or just walking. Can be calm and peaceful or really bustling on a weekend. "
The Koreatown of Korea,"Insadong always gives me a feeling of warmth and fuzziness. The layout is simple and not as commercially invasive as compared to Myeongdong. It is comforting to take a stroll down the street of Insadong without being harassed by noisy cosmetic shop girls (a la Myeongdong style). A must-do in Insadong for me is to go to O'sulloc Cafe and spend an hour or two, nursing a cup of hot green tea latte and green tea ice cream and green tea cake. And don't forget to buy back some gorgeous green tea bags and cute mugs from the shop. "
The best street in Seoul,"My top favourite place in Seoul!! The artistic feel along the street, especially the Ssamgiezil. The whole building is lovely. Love to spend an afternoon there."
the best place in Seoul for EVERY kind of food & souvenirs,"you can spend all day in Insadong, a real Korean experience - restaurants, shops, are galleries, etc. This is a great place to feel the Korean vibe! And there are always a lot of tourists around to make you feel at home."
Great Atmosphere,"I lived in Seoul for two years and whenever I had company come to visit, we made a special trip to Insadong. It is great to see all the shops - you can get all souvenirs needed (include the street next to Insadong street). The prices are reasonable but do check out the stores next to each other. The services are good. Lots of really good restaurants. Go earlier in the day as there is a lot less people. The tourists start coming around 10 or 11 and then it can get quite busy. It has a great atmosphere and has a good representation of Korea in the area."
Souvenir shops,"It all looks a bit touristic trap, not original flavour remains. Other closeby areas are much better."
Interesting street,"The street is a delight to walk. Do make sure you explore the side streets branching out from the main street. We found the souvenirs to be expensive and our negotiation skills were not up to the mark. However, the farther along you walk, the cheaper things get.You can reach this by walking from the Gyeongbokgung Palace."
A souvenir street,"Great for shopping for souvenirs and taking a stroll through a ""semi-traditional"" part of town. Sometimes crowded with tourists though."
Insadong,"nice district very safe and pleasant to stroll along the stream. But beware when rain comes side flaps open in walls along stream and shush the run off onto the path below from the road above. Stream overflows and path disappears, so sandals advisable"
Shopping and talking,"We were shopping for awhile, actually I was shopping while my husband followed me and stayed on the street. He was stopped by a young school child and his mother who wanted to use him for the completion of a homework assignment that required him to answer simple questions. Who is your favorite rock star? My husband was wise enough to answer Psy. Encounter was recorded on the moms phone. Very cute. Later we were approached by a group of young adults all of whom were studying English and wanted to practice speaking. That was fun! I've traveled a lot and never had this happen."
Fantastic neighborhood,"I spent a lot of time in Insadong. There are so many shops and cafes, lots of wonder art work and creativity in this neighborhood. Loved it."
Trad artsy place,Good to stroll around and buy souvenirs.Watch weird shaped Ice cream cones(trumpet sized)Good restaurants too around area
Very Traditional Japanese,"From Namdaemun Market, we took the line to Insadong, exiting Anguk I think. It is very traditional and at the same time modern. I found the magnets that I was looking for. Magnets don't seem to be everywhere anymore. Then I also found the stainless steel chopsticks with spoon with heron illustration which means ""longevity."" I also bought the stainless steel rice bowl. Great gift for those who is doing Weight Watchers. It measures the rice you're eating if you're concerned with points. I think it's a nice perfect travel souvenir gift!I also found a traditional Korean apron. It's so beautiful I probably don't want to wear it while cooking since it's made of silk. And it was USD$65!Walking around, there were lots of sugar cane juices, very healthy drink! We had some and it was refreshing especially on a hot summer day. They had cotton candy and the people who were making it seemed to have a good time doing it. They were quite happy. We came on a weekday. If you don't like crowds, come on a weekday. We went back on Saturday afternoon and the place was packed and crowded. Everyone seemed to be there!We also bought some nice modern shirts with lace. Lace seems to be everywhere in Korea. They were wearing lace shirts, lace skirts, even lace SHORTS! It was very cute. Koreans are very fashionable so they can get away with anything they wear.My friend who lived in Korea for two years told me that I would enjoy people watching in Seoul. She was right! Don't miss Insadong if you're in Seoul! It has a bit of everything..."
Excellent lunch,We were taken here as part of a tour and went back the next day on our own as it is quite charming. Interesting shopping and some great little places for Korean lunches.
artsy but very touristy,"This area is touted as the arts district. It may very well be but a lot of the stores sell the same tourist nick-nacs. There are quality/unique products to be found, you just need to look a little harder. "
Street Shopping & Street Food,This is the place to spend a full evening and check many stores selling everything you can imagine. It is nice to buy a few Korean small things for the family!
Insadong,"This is the place where you can find souvenirs at a bargain. Lots of food and restaurants around the area. Try live octopus sashimi for those who are brave at heart. Otherwise, have it cooked or grilled or even in steaming pot of broth"
Great Browsing,NIce for late morning/afternoon browsing. Lost of souvenir options if you are looking for more traditional Korean items. Fun street food carts began to appear at lunch time. Certainly not as intense as Namdamun Market. We kept this for the tail end of our trip.
Unexpected Quaintness,"This is a lovely street far from the thunder of the nearby highways. Street vendors, street artists and antique vendors all combine to make this an almost European experience. But with a signature Korean twist. There are many restaurants serving good, wholesome local cuisine too however, if you're feeling adventurous, try, as I can only describe it, ""a horn of ice cream"". Very amusing."
beautiful place,"it's a small sweet world in itself. picturesque art shop on both sides of a super sweet street in the middle of seoul city center. Do try Korean local outfit at the tourist information center (for approx $3 USD per person for 30 min - reservation recommended but at my of my visit, all slots were available in the afternoon). Kyung-In museum and tea house is a hidden gem. I fell in love with Ohmija and Plum tea served at the traditional tea house in the museum. If you have a day to spent outside shopping malls, then insadong deserves to be part of your plans."
WOW!,"Now this is one part of Seoul that you really do not want to miss. It's fairly costly, but you don't need to buy. Go there just to experience the atmosphere.And please do support the cocktail guy with his cocktails-in-a-bag and his brilliantly crafted world map! Oh, and the honey sweet makers on the metro rail end of the road. They are arguably THE best entertainers there.The restaurants are expensive, so I'd recommend to stroll around and maybe buy a souvenir there and head elsewhere for supper.But do yourself a favour, go about an hour before sunset and watch the whole area transform as sunlight gives way to darkness and the plethora of lights switch on. Lovely!"
"Interesting neighborhood for art galleries, artists shops, souvenirs, tea shops and cafes","Great place to wander around. Interesting artists shops selling artworks, artists materials, like brushes, ink stick, ink stone, and bolts of art paper. Fascinating ! "
Good place to feel Korea..,"C1 ( 2013.07.15 ) There was a many antique shop, souvenir shop, tea cafe, food restaurant in Korean. Many foreigners visited there, and felt Korea's culture. I recommand to drink traditional Korea tea, and eat traditional Korean food there. See, hear, taste, enjoy in Korea, there.."
Worth a Visit for local products,"Insadong area is loaded with shops selling local products and souvenirs. We spent a morning in Ssamzingil as there was a workshop on the lower level where you can make your own souvenir like woodcarving, bottle painting etc. We enjoyed strolling along the alley as there were many interesting things to see. Before buying though, compare prices with different shops to avoid being overcharged."
More time required,"We left this place until our last day, and ran out of time. Yes, as per other reviews, lots of tourists and souvenirs, but scratch the surface a little bit and there are some great little galleries, tea houses and restaurants. Wished we'd had more time than the hour we had there."
Cool place to shop for Souvenirs,"The price is fairly cheap and the vendors are very friendly and informative. You will not fell ""robbed"" here, instead they will recommend you for best prices and best souvenirs. "
Great shopping,Great place to shop for souvenirs. Lots of handmade jewelry for reasonable prices. There are also a few stamp stores where you can get your own name stamp. Some of the store owners are willing to negotiate prices with you.
Not just a tourist spot,"Ok, there are a lot of tourists here. But this is also authentic. There are a number of traditional tea shops and restaurants. Try the ""Yet Chat Jub"" or the old tea shop. "
Fun for souvenirs,This is a wonderful place for souvenir shopping! I did most of it here. They have wonderful and unique things here. I bought my mother a jade necklace. It was beautiful and they're willing to bargain!!
A place not to be missed!,"If you love art and culture, this is a place not to be missed when visiting Korea! I have been there everytime when I visit Seoul and each time I'd discover something new, and not to forget, this is a good place to get Korean made souvenir!! :)"
Good shopping/eating area,"This is a good place for souvenir shopping as there are a whole lot of shops with local handicrafts, which is made in Korea and not China :-)Also there is Little India restaurant that serves Indian cuisine with an Indian ambience."
Great Traditional Gift Shopping,"This place is good for your traditional gift shopping e.g. Korean purses, small wallets, metal spoon and chopsticks, etc. Osulloc green tea cafe can be found in Insadong as well."
Interesting place,It's a great place to seek out conventional and unconventional souvenirs. It is rather near the subway and a convenient place to get to. Patrolling guides are ready to help out the lost tourist. Across the street from the end are several eateries worth exploring. 
Worth visiting,"This is a place mixed with cultural art and modern creativitiy, I think you should go there to take a look!"
Korean tourist trap,"Interesting to see what kind of souvenirs Koreans buy, but very much a tourist trap with some pretty high prices"
Nice shops,"There are some nice shops in the shopping mall there, lots of accessories, and has a tax booth for convenience. Also has a nice O'Sulloc teahouse which you can chill out at. Highly recommended."
"Boutiques, art, and street food make for a fun stroll (and out-weigh the kitsch)","Yes, it's somewhat touristy and full of kitschy souvenirs: but that's not all there is to Insadong, and the casual artsy atmosphere made this area a fun place for roaming around. With plenty of street food and snack shops along the way I wandered up and down the back alleys snacking and stopping in art galleries (there were some nice modern pieces) and boutiques. I skipped by the plethora of super touristy shops full of junk, and instead focused on visiting the galleries off the main street, (you have to really look, some would have been easy to breeze past if my map hadn't told me they were there) and higher end shops with items like hand-made ceramics and jewelry. In the middle was the Ssamji-gil building which was 4 or so stories full of boutique stores bursting with trendy/cute items (fashion accessories, jewelry, toys, hand-made soap, tea, ceramics etc) from local artists. I found it much more fun to spend time walking though here browsing than in the larger malls with chain stores you can find anywhere. It was easy to walk to Insadong after touring Changdeokgung Palace (only the ice in February slowed me down somewhat!) and I'd recommend the combination if visiting this area of the city."
Good if you like to shop,"We wandered over here one morning during our stay in Seoul. We found lots of shops- selling antiques, souvenirs, and all types of food. If you like to shop or need souvenirs, it would be really fun. It wasn't a bad way to get a feel for Seoul at the beginning of our trip, but I don't think it's a must-see. The area is very touristy, but it is close to central Seoul, so if you just want to go for a walk and see part of this city, this is not a bad place to head to."
why why why most restaurants close by 10 PM?,"i thought this is one of Seoul hip areas, but we get here on our way to Hotel at around 10PM at night expecting to be able to grab some nice food but most restaurants were close already..?"
Nice Street,You get to see lots of souvenir stores & some nice snack shops.We walked all the way back to our hotel & it only took us about 25 minutes. 
Great place for souvenir items,"This place is right between Bukchon Hanok village and Cheongye stream, so you can plan a day going to these places when in Seoul. Insadong has its quaint charm though touristy. We enjoyed looking for trinkets to bring home, and, we did bought quite a lot. Aside from the shops, there are lots of resto to choose from. We had a funny experience, though, in one of the shops due to language barrier since the store lady speaks limited English, but all is well that ends well. aside from discounts, we were even given tokens for free! Generally, Koreans are accommodating and good to tourists. They would go out of their way to help despite knowledge of little English. Be sure to make time to visit this place when you're in Seoul."
Excellent Souvinier market,"Insadong is an excellent souvinier market. The feel of the market it very ethnic and yet it is inviting to the visitors. The insadong is a long street and offers many eating joints, Korean tea bars and cafes. "
Nice touristy place,I had a lot of fun walking around by myself in Insadong. Lots of selection of restaurants and shops. Great sightseeing destination!
Great Touristy Area,"We stayed at Hotel Sunbee which is very near this place.Insadong is a great place to just walk around, to browse for knicknacks to bring home :) We also found a great little tea shop on the second floor of one of the buildings in this street :)Definitely a place to visit for souvenir shopping :)"
Markets and crafts.,"A street with Korean arts and crafts, sweets and snacks. Try wandering off the side streets in search of Korean cuisine."
Boring,"typical touristy stuff going on at Insadong. not spectacular. a few galleries, shops selling souvenirs, things seem pricer than the usual hangouts. "
Mostly junky souvenir shops,Not much to recommend Insadong besides one-stop shopping for souvenirs. The street is lined with stores all selling the same touristy stuff mostly made in China. A few nice stores selling prints and ceramics. Clothes are expensive and sized for petite women. A fun shopping mall with stores spiraling around a courtyard. Excellent and expensive tea shop. Try the green tea bonus to share with a friend.
Fun shopping and dining,"Food, shopping and sights are fun. There are a couple options for Korean chicken if you like that! Great at night with bright lights and activity. "
Shopping street,I get the feeling the prices here were rather inflated for tourists. It is a nice place to explore though and some of the food places on this street are worth visiting. Particularly the shaved ice with various toppings. 
A relaxing day in In-sadong,"I would recommend Insadong after you have visited the Bukchon Hanok Village nearby. You can take a bus, less than 10 minutes, to Insadong. The main street is filled with souvenir stores, antique shops, and art galleries that just itch your fingers to buy the goods. Drop by one of the many cafes to relax before continuing your perusal of the street. Being muslims, my friends and I found this vegetarian restaurant off the main street that serves Korean dishes. You can basically cover you souvenir shopping to bring home here, have a break and continue buying those you don't really need because the stuffs there just amazed me."
Fun place to see- great shopping!,"There are tons of art galleries and supplies on this street. It's a fun little shopping street where you can buy lots of momentos and gifts from Korea. Reasonably priced, and near lots of dining options. Good way to spend an hour or two. "
Touristy and expensive,"That being said, it's still your best bet at finding ""Traditional Korean"" souvenirs in Seoul. You'll find most of the same things in the Gukje Sijang in Busan for half the price, though, so save your shopping for Busan! Also, you can bargain with the shopkeepers here. It's a nice place to do window shopping. "
"Losing some of it's historic charm, but still fun","I've been to the Insadong area many times since 1995. It used to be an artistic/cultural area. Good place to eat old-style traditional food and purchase historical crafts and clothing. It's changing now and the traditonal candy makers have been replaced by ice cream shops and other modern stores. There was a new outdoor mall about in the middle of the area. I was a little offended when I first saw it but it turned out to be fun. The place is called Ssamzie-gil complex. It would be easier for you research it on the Internet than for me to describe it. At the very top is a nice coffee shop called Dong Café (yes Dong like in poop.) The staff may offer you a Dong with your drink. Don't be afraid to take it. It just a fried pastry with sweet red bean filling. Koreans used to make those in the shape of fish, so the it was called a fish snack. Don't know why they changed the shape and name...) Don't forget to leave you name on a post-it.The café has a ramp so friendly to strollers. Plus there's an elevator at the restroom end of the café."
Cultural Metropolis,"A fancy, funky and cultural place, Insadong offers great traditional Korean experiences for any traveler. I visited this area on a rainy day, and there were still many people to interact with. Streets are filled to the brim with vendors, and you are bound to find multiple souvenirs for the family back home. Fans, scarfs, pottery, carvings, and so many other items are on display. Not everything in Insadong is about traditional trinkets. You can find hand-painted canvases that are breath taking. The rocky road you travel on through the market place seems to just breath history. Along every side street you can find a place to eat or sit and drink tea or coffee. Stop and take a rest and enjoy watching the buzz of people in the streets. If you're a fan of art, Insadong is a great stop while in Seoul. Along with traditional features, Insadong also seemed to be the home of many creative people. I went into one building with multiple stores on many levels. As I took the stairs to wander up to the next few floors, I noticed that there were many pictures and ""doodles"" painted on the walls. A giant bunch of metal roses winded up through the staircase. It really was a breathtaking sight. I only spent about an hour in the area, but I would suggest that if you were to visit, plan on staying for awhile. There is so much to see, and you wouldn't want to miss out!"
downtown,"is a neighborhood unremarkable, with a lot of art galleries full of commercial art even more inconsequential, ordinary restaurants and nothing special"
This is the place to shop for souvenirs,"My friend from Seoul took me here. This is the street full of tea houses or restaurants. you can order Hot or Cold tea, and you can get free refil. outside there are lots of Souvenirs. like the tradional korean fan, The korean tradional clothes (hambuk) as figurines, and you can also try a hambuk and take a picture of you're self! :D Did I mention you can buy PSY socks for 2,000 Won or $ 2US dolloers.. This is a great place to buy korean Souvenirs.They even have a Souvenir store in the street, and right outside beside the Souvenir store ther is a place there you can take a picture of the tradional clothes the Hambuk"
Good place to shop for souvenirs,"My friend and I visited this place during one of our last days in Korea and I bought most of my souvenirs here too..the shops here sells things from Korean fans to key chains to bookmarks etc..so it's really an ideal place to get souvenirs. Also, this place has many antique stores that sells paintings and vases. Quite a good shopping area for souvenirs in my opinion. :)"
Lovely area,I went on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't even that crowded which was nice. The buildings are really traditional looking which looks beautiful to me. There's lots of stores here (this is not the place to shop for clothes) and restaurants.
Touristy but still vibrant,"These few blocks of eclectic stores, galleries, craft stores, restaurants, cafes and tea halls. While the numbers of interesting galleries and antiques stores (those that actually offer antiques, not just replicas) has declined there is still plenty to see and experience. Craft stores and small designers, music and relatively authentic restaurants can be found along with stores offering affordable wares tourists may want to pick up, like woodwork, ceramics, teas, and mass produced crafts. Its always fun to visit."
Lovely cultural place,Love the way the designers got a place to showcase their talents. Super-loving Ssamziegil. That place is just way too awesome and a great place to make a hole in your pocket!
Old korea charm,"Go to Insadong if you want to get a taste of traditional Korea - culture, art & cuisine. you will find many good restaurants offering authentic korean cuisine, art galleries, and souveneir shops."
for the arty people,"museums/ crafts paradise, also a heaven for traditional tea lovers: many shops with beautiful tea sets and cups and glasses of all kinds. Also craft shops, and handicraft on sale. Though expect slightly arty prices for the ""design"" and ""craftsmanship"" involved"
Tourist Friendly,This is one of my favorite places in Seoul. You can buy souvenirs here but it is cheaper in Namdaemun Market. The shopkeepers speak English. And there is a building where you can reach the top just by walking around and looking at the shops. 
Nice Stroll Along Insadong,"After our visit to Bukchon, we took a nice stroll to Insadong. Not very far if you walk along the school walls.Insadong has a mixed of shops and worth the stroll there. Great place to buy souvenirs and prices are alright. Traditionally stuff can also be found there."
Lots of fun,Great place for street shopping experience esp for souvenirs. Can go to Insa Korea if weather too hot. Prices comparable. 
nice street,"the main street is nice, if you are looking for traditional souvenirs.The street was clean and people were friendly, but they are there for the tourists, so..."
Insadong - Yeot and Dasic,"When I visited Insadong, it was quite cold. Even so, my work colleages were excited about the atmosphere of Insadong. We had a dinner at a Traditional Korean Restaurant, Hanjungsik, formal Korean cuisine. At Insadong, there were many street shops and we bought some yeot (Korean taffy). Another shop had dasic, which is traditional style, Korean biscuit. I hope that Insadong will reserve its Korean traditional elements."
Full of people and small shops!,Very live place with people walking everywhere. Most of them are eating or drinking something while walking with family and friends. Lots of small shops to buy small things and souvenirs.
Great little art street,"One of my favourite places in Seoul, nice little street with lots of arty stuff. There is a nice cafe at the top of one of the building, go have a cuppa there after walking down half the street."
Traditional Shopping place,"You can find a lot of traditional item in here.cheaper than myeongdong.Interesting think is I found one shop that the Korean can speak Indonesian, Japanese, Thai and other language.Need to check this place.."
Cultural hub,Cultural hub of Seoul. It is a place where you can buy good souvenirs and find a good restaurant. You can see street performers and various stalls. It is nice to have a walk from 5 pm till night..
Shopping,We were taken here by local seoul residents. Definitely an under 30 event. Shops had much higher quality souvenirs and handmade items. Coffee shops and restaurants everywhere. Went to a 5 story open air mall that was all Ramps. Side streets worth a look
Quaint Shopping Lane,Insadong is less than a mile stretch filled with stores and street vendors. It can get pretty crowded especially on the weekends but it's a fun 2-3 hour stop. You can find some pretty cheap souvenirs to take back home and don't forget to explore the side streets where most of the cafes and restaurants are at.This is where we had our first silkworm experience and the taste and smell still haunt me.
fun place to visit on a weekend,"lots of cool stores, galleries, vendor stalls and restaurants. I've also caught musical and cultural acts. It gets very crowded on the weekends but it's low stress since you can just walk around or sit down and people watch"
lovely insadong,"i really love this walking street you, there have many coffee shop, resturant and surviner also if you have a chance to walk along insadong street you would love it"
"Tourist, but do sit down for some tea","This place is very touristy, but otherwise, it wouldn't have been preserved...so I have no complaints. if you don't want to brave the Namdaemoon flea market, this place has nice selection of Korean art and crafts items. Also, make sure to go into side streets for actually authentic food and some of the nicest traditional tea houses."
"Touristy yes, but since when is that a bad thing?",This is a pedestrian(ish) style street full of local craft souvenirs and cheap eats and drinks. It is also a good place to people watch as there are locals and visitors about and the occasional street entertainer. Close buy is the recently redeveloped small river area which is lovely for a stroll or jog.
very touristy.,"i was expecting more so was kinda disappointed when there wasn't much to see or shop in insadong. there are shops selling souvenirs which reminds me very much of shops in chinatown.there is a small shopping mall there but it wasn't as exciting as I hope it would be. but a good thing is we got lost when we walked from myeodong to insadong, and we were finding our way in samcheongdong which is more interesting. there are alot of nice cafes there, and i see some interesting shops which were closed as I was there on a Sunday. and altho there are alot of tourists there, but it doesn't feel as touristy and commercialised as insadong. take a nice stroll down the rows of cafes."
Well worth a stroll down this traditional road. Lots of cheap bargains and things to eat,Insadong is a must see for visitors to Seoul. You will see people in traditional clothes and can buy any kind of souveneir and also try some traditional snacks. There are restaurants and tea shops off the main road that are worth exploring. Tip: this is where you can get a picture of yourself taken in traditional clothes. I did it this month for $25. Be careful - they do try to upsell you. Good point is they are willing to take a few pics of your on your own phone or camera as well.
Good Shopping if You Take Time to Look,"I found some good gifts here, but I had to look beyond everything that was most prominent. The crowds can leave you feeling less than enthused, but there are some very cool things to look at. Be sure to bargain, and don't be afraid to walk away. "
Korean crafts along one street,"This is the shopping spot for traditional Korean crafts. We had a goal, to buy a Korean mask requested by a friend and we did find one. We also purchased a lovely Korean design thumbdrive for a friend and a fish windchime for ourselves."
Arts & Craft Shopping Street,"Good place to go for a lunch are some trinket shopping. More of a younger vibe in this area, and I would recommend doing it if you are in the area such as Bukucho. Not far from the Palace."
A nice and traditional place,"I spent half a day at insadong and it is really memorable. It was snowing then and the streets are covered with snow. A walk through this traditional street is good, and there are lots of shops selling souvenirs for you to bring back home!"
Good for slow relaxing stroll,"It is a long stretch of shops selling many traditional stuff/souvenirs. We went there mainly to visit Ssamziegil to get some souvenirs. Ssamziegil is worth a visit for unique souvenirs. I realized that there were some nice restaurants with good crowd at the small alleys nearby, but too bad we just had lunch elsewhere."
Neat Stretch of Road,"Insadong is a neat little stretch of road. I say road, but there really aren't that many cars driving through. It's mostly for pedestrians. I noticed a lot of people call it touristy. That may be the case, but I didn't get that vibe.When we went through the area, we ate some good food at an upstairs restaurant, had delicious tea on the patio of a traditional tea house, and shopped for the usual trinkets, souvenirs, and gifts. Of course, there's plenty of street food, but as I've discovered, you find that all over Seoul.If there is one touristy thing, it's the loud and very entertaining guys making the fine strands of dough that they then use to wrap chocolate and nuts. I call it horse hair. It's incredible how fine they can make that stuff by hand."
Return to the history of Seoul.,The street has a number of vendors for Korean traditional gifts and snacks and restaurants. The whole concept is a return to tradition and very foreigner friendly. Best time to visit is lunch to early evening as the area closes relatively early.
Place to shop and eat,"Place with many shops of all kind goods, starting souvenirs, pottery and cosmetics. There are also some really nice little restaurants to have lunch or dinner. I would agree to former reviews, this place is touristy, but it is not bad and really worth a go."
Too Touristy,"It's full of people and tourists...it's very artificial.If you want to buy souveneirs or people watching this is a good place. other than that, no need to go. "
"Very touristy, but still good","Mostly geared towards visitors, shops are selling the typical kitsch that you would want to take home to your kids, aunt, ex-girlfriends, etc. Most of the staffs I notice speak English to some degree and there are some nice galleries, which have free admission. Food is a little expensive around here, but the street food seems to be cheap and tasty. The street isn't that long, but if you have the legs, keep walking north to Samchungdong and you will find more locals around there, in a neighborhood that is a bit less touristy but still very cool. "
pleasant.,"Good pleace to enjoy Korean culture and street food.A lot of tasty street food,westernly delicious.There are good grean tea houses,art galleries and souvenir shops .Closed road,easy to walk."
nice touristy area in Seoul,I like its proximity to the hotel where we stayed in the Jongno-3 area.I also like the shops and the street food stalls at its southern end.Ssamziegil mall was a treat to the eyes especially at night and the restos around it served good Korean food at reasonable prices.This is a must-visit in Seoul.
Artsy part of Seoul,It is always fun to walk between the small shops and art galleries. There is a lot of nice stuff instead of just touristy crap that you find in so many other places.
Arts and Shopping,"While Myeongdong is all about shopping, I liked Insadong better for the independent shops, street exhibitions and an artist village somewhere in the middle of Insadong. "
Lovely place to go,"Very authentic place in korea. You can try some nice food and browse cute korean items. Definitely go into the plaza halfway down isadong- it has quite a few levels and you can even take sticker pictures right on the top floor.We stopped by a really pretty cafe that served tea and green tea chocolates which was really relaxing, and warming considering it was snowing at the time!Lot's of traditional items available, and a nice place for exploring as there are so many little side streets."
Best place I've ever been to in Seoul!!,"Insa-dong is very an authentic place in korea. I could try nice korean foods and have some good experiences like making korean rice cake. It's also not very difficult to visit because it's located in the centre of Seoul. Also, it's close to Samcheong-dong which has many good cafe and restaurants!! I love this place a lot!! "
Few good restaurants and alleys,"If you're a traditional Korean art fan, here's the place to go. There's a few small alleys with food available, and it was so good that we went back twice! "
great bargains and atmosphere,"A bit of a tourist trap but a really nice one. Nothing seedy here, clean, busy and full of great restaurants hidden in side streets. In summer there are special traditional performances for tourists and guides to help you are everywhere"
Great food and shopping,"Once the shops in Insadong are open, this is a great place for local eateries and shopping. there are a few tax free shops, traditional Korean embroideries, paper, ink, and the like. I loved the local food scene, just be prepared that it might be hard to match the name of places if you are reading an English travel guide with the Korean scripts on name of store. I found matching the phone number seems to work somewhat.The shops don't open till 9:30 or 10 am, except a couple of places that open around 8:30, if you are a early raiser, be prepared to take pictures with less crowd in the morning. :) "
good place to shop,if you go here you have to go to anuk station. some locals dont know how to go here so better ask the info person in the subway stations. souvenirs are cheap and very near to the city like palace and blue house.
The Place To Be.,"Fortunately I stayed in Insadong. It was a great artsy area with restaurants, galleries, musicians and a wonderful lively and fun vibe. Its open till about 8:30 or 9 PM. There is also an information kiosk and the Metro Anguk Station exit 6 is very close."
For Art people,"For me, Insadong is just okay to walk around but I prefer to buy things in the Namdaemun Market. There you can find art things and nice buildings. I went there only when I had to buy the Nami Island entrance and bus ticket. Also went to Ssamziegil (unique shopping construction withouth elevator). I hope next time can go the Jongno Tower and the Changdeukgong Place near it."
Neat for souvenier shopping,"This is a good little spot for souvenir shopping - we got several small things to take home in this area. There are some traditional arts as well as a much more modern art area. There are also several small restaurants on the side streets. This district is also between some of the temples and palaces, so if you make the trip out you can also walk to some other areas. Make sure to look in several different stores to see where you can get the best deal - some, but not all, places may negotiate. There is also a shop that will dress you up in traditional outfits and take pictures (there is a heavy fee for this but it looked like fun!). We went out to the area at least twice during our visit since it was a nice place to just walk around and poke into air conditioned shops in the summer time"
Great to hang out strolling,"Give yourself 2 hours to stroll around insa Dong and side alleys. Great galleries, tea houses, and cheap souvenir shops "
Crowded,Went on a Sunday and it was very busy. It's loads of shops of Korean handicrafts. Nice to visit and just walk around.
Great atmosphere,"Nice sunday afternoon with local dance performances, flea market, souvineir shopping, art galleries, cafes et al."
Variety!,"A whole variety of souvenir items but what may turn tourists off is that the sales people are too ill-mannered. Although we don't understand them very much, we know that they become mean if they realize you're not buying anything and you can't even touch their stuff to check them out! There's a LOT of food totally unique of Korea, it was fun trying everything out. We could have stayed longer in the area if it weren't for time constraint. We can't help buying various souvenirs. If you have more time than we did (30 minutes), I suggest checking the stores first before buying because there's so much to choose from and each store offers something different you might end up buying the whole of Insadong."
Great place to shop and eat,"Consistent in being able to produce the things that I was looking for at reasonable prices , may not be dirt cheap like hoeyeon, but the quality of the items are worth the price you pay for. Just roam around the area and do drop by Jogyesa Temple which is also so near. A must visit in Seoul ;) "
Outstanding tea houses and Korean shops,"This vibrant neighborhood is one of the cultural and artistic hubs of Seoul. Great tea houses, restaurants, street food, galleries and souvenir shops make it a must-see area. Try Min's Club for an authentic Korean meal and then later slip into one of many dozens of tea houses for a traditional tea. Great for tourists and people of all ages."
Isadong,"I highy suggest on a gd sunny day to visit this place it has shops , food carts and lots and lots of things to see , one can just sit down and enjoy the crowd passing you by and yet still relaxing regardless or walking or just taking in some local food Great place thumbs up"
A nice stroll through the artistic area of Seoul,"Great place to shop for souvenirs along a narrow street of museums, art houses, restaurants and cafes"
Great place to spend a rainy day,"We found souvenirs of our trip to Korea which were well crafted. Insadong had a lot of merchandise which we did not see at other street markets. Art galleries were worth visiting as well as the many shops. Even though it was raining so the street vendors weren't there, the art and antique shops were wonderful."
really good traditional Korean food at Insadong,You can found really good traditional Korean food here. Make sure you only choose to eat at those where the staffs only speak Korean and not Chinese.
Trendy place to visit,"Love the area. It's a mix of modernism and tradition. Definitely must visit Ssamzie-gil Complex. The shops sell artsy, trendy, and cute things. Most of the shops sell accessories. You can find some of them at a cheaper price in Dongdaemun though. "
A pleasant district to while away a few hours,"This was the location of my hotel, just off the main street of Insadong-gil. It’s a touristy road, mostly pedestrianised with occasional cars. Lots of art, craft and souvenir shops and a small multi-level mall with the same shops. There are some interesting things to look at and good photographic opportunities. Towards the south end you’ll find street market stalls. Heading further south will lead you to a bigger shopping area, underground markets, and the interesting Cheongaecheon canal which flows through the city. At the north end of Insadong-gil you’ll find the two most popular palaces of Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung, and the Bukchon Hanok village. It’s a pleasant district to spend an afternoon or longer wandering around."
Interesting Insadong,"Insadong has something for everyone. Not a very long street but it was full of shops and eateries. Shops that sell generic tourist souvenirs, artisan's creation (e.g. potteries), paintings, cosmetics etc. I noticed there were quite a number of shops that sell all sorts of handmade papers and brushes of all sizes. Would be great if you are into painting or calligraphy. I saw there was an interesting shop with a very old sign selling the all too unique Korean brass bowls and utensils. There were a whole range of dining options in Insadong, from restaurants, simple cafes to street food. We joined a long line waiting for the freshly deep-fried sweet dough (KRW 1,000 each) and walnut-shaped muffins with red bean paste (KRW 5,000 for 6). Not super tasty but interesting snacks for the afternoon. We stopped by O'Sulloc Tea House. They occupied a 3 storey building, with a tea shop on the first floor, the main cafe on 2/F and private rooms on 3/F. Chic furniture. All sorts of tea and tea snacks were available, especially green tea. All items were beautifully presented, like pieces of art. I liked their green tea tiramisu. Not cheap (KRW 18,000 for a tea and a piece of cake) but hot tea can be re-filled. I would highly recommend it for a stopover in between shopping and pick up some wonderfully fragrant tea leaves as souvenirs. In the middle of Insadong, there was a multi-storey complex that housed lots of little shops selling all sorts of handmade items and artists creation. Check out the handmade accessories, hand-painted tees, vases, handbags, umbrellas etc. Reminds me of Taiking Lu (aka Tianzifang) in the former French Concession in Shanghai, before it got way too commercialized and became a tourist ghetto. In basement 1 level, workshops were offered for pottery, hand-painted glass etc. Check out the love locks cafe on the roof terrace or the famed Gogung Bibimbap restaurant (listed in the Michelin guide) at the basement 1 level. Insadong was a great place to spend an afternoon in Seoul."
Insadong souvenirs,"Insadong is a place where you can find many Korean souvenirs. There are also handicrafts and artworks for those who love to collect items. There are also plenty of restaurants and food stalls. There was even a bulding that houses many shops that sell bags, accessories, clothes, and other items."
Tourist gifts ^^,"I probably visited Insadong 4 times during my 3 week stay in Seoul. It's a bit hard to find at first but thankfully I already had friends in Seoul to give me a free tour ^^ On our first visit, we nearly ran into SHINEE (if you're a kpop lover, you know who I'm talking about!!!!) Insadong has lots of tiny shops catering to cheap tourist gifts, lots of cafes, galleries and a stage for live performances. "
"Shops for everyone, explore Korean culture here.","Selling wooden mask, calligraphy tools, hand made jewellery, hand craft work, pot and vase. Anything one like collections, just drop by. Here also have some street snack for take away. Artist open shops to sell their own art piece here. Don't worry for food, restaurant and cafe mostly on 1st floor in buildings. Don't miss out the Bukchon Hanok Village nearby, just 650m away. Tourist information located at beginning of the street."
tourist shopping area,Insadong is a big shopping area aimed mainly towards tourists. This is the area where you'll find souvenirs for your friends back at home. There are also lots of restaurants especially on the side streets.
awesome shopping,awesome shopping and great cafe's literally everywhere. Loved the streets and ambiance. A little pricey.
Souvenir paradise,"Insadong is a central neighborhood full of souvenir shops. There you will see lots of decorative pieces made of mother of pearl, specially boxes and plates. There are also beautiful jewels, ceramic, wooden masks....Prices are not low, but things in general are beautiful and of good quality. You can haggle to get a discount of 5-10%. Also interesting are the stores specialized in products for oriental calligraphy that sell brushes of all sizes.The area has many restaurants and snack places.Most stores close at dusk. Some are tax free."
Very authentic old Seoul,"A place for culture and arts lovers.All the ancient narrow streets, are a walk into the old Séoul , with plenty of stylish tile roofs, small typical tea salon, and traditional restaurants. So typical."
Place to eat/shop,"Insadong sells mainly Korean cultural items and some other souvenir-worthy stuff. For a guy like me, all I'm interested in is the many eateries they have along this street :)"
Great souvenier shopping,This is the place to see traditional crafts and good shopping for memories to take home. Be sure to stop into a tea shop for a break from shopping.
Adorable street that suits everyone!,"We loved Insadong - it's a great place to walk around, get a taste of Korea, buy souvenirs, and see many different types of galleries. It's close to most of the tourist spots, and if you don't have a problem walking 20 minutes, it's really great to add to the palaces (otherwise, just take the subway one stop). The prices of the souvenirs are a bit high, but in their defense, we didn't see them cheaper anywhere else. Keep in mind that even though these are real stores, you can still bargain with the prices in most places."
where we can shop good stuffs,"insa dong street has line of shops. they sell souvenirs, paintings, handicrafts, scarves etc. good for people who like arts and antique stuffs."
Art and tea,"Nice art galleries with some of the most wonderful tea shops. Venture through the small alley ways, surprises await."
One of the best attractions,The place was quite attractive to foreigners. There are many Korean traditional things that you can see and buy. One of the best attractions in Seoul.
a change of pace in Insadong,"Wish I had found this nook sooner into my trip! Lovely architecture, great boutique shops & tea houses, and--if possible--less crowded than other parts of Seoul."
Buy souvenirs here,"It is place where you can buy many interesting things from ceramic pots to jewelry. Insadong street is very long and full of shops with handmade dishes, clothes, souvenirs etc. Some shops are like museum. You may try to bargain but you'll get a discount only if you pay by cash. "
Lovely little street,"When I lived in Seoul I would love going here for some nice tea and for little trinkets. I would always bring visitors here and we would wander the greet just looking at all the little shoppes. It's a cute area and such a nice, relaxing treat in the middle of one of the worlds largest metropolitans. "
Cute place,"Cute place to stroll around. Lots of nice korean souvenir, and cultural craft shops. Beautiful alleyway. Lots of charm. Recommend having tea at a tea house."
Art street,"This is my second visit to Insadong, wanting to have a nice relaxing time strolling and browsing this is the place to go.Yes, it's touristy but not crazy busy. The Main Street is filled with many shops selling trinkets, souvenirs, pottery and galleries.Be sure to wonder the smaller streets and be lured into many different eateries and more galleries.There weren't to many food stalls as it was raining but be sure to try a shop which had some baked sweet treats, it's shaped like a walnut with waffle like pastry with a red bean filling a walnut centre.$3000 won got me about 8 lots...There was also 2 information ambassador standing opposite Korea tourist centre, there were very proactive and was on hand to help with any questions.A good place to hang out if you are looking or a few hours to kill...."
Worth spending an hour here,Its best to go there early around 9:00 am when the souvenir shops open to get a good deal. Worth seeing the old post office and the Buddha temple in the vicinity.
Charming!,"I totally enjoyed my time at Insadong. It's quite a touristy area where you can find a nice mix of souvenir shops, accessories shops, bakery (modern n traditional types), cultural handicraft centre, and Korean skincare shops. This place is charming. Lots of avid photographers around, too."
Cultural journey,Wonderful place with lots of cultural items as well as souvenirs! Spoilt for choices for restaurants and we visited the Tea Museum and drank tea at a traditional tea house. Awesome experience and choice of tea for our well being. A must do when in Seoul.
nice,"cute stores, many places to eat. very busy, especially on weekends. didn't buy anything, but it's a nice atmosphere."
Traditional Korea and souvenirs,"Visit the tourist kiosk Right before entering insadong street and just right after coming out from the subway.they will give you a map and tips for any of your questions.The day we were there, they set up ,right before the subway exit, a number of traditional Korean delicacies for a Korean wedding.it was manned by Koreans wearing traditional costumes.Try the Korean waffle sold right before exiting the subway, it has honey/syrup with butter? Sandwiched between the waffle..not to be missed.we only found it here,tried looking for it in the other places..couldn't find it.Insadong is where you can find traditional Korean souvenirs to take home..bookmarks,fans,magnets,pens,artworks,and other knickknacks.prices are the same from shop to shop.haggling is not the norm.stuff are more or less the same from shop to shop too.There are a lot of restaurants around,reasonably priced,when you are ready for a meal.Best paired with a visit to the nearby bukchon."
Best traditional souvenir experience and shopping place in Seoul,"There are many markets out there but this one is the best for souvenirs! I was in Seoul three times in the last year and I cant get enough of this place. Great street food, good restaurants. You can bargain here! Yes there are various Official Tourism stores that are a little more expensive but they give you great ideas of the traditional gifts to go out to the other stores to bargain!Various temples at either end of the street and a Palace. Get the Donuts that are 2000 won! Delicious! We found a place to have fish eat the dead cells of off our feet for 9000 won.. interesting experience! They also have legit massage parlors as well"
Isadong st,Great shopping and a terrific temple off of insadong-11. The shopping district is loaded with restaurants that have English menus. 
Place to walk around,This is a lovely place to stroll and walk around jus to have a look at old shophouses but the items sold are quite expensive compared to other places like Myeongdong.
culture heaven,a great collection of interesting little shops and stalls and a great atmosphere. Fun to just walk around and try some of the interesting food carts.
Lovely little marketplace!,"If you are looking for artists and street vendor foods - this is the place for you in Seoul!Most of the souvenier vendors have the same items - so look around, and don't feel pressure, you will see the items again! The street vendor food here is fantastically Korean - so come hungry and ready to try!!"
nice,Nice area to walk around. Lots of food street vendors. The stores seemed more expensive than Myeongdong. Not many english speakers. Streets were clean and felt safe. 
Lots of arts & crafts souvenirs and lovely TEA!,"Be sure to stock up on varieties of good Korean tea in Insadong. One of my favorite shops is O'Sulloc, which is diagonally across from my FAVORITE tea shop whose name i can't remember. Either way, you'll satisfy your need for cute Korean souvenirs that you may deem (aggiejaggie), as well as great traditional restaurants. Try to spend a whole day or at least an afternoon strolling around Insadong. It's one of the more interesting neighborhoods in Seoul. "
shopping for souvenirs...," everything can be found here,from really cheap to much more exclusive and expensive artifacts.Plus, nice tea parlours,coffee shops and restaurants"
Insadong is a fun place to visit!,"Yes, this place is kind of touristy, but I still love it. I've done quite a bit of souvenir shopping here for my family. There are terrific restaurants as well as street food vendors. On Saturday this place is even better since there's a variety of street performers."
Favourite Place in Korea,"The main street is admittedly touristy (albeit a awesome place to pick up cheap souveniors for friends and family), but the galleries, teahouses and shops in the many many alleys is really the place to be. Also, theres' an incredible hotteok stall halfway down the mainstreet. You can't miss it, there's a queue pretty much everytime I pass the place. Really lovely deep fried peanut/cinnamum/sugar filled doughnutty goodness. "
Good to see Korean old stuff,"Insadong is very famous for tourist attraction in Korea. If you are visiting Korea, this is good place to see. Then you must go to Changduk Palace (formerly Secret Garden) which is one of the well kept places in Korea."
A myriad of Art,insadong is not just a shopping area but a cultural showcase as well. Insadong is a melting pot of diverse art where you see different kinds of crafts regardless of any style whether western or eastern designs. Insadong is a place where you could buy souvenirs and of course a must buy is the King's dessert where you will enjoy those people making it. They do entertaining chants so it will definitely capture you and spend a bit for their dessert.
overpriced and repetitive,"Everybody sells the same, asking prices it's not worth even bargaining about. No antiques anywhere, just fakes from China. Only good thing is the street food.. Yum, I can still smell it now."
a nice pedestrian street: lots of souvenir shops and restaurants,"We visited this area on a sunny March morning: it gives you an idea of Korean street food ( wish we had time to explore more), we saw some restaurants we would have liked to visit and a few souvenir shops we would buy souvenirs from, if our house was not so small and so full of souvenirs from all around the world!"
'Vintage' Korea with a side of cinnamon tea,"An artsy, cluttered place with fascinating little shops full of handcrafted paper and paperie, calligraphy supplies, furniture, and 'antiques'. Many art galleries and fun cafes. You may run across craftsmen making turn-of-the-century pulled-honey candies, a sand-drawing exhibition, a yut seller clacking his bronze scissors, students looking to practice their English, or an impromptu performance artist."
Comparing food making the honey strings to italian pasta,"Street food is always so interesting to watch. Here they take a hard piece of white stone like made of honey and by stretching it a few THOUSAND times,in front of your eyes, they turn it to almost sweet ""cotton"" in the very same way that trattorias in Italy stretch their pasta in spaghettini. The area is very pleasant to walk and browse."
best authentic korean food and great shopping,"Cheap and lovely meal for korean food, shopping is also great but you can find them in the market in Dongdaemun"
good place to get souvenirs,"u want to buy traditional korea souvenirs? this is the place to go.lots of shops.many restaurants, cafes as well.if u r a big shopper, u can easily spend 3-4 hrs there. otherwise, it's a nice stroll in <1-hr through the entire street with a few quick stops here and there to look around.well organized.easy to get to by subway.shops have prices that are clearly labeled. won't feel like being swindled by street vendors."
too touristy,"most of the goods here are ""made in china"", at least they are exactly the same things you can find in any tourist district all over asia. the upside was there was some traditional dancing being performed in the street, which was nice"
Never saw enough,"Stumbled on this little gem, did not see lots, but what we did see was great. This is on the ""NEXT"" time list, a relaxing walk through cute shops. But alas time won out.....but ""I'LL BE BACK!"""
Lots to see,"I came across this area by chance but i really like it. The whole area have been pedestrianised for easy strolling. There were a lot shops selling variety of stuffs like souveneer, clothes, shoes, jewelleries, food and restaurant. I like one particular vegetarian restaurant where i had my lunch. Unfortunately i forgot its name. But it was quite deeply located from the main road. Its at the end of those small lanes. The food there was good and the price was reasonable. For Muslim looking for food you should come here. Because finding halaal food in Seoul, especially in Insadong is a challenge.Insadong is difficult to enjoy in just one day, especially if you like to browse the shop one by one. Spare at least one whole day there. Rest when you are tired. Its best to enjoy when the weather is good though."
My favourite Seoul neighborhood,"Best place in Seoul to visit for traditional Korean souvenirs, paintings, and homemade crafts. Don't miss out the narrow side streets there, there're lots of traditional tea houses, restaurants & galleries for you to explore!"
A walk to remember,"Never get enough to walk along the insadong street just to smell the flavor of Korea, enjoying the traditional tea of Korea, and buy items that originally made in Korea..."
Lovely and colorful place,"I enjoyed walking along the streets in Insadong, watch the colorful signs of shops, sellers of ricecake, a bouquet of street food scents. Very cute and cosy."
Good place for shopping,This is a nice place to spend a couple of hours. Lots of different types of stores from more traditional Korean to pure souvenier stands. If you are looking to buy some things for the folks back home then this is the place to go. Lots of restaurants too.
traditional,an amazing street full of traditional korea gifts and artwork. I always find something new to bring back with me. not to be missed.
Insadong for souvenirs.,"I love Insadong for the many shops which sell an abundance of souvenirs as well as arts and craft items.. There are also many restaurants there and our favorite is the one which sells genuine Jeonju style bibimbab! Not forgetting kkultare, the traditional candy which is made on the spot by enthusiastic young men."
"The traditional side of Seoul, a must visit place","If you want to feel the traditional Korean, this is the place to visit. And there is also a starbuck available which carries the korean name. For traditional gifts and stuffs, this is indeed the best place to go"
Art,"You can find some great gifts of Korea in this area. Know for it's Art Insadong is a great place to find paintings, prints and homemade Korean cookware. We go often to shop and find a new place to eat. It's within walking distance from largest palace in Seoul."
a great place to buy cultural souvenirs,if you are looking for small souvenirs to give to friends back at home. i think you have the highest chances to find it here than other places. Almost every other stores sell souvenirs. There are also starbucks stores. The Starbucks sign is in Koreans instead of English! I found it to be neat they do it that way.
For the art lovers,If you like arts then visit this area. They have some lovely arts in this area. You can shop for nice pottery in this area too. Rice cake museum is just a few blocks from here too.
Beautiful Place,"Insandong is interesting and have multiple options to buy art, go to the cinema, walk in the streets and just be a people watcher. Use comfort shoes and enjoy the ride. "
Fantastic,"This is one of the too destinations to go to when in seoul. This district is lined with art galleries and shops where you can find cultural souvenirs and interesting nick nacks. There are also trendy art shops that sell vintage toys and accessories. In this area you will also find a lot of interesting cafes and restaurants that make you feel you're in ""old korea"" many food stalls selling street food are also seen - do try the hotteok it's a must!"
Souvenirs heaven,"Plenty of shops to get your souvenirs from. Do look around first as some shops may offer the same thing at a slightly cheaper price. Also, there is one shop selling bags (all kinds) at only 10,000won each. "
Great artsy place not to miss,"This is one of the too destinations to go to when in seoul. This district is lined with art galleries and shops where you can find cultural souvenirs and interesting nick nacks. There are also trendy art shops that sell vintage toys and accessories. In this area you will also find a lot of interesting cafes and restaurants that make you feel you're in ""old korea"" many food stalls selling street food are also seen - do try the hotteok it's a must! "
Good street food,"This is one neighbourhood that you will want to visit again and again. You can find just about anything to buy at a much lesser cost compared to other shopping sites. Spend a couple of hours and do not miss the street food -- most of them are freshly made, right in front of you and they taste too good. We tried the pan-cake and wish we had one of these shop where we live.Apart from food and inexpensive shops, there are quite a few historically relevant sites viz. Beautiful Tea Musuem, Hanji People (we could not find this thoug), to name a few. You can find uniformed Insadong ambassadors (guides to help you navigate the streets)."
"Arts, crafts, souvenirs, and food",On the second half of our trip we decided to stay near Anguk Station not knowing Insadong was so close to our place. It was nice to see the first Starbucks that had to be written in a different language because the law in Insadong is to have all the signs in Korean. Our friend told us Insadong is the best place to not get ripped off when buying traditional Korean souvenirs or anything else on that street because they are not allowed to sell things different from the price posted. There is no smoking allowed on this street.
Nice Shopping / Eating Area - Good Crafts,Great area for eating and shopping for crafts. This place has lots of little streets to be explored. Lots of street food and authentic restaurants. 
Best place to shop by far,"Not the cheapest, and this is not the place to look for cutting edge fashion at discounted prices, but Insadong is the place to find traditional paper products, clothes, food, arts, and antiques. If you are limited on time, make sure to plan a few hours here. It is right off a subway stop and coffee shops abound. If you have more time, you can go to the Namdenum or dongdemun markets and find similiar or the same products for a little less, but it is highly likely the difference will only be a few cents. As is the case throughout Korea, expect to find no clothing over about a size 10 women's, and no shoes over a 7 or so. Iaetwon would be the exception.Also, note that their Large is generally not the large you get in the US. While I am a large in US sizes, sometimes the XXL in Korea was too small."
Nice to go for gifts and to eat,"It is a good place to go and to fill the spirit of Seoul. There are a lot of different shops, restorants and small crossing streets that make this place lovely.Unfortunately in most of the shops for souveniers you can find the same items but still on good price, especially compared with the duty free shops at the airport. So if you want to buy simething - buy it from there.Also there are lovely small shops for traditionak arts - like caligrafy brushes so if you like such things this is the place. Tottaly recommended"
Reminded Me of Time Square,At night the stores light large signs that give the feeling you are in Time Square. It is electrifying. I liked walking on the streets just looking up at the lit signs.
A must shopping district,"A Canadian expat told me about this street and I am so happy I was able to spend time browsing. It's a great place to find a wide variety of local products and crafts. Also I loved the narrow side streets with cafes and coffeeshops, wonderful for exploring. "
very Interesting,"If you really like art that will be your favorite place, many shops have really good stuff and art galleries. I went 3 times there and enjoyed my time. "
Cute cobbled street,Lots of shopping and good eating opportunities here. The street itself is very cute and nice to walk along. There are a few shops making traditional korean sweets and you can watch the process. Access insadong via jongakk or Anguk metro stations. 
Shopping and People Watching,"This is one of my favorite places in Seoul. The shops here sell beautiful traditional crafts and lately the art industry has really kicked off here. You can see art galleries selling some of Korea's best artist's work. The handcrafted jewelry here is unique, it is usually made out of traditional stones like amethyst and jade, combined with silver. But my favorite thing to do here is to go up to the second level of a cafe or tea shop and look down on all the shoppers and sales people. If you go on Sunday, the road is closed to cars."
Favorite Seoul neighborhood,"We enjoy exploring Insadong with ever trip to Seoul. Our favorite time is round the Buddha's Birthday in May or June, when celebrations at Jogyesa Temple spill out into the streets and everything is resplendent with lanterns, but it's a pleasure to wander and people-watch any time of year. "
Great place for souviners,"Insadong was my last stop on my vacation in Seoul. My purpose for visiting was to buy souviners and I found some really cool, unique places to shop. You can find traditional Korean souviners as well as handmade items and unique gifts. There are also some upscale jewelry, pottery, and art stores. I enjoyed looking at all of the Korean works of art. I could have spent a long time in Insadong, but unfortunately it was way too cold outside and a lot of the stores are open front. You should visit this area during nice weather."
"You can feel a combination of traditional stuff and energy of the city. In my view,it is more attractive than Myeongdong",I found a restaurant with a reasonable price but good Korean food in an alley wiithin Insadong. It was full of local people. 
The place for real Korean souveniers,"This is a nice neighborhood to shop for authentic Korean souveniers. It is not only visited by tourists, but also by a lot of locals. It is on walking distance from the Gyeongbokgung Palace."
A friendly shopping atmosphere!,You will find In- sadong a lovely place to visit if you like shopping Al fresco style. The streets are lined with little shops selling locally made products and dining places that will satisfy your palates. Bring a reusable shopping bag so you don't have to get all the plastic bags to put in your purchases. Happy shopping!
Food & Traditional Crafts,"Located within a short walk from Anguk Station, Exit #6, the streets of Insadong are filled with Korean traditional culture and crafts. If you are the type that fancies bringing a souvenir or two home, Insadong would be a place for you to shop at. Besides shops selling numerous traditional crafts, the streets of Insadong are lined with numerous dining places. On the main streets you have more of the commercial based casual dining and in the alleys you would be able to find a more traditional Korean meal setting, but be prepared as communication could be limited here. I got my way through ordering with my limited Korean and bits of finger pointing.All in all, Insadong is definitely a must go to place in Seoul, and if you are even a fan of K-Pop or Korean reality programmes, the cafe that Yonghwa and Seohyun is located there."
Great place to buy souvenirs - Must visit for tourist,"I really like how tourist friendly this place is. It is one of the places in Seoul where a tourist can travel to and not worry they will be ripped off. The prices in Isadong I believe are regulated. The vendors are friendly, helpful, souvenirs are well build, restaurants are generally clean and tasty! A must visit for tourist, plus remember to stop by a traditional tea house or restaurant for a local tea or cuisine."
"A Must in Seoul, Korea","It is a cultural Mecca for the Korean and foreign visitors alike. One may be instantly wary about its apparent commercialism: so many shops selling similar products, numberous restaurants and tea houses, shouting vendors and sales persons, etc. However, the very competition makes Insadong a place for everybody: There are restaurants in a whole price-scale, from cheap to expensive. If you are looking for a rather economical food or drink, do not hesitate to meander into small alleys which are full of hidden gems. They are proud to be there in the cultural Mecca, and the services are unfaillingly good to the cultural pilgrims like us. "
Must visit!,"Here are things that I really liked about Insadong:*varied food stalls. Really affordable! The red bean cakes are a must try!*fun to people watch. People from different cultures can be seen here shopping.*awesome workmanship. Ssamjigil Mall is located here, where a lot of handmade crafts can be bought.*cheaper souvenirs"
Great shopping haven,Our friend YS brought us here... we found Fusion a very nice Korean restaurant... but what was really great was the shopping bargains everywhere... Korean stores do not only sell bargain items... they also give out a lot of freebies... I love this place... It was worth visiting :-)
Cool street that makes tourist crap look good,Interesting street with lots of places to barter over tourist junk but also has a boutquey vibe.Can also buy some nicer tourist stuff like woodblock prints etc.Fun to wander up and down - we walked over after goin to the gyeongbokgung palace
"If you like traditional arts, this is the place.","I stayed in Banana Backpackers. Insadong is only a 10 minutes walking distance from Insadong. If you are a man interested in Korea cultural Arts ,this is the place you should visit. I even saw a western street musician playing violin on the street. It was about 7 O'clock at night, and it was cold."
Nice,"Lots of people - tourist of course, me inclusive. A place for tourist just like Hefang street in Hangzhou, China. They have a lot of restaurants and tea houses. Artistic souvenirs like old mask, pottery and local arts. A sprinkle of shops selling I love korea t-shirts and knick knack souvenirs too. Lots of local snacks. There's this nice lady wearing traditional Korean costume selling nuts and snacks. Look great! They have this funny loooong cone for ice cream. Funny! Had lunch at one of the many restaurants in the area. Good food and inexpensive. Exterior of restaurant was made to look like traditional old style. Didn.t finish exploring cause we have another appointment. Will certainly visit this place the next time I come to Seoul. Visited in December 2012"
Great to visit and pick some local stuff,It was a good experience browsing through stuff especially some the handmade craft and I would recommend to someone who does not have much time to go around other places. There was a large store at a crossing which had good souvenirs at prices that seemed reasonable. It is totally touristy. 
Classic Korean Heritage Shopping District,"Great place to take mothers, wives and female children to purchase lots of traditional crafts like scarves, fans, tea, perfumes, etc. Not a lot for mens."
Souvenir Haven ..,"Lots of souvenirs, pottery and artwork ... street food was abundant. Most of the souvenirs are fixed price and they wouldn't give us any discount. Look out for the lady who makes rice and nuts candy. She's dressed in a traditional hanbok, the candies she makes are amazingly delicious. There's another man who makes little round puffs filled with red bean and they're soooo good to eat when it's freezing cold. "
A good walk at night,Not the super crowded and exciting street. They have a lot of calligraphy and artsy stuff. Great for people who likes to have peaceful walk at night.
Disappointment,"I had high expectations for this place since I wanted to get to know more about Korean tradition. I was rather disappointed. I was expecting genuinly old streets and structures (like Rome, Paris or Beijing), not beautifully refurbished houses and stores that sell tourist items at high prices. Oh well, it did not work out for me. (Also it was freezing cold even for someone like me who is from Toronto!)"
Historical Shopping Street with Traditional Korean Restaurants,"This shopping street is filled with art galleries and traditional Korean restaurants. Shopping is nothing fantastic. I particularly like one of the Korean family restaurant (土房) along the main street. I ate at this restaurant twice during the same trip. There is a 3-storey Starbuck coffee in which you can find free wifi and clean restrooms. You may want to visit this street if this is your first trip to Seoul. Otherwise, you may give it a miss."
Lots of Tourist shops,"very crowded place, lots of tourist shops. many local young people visit this place also. But the things there are a bit expensive."
"Good, but Myeong-dong is better","If you're looking for shopping myeong-dong is better. Other people have mentioned the art here, and it is more artsy and cultural than myeong-dong. It's also quite small. The way it was talked up to me I thought it would be a huge area, but realistically it is one main street with a few off shoots."
Nice for shopping,"This area was good for shopping and the side streets have some very nice little places to eat or get delicious tea. Unfortunately, in the winter, many of the shops have their wares outside, so there was no way to warm up while shopping so we cut the trip short. Hope to go back when this cold spell is over. Don't miss the honey string vendors - cool show!"
Cultural shopping area plus great food,"It's no wonder that this area is full of tourists because this is where you'll find the best cultural crafts, plus the great and affordable eating places."
Definitely an artsy place!,Get your souvenirs here. Plenty of shops to choose from and a good range of variety. Lotsa of places for food too. There are handicrafts and handmade accessories on sale too. Need to spend a good few hours here. Ssamzagil houses good restaurants and local designer craft shops which you can venture into.
Well worth a visit,I liked the fact that a touristy place like this still attracts so many locals. The restaurants in the back alleys must be good!Ssamzagil is a good arts and crafts centre and worth exploring.
Traditional and Modern,"Great place to get high quality souvenirs, and eat a good meal. Definitely must visit the O Sulloc Tea Shop for samples and wander down the side alley to eat at one of the restaurants. Lots of art galleries, can definitely spend a leisurely day wandering."
Wear traditional Korean costumes (hanbok) at the Tourist Information Centre,"Insadong is a very touristy area - lots of tourists, lots of shops selling souvenirs. Many shops sell the same items, so you should survey a few shops before buying. The tea shops are very expensive here, so be sure to check out the menu and prices before you order anything!What I liked most about Insadong is the Tourist Information Center, almost at the edge of the Insadong area. Here; you can get information on tourist attractions, travelling in Korea, etc. The staff are very friendly.And.... you can put on the traditional Korean costume (hanbok) for free! We took photos around the little 'garden' outside. The friendly staff will advise you on how to put on the costume. There are a few colourful ones to choose from. "
Nice area to walk and soak in the culture of Korea,"It's nice to see how mochi is being made on the street of Insadong, watch some street performance and shop for souvenirs and stuff here. Even bought an earthenware item that I didn't think I could find!!"
"Strolling, food trip, shopping and souvenirs!","Don't miss Insadong for the souvenirs. And don't forget to bargain for a cheaper price, some will give you discount if you'll buy more than one. The quality of the handcraft stuffs here are really nice. There are mini stalls along the sidewalk that are very intresting."
Loved Insadong!,"I just loved Insadong. Beautiful art and crafts and there is a fantastic art-oriented shopping centre as well which winds up and up to a beautiful rooftop vista. It really is quite nice, and restaurants everywhere! Insadong is definitely a must-visit when in Seoul. "
Shopping and food together,"If you are looking for small things to bring back for friend and family, than this is one of the places you can come to find. Lots of restaurants as well, along the side alley so you got to walk into them. Several shops selling tea and their accessories.There is also a couple of ""shopping malls"", rather a 4-5 storey high building with small shops selling several items.A good time is that it is across from the Buchon Hanook Village. If you are staying there to experience the traditional Korea homes, than this place is just walking distance away."
Good food along this street,"Found 3 places with good food: Dumplings, pork ribs & rice crackers. The shopping street is really interesting with hidden art galleries."
Very crowded,"This market was too crowded with turists, and also the prices seem to be adapted mainly to Japanese turists. There are some nice pottery and art shops, but we found nothing that was worth buying at the price. The side streets, very narrow and full of restaurants are very interesting"
A great place to be for food and shopping for things Korean,"For this trip to Seoul, I went to Insadong only for dinner and to find some good Korean green tea to bring back. My Korean friends brought me into this shop called ""OSULLOC"" - just perfert for what I was looking for. At Osulloc, I found organic roasted green tea from Jeju! "
Looking for souvenirs?,Insadong is the best place to buy souvenirs where hundreds of shop offer a great price for a wide variety of products.
Insight into Insadong,"Don't miss this buzzing, beautiful district full of boutiques, arts 'n' crafts, ceramics dealers, antiques shops, great little restaurants and the famous tearooms ... plus wonderful street traders selling exotic foods, including the best sweet dumplings ever !"
Touristy,Got to go to Insadong if you are in Seoul even though it is a street for tourists. Many interesting little shops to see and the best buy is the Korean Celedon Tea Cups.
Busy in the day and Quiet when night fall.,"The entire street bustle in activities from 10 am until about 6. Crowds start to disperse as most shops, galleries awould have closed by 8.30 pm. But tucked away in many of the branched out lanes, the restaurants and tea houses are in full swing. There are many restaurants serving Korean food and really you be spoilt of choices."
A place you can't miss!!,"The first time for me in Korea and I was visiting in Insadong three days in row.This place was an awesome place for the tourist and both sides of Insadong street are lined with many shops are selling traditional Korean craft work and souvenir.If you want to get yourself an authentic traditional Korean outfit ,HANBOK and you can feel the real Korea atmosphere as it is a nice and unique area!"
"Galleries, shopping and some cute eating places","This little street area is nice for a stroll, there are a number of galleries, heaps of shopping (although most souvieners will be slightly dearer than more local markets), but well worth a wonder and stop for some street snacks."
good street food,"Go at night and walk around the area to look at the stores, the food, the people and the history. Even Starbucks has its name in Korean to keep with the history of the area"
"A top area to stay, shop and eat in Seoul.","Insadong is a beautiful area to stay, and where I stayed at The Fraser Suites. When looking for an area and hotel to stay at, including the Myeongdong, Gangnam, Yeouido, and Itaewon areas, I chose Insadong and I was very happy with this decision. It is near 3 different subway lines, 1, 3 and 5. It borders on Jongno ro, and Jongno 2 streets, where there is lots of entertainment, restaurants and shopping, but tucked away just a block or 2 and giving you some bit of peace and quiet. Insadong gil, however which runs right thru this area, is filled with cosmetic shops, bars, restaurants and shopping and vendors. At night after 6:00 when work is finished the street comes alive with street performances and diners looking for a bite to eat. Try the waffles from one of the vendors or home made honey candies. Watch them make it while you wait (along with many others too). The Crown Bakery at the end of Insadong-gil is a favorite also. Tapgol Park is at the other end and a respite from the busy area. The Buddhish Temple, Jogyesa, is just off the Insadong area also and the palaces are walking distance away. Bukchon Hanok Village near by also. A great place to visit, eat, and even a better place to stay as everything is within walking distance. I will stay here again and recommend this area to others. "
Great Street Shopping,"A little touristy, but lots of friendly locals seem to also enjoy a weekend stroll in this area. Lots of great restaurants to be found in the side alleys."
Nice place to look for souvenirs,"Lots of shops, which sell souvenirs to tourists. In this street, no english sign (even ""Starbucks"" is written in Korean), but in the shops, it's easy to find someone who speaks english. Lots of cute and cheap souvenirs ! "
Great shopping experience,"I stayed at Fraser Suites so Insadong is a natural choice for my first stop. It is an attraction not to be missed! In my opinion, Insadong is a great showcase of Korea's tea / coffee culture and it gives shopaholics a good run for their money. Do pop by Miss Lee's Cafe to experience eating out of a metal lunchbox. Apparently, the cafe was made famous as it was a venue used during a Korean drama. At the end of the walk in Insadong, you would pass by Jongye Temple. I would think it is the only temple within the city area and makes for a good visit."
Insadong,Nice place to visit if you are looking for souvenirs.There are also baseball cages there.1000won for a few balls and you can try hitting it with the bat.Fun experience!!
"Nice place to stroll, have tea and buy souvenir","I went on a rainy day, and get a different feel of the place. It's actually quite romantic to stroll in the rain along Insadong. Bought souvenirs for friends and had quince tea along this small alley. It's good to explore the small alleys too, as they have some old looking tea shop with nice ambience. Don't miss the 2nd floor of those shop houses too. I found a toy museum and it's pretty interesting even tho it's small. You can also find some busker along the street if you're lucky. So rain, autumn, and busker on the violin makes a really romantic feel of this touristy place. If you are a vintage lover, you could spend half a day at least to explore this place with ease."
lovely place to stroll,Stayed on the next road but walked daily on this street. It has been commented that it is touristy but I loved it. Everyday I found something new to see or eat. 
Shopping,"This is a very good place for tourist. The shops sell good touristsy stuff. When your legs get tired, there are scores of coffee places for a nice cuppa and rest.. including Starbucks."
Great place to get a concentration of traditional Korean arts and culture,"Insadong is a great, clean place to get a good concentration of arts and culture, mostly in the form of little shops selling arts and cultural items, like traditional clothes, traditionally made papers, masks, basic musical instruments, souvenirs, etc. There are also art galleries, tea gardens, and some really nice, very traditional feeling restaurants. Some of the best spots are not on the main street, but in the back alleys. It's really cool to just wander around there, not just on the main street. Some folks may feel that it's become too commercial of a place. It does show signs of commercialization, but it still has a good amount of it that feels very traditional and rustic. You can also catch excellent performances of traditional Korean music, like samulnori drumming, pansori, and women singing and playing kayagum."
Great neighborhood for shopping and food,"We stumbled on this neighborhood by accident but loved all the local shopping, for both souvenirs and sampling of local shops. Look for the traditional Korean sweet sellers (making a honey and nut sweet;they will be vocal and demonstrating in English). Also a great area for variety of foods, Korean, vegetarian, noodles etc. "
More to offer in range of shopping at Insadong,"Tired of cookie cutter shopping malls,I found Insadong a breath of fresh air. There are lots of unique Korean-made souvenirs to be bought here."
My kind of street !,"I enjoyed an entire day here, wandering up and down the long line of shops, galleries and restaurants. My most memorable time was spent inside a specific tea shop, gloriously decorated with fresh plants and flowers, with exotic teas of all kinds, involving the traditional Korean tea ceremony."
Good place for shoping traditional korean stuff,You will find in this street a lots of traditional kroean stuff and tons of foreigners. Also you can find a bunch of good restaurants in here. The things to look for are in specialized small shops on the street and not in a big shoping center.
Good ambience and great for souvenirs,"Nice part of Seoul, lots of souvenir shops and cosy restaurants. Some nice art galleries and a nice street to walk in. It is not big, maybe a few hundred meters, nice to take a walk and have some food. There is an information office in Insadong. They also have some guesthouses and good hotels. Close to subway exit Anguk."
Colorful and lively street.,Love the atmosphere.the street performance and the drum performance by the cultural group help to create an fiesta atmosphere.local restaurants and cheap souveniers.
Nice place,Very touristy area in Seoul just like in Myeongdong so can get very crowded. There are tons of shops everywhere and many traditional goods. Even the shops' name are written in Hangeul.
Oldie art street of Seoul,"Insadong is the place for souvenirs shopping with the smell of oldie art on street but also some modern buildings, I love how they mixed on the street. Also some nice restaurants and food stalls that you must try."
A long forgotten era,Its a place where traditional korean arts still thrive.You can buy goods here not normally found in Malls and Supermarkets
One Stop Souvenir Shopping,"Insadong is your one stop shopping street for all your souvenirs and endless interesting finds. I would suggest you walk the whole strip first before making your purchases so you'll have an idea what they have in store for you. My favorite is Arirang Souvenir shop. I would also recommend buying Kkultarae or dragon beard candy made of 16,000 strands of pulled honey. You can watch the vendors making them and it's amazing how they come up with the strands. Also in Insadong, check out Ssamziegil, it's a building with small artsy shops selling knick knacks by local artists. Be on the lookout for guides in red clothes and hat for information or map of the area, if you find yourself getting lost - they can speak English."
a peak into the old,"This is where you go to get the traditional food, knick knacks, teas, and tea pots. There are plenty of shops. Make sure you talk to the shop owners about tea and various items they sell that you may know recognize. it's a neat little strip of shopping. Plus the restaurants in the area are old traditional hanoks and is a great experience for foreigners. (if you can sit on the floor)"
Shopping for gifts for the return trip home,"My week in Seoul was so busy that I had not thought about buying gifts until the day before I was to leave. This area was so varied that I was able to purchase items for all of the people on my list from my Mom to my grandchildren. Be sure to have plenty of time to stroll around, go into the shops, and experience all of the different kinds of stores. I loved looking in the shops with the myriad variety of beautiful papers and paint brushes. The shops with older items was fascinating. Some of the fashions were very beautiful, especially the traditional clothing. I ended up finding some great scarves for my Mom, some great jerseys for my grandsons, and some cool K-Pop stuff for my granddaughters. There are also a wide variety of places to eat, watch candy and rice cakes being made, and other just all around entertainment."
Lotsa Hand-made Knick Knacks to buy,"U'll be spoilt for choices if U're looking for souvenirs. For the teenagers, there are shops selling Korean idol Posters/Calendars/File folders etc. For the Tea-lovers, there's O'sulloc. For the pretties, there are really cheap scarves. Suggest U check out the nearby Samcheong-dong after this. Look out for Guides in Red Jackets on the streets. They'll be able to point U in the direction of Samcheong-dong. Walk from Insadong, cos' a lot of interesting shops & Exquisite cafes along the way."
Tourist spot,"Lots of small gifts shops, restaurants. Nice to stroll along the streets and take some photos. Things ere abit pricey compare to downtown. Most shops and restaurants will close after 9pm "
Great mixed shopping/food,"This is an interesting mix of shopping, from upper scale items, small private stores, to trinkets and antiques (or are they?). The street food vendors were plentiful and delicious, and one can spend hours browsing here. For new, fashion and electronics, stick to the Tower area and malls, but for unique and different along with quant, Insadong is one of may places, but probably the best."
Its like a small market street specially for tourist,Its a small market street selling some food items antiques books souveniours etc. They say the setting is like a traditional market of korea.. But in reality i dont think so. It doesnt give that traditional or bound to culture feel.There is also a park across the street. It also not a big park and in afternoon a lot of retired people were seating there and almost no activity.Anyways near the insadong street there is also a tourist info centre and subway train station so you can also get your way out and go to near by attractions.
first place we visit in Seoul,"Every time we go to Seoul we go to this area first. It has been commercialized over the past 15 years but still retains a bit of it's charm. Nice to see that they finally made the main street a pedestrian only section during peak hours. We always look for a hogwan (budget hotel) in the area and stay there for a night. We found one that charged 40,000 won for a room with a bed and it was perfect. We checked the web for rooms in and around downtown Seoul and most were wanting over 200,000 for what we in the USA would equate to a Comfort Inn or Best Western. The room was small, but the bed was soft and the room was clean. Make sure you check around a couple places before committing and haggle on the price with the owner. The food options and prices are great if you want to try good Korean food. The area is very safe and is quiet after about 11 or so. Keep in mind that breakfast, in the American sense does not exist for Korean restaurants. You will have to settle on pastry at the Crown Bakery unless you can wait until around 10:30/11am and eat the same stuff you would see on a lunch or dinner menu. Great location to stay if you plan to visit a couple of the palaces and the downtown shopping areas. My wife is a Korean citizen and she loves the area for it's art galleries and ceramic shops."
"Higher quality items, higher prices.","When shopping, it helps to know the merchandise and going retail value. Traditional Korean items can sell here for twice the prices elsewhere. If you are looking for toys for children's gifts, head over to Namdaemun Free Market. If you are looking for art, higher fashion clothes and jewelry, and antique artifacts, this is the easiest place to find them. Higher quality ""hanbok"" (traditional dress) can be found here."
Insadong - one of the top 10 destinations in Seoul.,"The neighborhood of Insadong with it quint shops and tea houses is a wodelful place to spend a quite afternoon strolling through the narrow streets mostly void of vehicular traffic. If you want to get yourself an authentic Hambok, the traditional Korean outfit, Insadong is the place to go. Many sourvenir shops line the streets and alleys catering to every budget or desire. I especially like the gold fillament book marks and other cell phone accesories as gifts for family and friends of all ages. Do stop by one of the traditional tea houses tucked into the old fashioned houses reminescent of days gone by in Korea and sip on some traditional or contemporary flavors with not so sweet Korea ""sweets"" or rice cake to go with your tea. Must see as one of the top ten attractions in Seoul."
where old meets new..,"It is a must to visit in Korea. A great place to buy gift and to try Korean food. I have often visited DaWon, a Tea Cafe inside GyeongIn Art Gallery. There a many hidden gems inside narrow alleys of Insadong."
Something different,"If you like to get your hands on hand crafted Korean stuff then head to Insadong. Samzeigil is charming and easy to navigate , the shops there offer various items depending on your fancy. I like that there a lot of choices in the area, a bit pricey than Namdameun , but you can't see those items in Insadong at Namdaemun. I also like that the road has access to Jogyesa temple. Worth the visit. "
Insadong Antiques,Most things here are repro. We often sell to Korean dealers in the UK - things here are 10 times the price.
Souvenirs heaven,You can spot alot of cheap souvenirs here! You can even bargain if you buy more. But it subjected to the seller whether they are willing to give you discount. I think it will be better that you survey for the price first along the street before you make any purchase.
"Very interesting, fun","We visited this street every day during our visit to Seoul. We bought gifts for the whole family from here. The art galleries are interesting, as are the shops that sell calligraphy. Dont miss taking a tea break in OSulloc tea shop, it is a unique place. The side streets lead to antique shops and other interesting places. Street carts sell different foods (including silk worms which we photographed after asking for permission). Overall highly recommended."
Shop till you drop,Lots of shops and stalls to spend your money on but the food carts had my attention the most. I only visited the souvenir shops and the prices were reasonable so there was no need to haggle with the vendors. It gets crowded here so come early if you don't like a crowd. 
Always lively and intersting but getting more commercia,"Insa-dong is a lively short stretch that has been the center of crafts, arts and tourist shops for some time. It remains a worthwhile area to visit, stroll around, see interesting things but antike stores and galleries are few now making place for Korean designer stores - and more and more tourist style craft stores."
Shopping!,Some really interesting stalls. The restaurant we ate at was well priced and it tasted good. The funnest are the string candy guys. They are very sharp and do little shows in Korean and English. If you looking for pressies for family or friends then this is the place to go! Happy shopping people.
Art~,"a walking and shopping street that you won't need to give way for car passed by,the government has make this a walking street and it is safe to walk.for those who like to have something fancy and the one and only accessories,you may go to ssamjiegil but the price could be slightly higher as it is special one.a good place that for those who like to buy souvenirs."
So sweet,"Apart from the souvenirs, the street also has many food stands: a great opportunity to try some local sweets. You might also catch a live performance in one of the side streets, and there might be local artists advertising their shows."
Nice place,"Insadong is one of the most popular areas of Seoul with tourists. There are plenty of souvenirs of various types, some clothes and other shopping, food, inc street food, art and probably the best area of Seoul for buying gifts to take back home.Insadong isn't one of the neon lit areas of Seoul, it has more heart and character. I recommend anyone going to Seoul to take a walk in Insadong."
"In sadong, street of joy!","I've been to South Korea twice and never failed to go to this street. It has everything a tourist is looking for while traveling to Korea from souvenirs, bags, T shirts, and many other things since there's a mall alongside the street. You can go to the roof top and there are many art works placed on the roof top. The street is very clean and the people there are also friendly. If you're lucky you might get the chance to see art exhibitions along the way (if any)."
Insadong,"The heart of the old Seoul and center for artists and anything creative. Plenty of places to eat, good bakeries and many coffee shops. Easy access from Anguk station."
Traditional. Market for foreigners,"There are amazing handmade items to be found at this traditional market, however there are also items that have been shipped in from forien countries and being sold as korean souvieners. We return to this market every time we visit, as it is the best place to find traditional giftwear, food, and demonstrations all within the same area.....its a beautiful place!!"
charming shopping district,"what fun to find Insadong shopping area - so much to see and explore, definitely take some extra cash in case you see a once off deal or something unique to remind you of your Korean travels. Great day out!"
Pretty cool,"I enjoyed Insadong. I was worried it would be a bit 'too commercial' but it felt really nice. I went in the morning, walking through at about 1030 on a Saturday when things were just starting to wake up. I eyed the various souvenirs, ranging from the ""I (heart) Korea"" shirts to nice wooden carvings to mother-of-pearl jewelry boxes. Nice walk."
Fun area of town,"It was a small shopping street with old stores, beauty stores, and antiques. It was a great way to spend a lazy afternoon, but still get to see a lot of what Seoul has to offer."
Enjoyed it,"Good place to buy souvenirs for your visit to Korea. I would recommend to buy the Korean traditional dolls (with their colorful costumes). But frankly, every other product here is much pricier than the ones you find in other areas like Namdaemun or Dongdaemun or Myeongdong (same quality). I guess the extra bucks you spend here are for the English that the shopkeepers know :). Else, it is the same all over Korea (You ask them ""Olmayeyo"", they tell you some amount and you reply ""Ahh, Pissayo"", they reply ""Aaniyo..... blah blah"", you tell them ""kaka chuseyo"". More often than not, they decrease the amount by 1k or 2k won (max 5k) and you fight for that) :)On a serious note, Insadong is a ""can be visited"" place rather than being called a ""must be visited"" location......"
Insadong for shopping,"Great place to shop, with some better handicrafts and artisan shops than other places in Seoul. I bought some nice necklaces for my wife and daughters."
"Great food, fun to walk around","Lots of great restaurants just have to pick one that suits your taste. Also have the only Starbucks that's in Korean. There's a great restaurant that specializes in chicken which was yummy and it was part of our food tour. The cooking school Ongo which offers dinner and lunch food tours is also located there. There's a mall that has inclines heading up from floor to floor that offers boutique items, very neat. Nearby also has a lot of art museums which I didn't visit."
Very fun shopping experience,"Insadong is the perfect place to wander: the streets are pedestrian only, there's always something going on in the parks on either end, and the shops just call out for exploration. You can shop for just about anything; clothes, antiques, souvenirs, tea, celadon pottery, lithographs and fine art. The restaurants are excellent and so is the street food. "
Vibrant and traditional,"Vibrant series of pedestrianised streets tucked into the Palace district with beautiful antique stores where you can buy anything from pottery to drums, outdoor tea rooms, art galleries, clothes shops and every possible souvenir under the sun, Korean and otherwise- (we even bought kitsch 'Gangnam style' souvenir socks!). What I like about Insadong is that most of the items for sale are made in Korea and NOT in China.There are some fantastic Korean restaurants with wonderful food and are not too expensive (as well as some veggie restaurants too!). For those that don't want to eat Korean food in Insadong we ate at a wonderful Italian restaurant called Il Mare. The best Italian I have had in Korea and possibly elsewhere. Can find some really sweet little tea rooms off the beaten track with an array of teas from citron to five taste tea which can be drunk hot or cold."
"Vibrant and touristy, not the best place in town for bargin's","This is a fun place and probably a middle to near the top of the list place to visit if you will be in town for more than a few days. However, if you are on a tight schedule this could be skipped in favor of MyeongDong, or DongdaeMun as this is a much smaller palce than either of the others and anything you can fine here, you could find at the one of the other places and at a far better price. I found Insadong a charming little place but much pricer for the exact same Korean traditional art, antiques, and souvenirs that you will find in the larger shopping districts.If you do decide to shop here, be sure to compair prices at other shops before you make a purchace. You will find that many shops carry the exact same items at prices that can vary quite a bit from place to place.One other important tip regarding places to eat, there are several great little Korean eatery's in Insadong however, if you desire somthing non Korean you will likely starve here as there is really nothing else to be had in this corner of Seoul"
"Very little historic, very much tourist","Insadong should be a 'must'. By far not! It's just another tourist shopping street, with some scattered arty-fartsy. Which btw is very mediocrat. Although, in the middle is a tea-house/store with a long circular walkway up to the top floor which is nice. My advise; avoid it. There's so much more in Seoul worth visiting..."
"Interesting place, but seems to lack some non-Korean-lunch places","It is a nice pedestrian street with lots of art shops, galleries and so on. A little bit overrated in my point of view. If you're not into Korean food, there are not that many options. But, there is a nice lunch-cafÃ© called ""think coffee"" on the street west of the northern end of Insadong (in the palace direction)."
"Touristy, but then we were tourists","Vibrant street life, small shops, street food and restaurants... everything you might want to bargain for and take home as trinkets. Off in the side streets are (somewhat pricey) antique shops that deserve a look. We found that the real fun was ""people watching."" The stores, for the most part are specialized, for example, there's one for celadon, one for tea things, another few for women's fashions, and so forth. We enjoyed looking at the (probably mass-produced) Korean paintings for fans and wall art. The area is only a few blocks long, but what fun! The pavement is somewhat uneven, so I'm not sure if it's really wheelchair accessible, but we did see many older people navigating with canes.It's a ""must see; must do"" when in Seoul, and that's probably why all the tours stop there."
Best place for Art Lovers!,"I've been here quite a lot during our 8 days staying around Bukchon. Its just walking distance from our hanok to Insadong. Lots of art gallery! For travelers, they can buy souvenirs here, key chain, a pair of Korean Chopstick, t-shirt and etc were the best choice for bring back home. For someone who love k-pop, or k- drama,""We got married"" one of episode was filming here at one of the restaurant. It is also safe to walk around during night. Yes, street food is also good here.. Try Hotteok, you gonna love it!!"
Local Culture & Great Shopping for Korean items,"A lovely place to stroll through. Very interesting shops with an incredible amount of merchandise to choose from. It can be a very busy place depending on when you visit. The prices are excellent! You can buy antiques, art and Korean traditional merchandise. It is a very vibrant and interesting place with lots to see. If we ever go back to Seoul, Insadong will be on the top of the things to do again, but I would leave more of time to explore and enjoy this unique place. Do add this to your 'to do' list and you will have fun finding a bargain, tasting a local treat or just enjoying the atmosphere."
good food here,really liked the food streets tucked into the corners of this street..overall a very good shopping experience.
Shoppers delight,"This is a great pedestrian street for shopping and seeing some Korean cultural shows. The food on this street is also great and I highly recommend stopping for hoteok, a sweet pancake full of cinnamon sweet syrup...awesome!"
Lovely Insadong,"I loved Insadong so much, I spent 2 days there during my 7 day stay in Seoul. There is a lovely pedestrian street lined with art, craft, souvenir, food and fashion shops; and if you venture down the little laneways, you'll find restaurants with wonderful, authentic Korean fare. I would highly recommend a visit to Insadong during your stay in Seoul."
Worth a visit,"Picked up some lovely momentums of Korea here and you can bargain with the traders on what price you wish to pay. If they don't wish to bargain with you, they will say! Had a very short visit here as on business but would have loved to have stayed longer, as there are endless little shops, stalls and alleys to explore"
I like it,"Insadong, is the place where you could find anything traditional, traditional Korean gifts and souvenirs with low prices, take care you should argue for a better deal.Also you'll find there some cheap Korean food resturants"
Great place for old korea,A place to source for old korea from vendors peddling old wares from forgotten era. Look out for specialty shops offering unique antiques
Arty fatsy place,"It's full of cultural and artistic feel at this place. There's a traditional snack along the street which instantly melt in your mouth. Must try! Lots of souvenirs at cheaper prices than other places within Seoul.I like Samjjigil, a small mall selling artistic stuffs. A colorful place."
So much good stuff to buy,There was a lot of art and so much traditional Korean art that I wanted to buy everything. If you are looking for gifts to bring home to people I would definitely go here to get them.
"Fun, but nothing special",Insadong is a walking street full of souvenir shops. The walk was fine and there were fun stuff around it ( we saw a street performance that was fun). 
Tourist shopping,"A great place to get all those bits and pieces to take home. We bought most of our gifts here and visited the most exotic tea shop I have ever been in. A lovely place to stroll and you are not hassled. Remember to ask for a discount, it is expected."
"Lots to do, great shopping.","The street food here is great. The artisan atmosphere is refreshing. The souvenirs are varied and the prices are decent. And there are many art galleries, performers and nooks and crannies to explore. Great restaurants too. I highly recommend getting your picture taken at one of the hanbok (Korean traditional dress) photo studios. It's such an original and fun souvenir. I do my Christmas shopping here every year. "
every tourist needs to be there ..,a great place to experience the korean traditions ...it's located within walking distance of the palace ..
Must do,Area with lots to see. Shops were different and interesting. Great atmosphere. Ideal for a leisurely stroll. 
great place to buy souvenirs,"great to look for gifts, lots of small gift shops... price are reasonable... lots of little food snacks and restaurants along the street..."
Shopping for Tourists,"Our tour guide told us she was taking us to the ""tourist shopping area"" and we were not disappointed. We picked up lots of little gifts and enjoyed walking through the streets and sampling street fare. A fun afternoon."
Good place for souvenirs and food,"This area is a series of streets lines with shops of all kinds. We were there on the weekend, and it was fairly busy and we heard it can get packed with people. We saw a lot of traditional Korean art and craft items such as artwork, pottery and paper crafts. There is not any sort of name brand goods like at a mall. The prices were a little bit higher than what we saw in areas oitside of Seoul, but you can always negotiate with the vendors. The types of stores ranged from nice high quality goods, down to junky tourist trinkets. Also, there are a good selection of food vendors on the street. Overall, aneorthwhile place to see for a few hours."
a little of everything,This is a place you can go to snoop around in shops for actual real things cultural or trinkets to give your friends. Not expensive but sometimes a little cheesy. For the most part well worth the visit.
Best shopping in Seoul,"Insadong has a little bit of everything. Fine art (painting, wood, fabric, pottery), handmade items of all kinds, touristy souvenirs so you can buy gifts for a wide variety of tastes. Also great food and a moving exhibit on North Korea. All in one shopping district."
a very nice place,"Insadong is one of must-visit places in seoul. You can buy kinds of souvenir here, though some of them are more expensive compared to namdaemun.and there are so many korean style food stalls along the street. I came here at night and didnt have dinner at restaurant, cuz I stopped by almost every hawker stall there lol."
"definitely somewhat touristy, but great street food, great shopping, and amazing traditional tea houses","In case you're not aware, Insadong is the market that's supposed to be famous for it's traditional tea houses as well as being the market to visit if you're looking for traditional Korean celadon pottery, or art galleries, among other things. It definitely has more art galleries than I've seen anywhere else, as well as lots of pottery shops and traditional calligraphy/art supply type little shops. Also, the place is slightly more touristy than some of the other Seoul markets, so you'll see more white people/foreigners here, and there are definitely more places selling the folding fans and small lacquered/inlaid jewelry boxes and other things I identify as trinkets intended to be sold to foreigners. That being said, the street food is amazing, and they also have a few shops where they sell traditional Korean candy/confections, and they have some really amazingly interesting displays where they take you through the process of making the candy right before your very eyes; this by itself, along with the food, is reason enough to go there. However, what made this our first choice of markets to visit was the promise of traditional Korean tea houses, and they are definitely not hard to find. The one we stopped in, name of which I can't remember, seemed to be prototypical: beautiful old style building, serene traditional environment, no shoes inside, everyone else obviously local/Korean national, and very expensive traditional style Korean tea drinks and related snacks, which from what I understand is normal. For example, one cup of red ginseng honey tea was 10,000 won, or a little less than $10, but it was very excellent and worth it to relax and enjoy such a uniquely foreign (to an American) environment. There were quite a few different places that all seemed to offer this type of experience, within the market.So. I highly recommend this market. Go there, eat some street food, top it off with some tea in a traditional setting, and buy some traditional Korean sweets and pottery and a lacquered and inlaid jewelry box as souvenirs to take back home. You won't be disappointed and this market is definitely not exactly like the others, so you probably need to see them all."
We Came for Souvenirs,"When we came to Insadong, we didn't think we'd be going shopping. But this place had a lot of shops that sell souvenirs and trinkets and the sort. From street food, to clothes, to art pieces. Interesting to see alot of tourists going around and locals selling and shopping. There is also a very good restaurant in the basement of Insa Art Gallery."
"Touristy, but great shopping","A pleasant walk and it is still possible to find some great traditional crafts for souvenirs, such as the Korean Craft and Design Foundation and the Myung Sin Dang Brush Store. There is also a handy information center at the intersection of Insadong and Yulgok-ro near the exit of the Anguk subway station. They can provide you with a map of the stores and point you towards the ones selling the items you want."
"For trinkets, local artistry and market food",This is my kind of market. All the little trinkets and local tapestries you can find are here. I find this more interesting than fashion wares that the Koreans are well known for. And to walk through just to experience the street food is good enough. Finish off your walk with a stroll through the Pagoda Park to see the 2nd national treasure of Korea. 
Great place to look for local food and souvenirs,There were home style restaurants which served authentic Korean delicacies. Also had stalls selling local snacks which were addictive! Souvenir shops and shops selling artsy stuff were plenty. No real bargaining but the ahjumas were willing to give you discount if you are really interested to buy from them.
One of the best places to while away your time in Seoul,"To me, Insadong - though a bit touristy - is one of the best places to visit in Seoul, a city that is somewhat attraction-challenged. It is a very artsy place with wonderful art galleries, nice cafes and quaint artists. There are also decent restaurants in Insadong as well as in the vicinity. Visit on Sundays when the streets are strictly pedestrian-only. "
"A little touristy, but worth a visit","Okay maybe I was being a little vague on that, but this is probably a huge tourist area selling almost every souvenir you can think of. Though the pottery and art is worth a look."
Street with souvenirs with very high price,"It should be interesting, but it's not. Very crowed street with very expensive souvenirs like a child t-short for 20$. Yes, you could see a lot of antiques shops, and Korean restaurants, but, that's it. "
lots of things to see ... & buy ...,There are so many interesting things to see here as a tourist. Walk off the main street into the many side lanes to explore ...
"Arts and culture area, centrally located","It serves varieties of choices from arts, paintings, shopping areas, good mixture of cuisines. Popular among tourists. "
a good place to buy souvenirs,i went to insadong and this area is outdoor that sell a lot of unique and souvenirs products. quite fun to shop in here as well because they have a lot of korean rests in this area.
Good area for window shopping,"Insadong is an area for traditional Korean hand crafts. It is not cheap, but you can certainly find some really interesting traditional type souvenirs here. There are some nice restaurants and tea shops (and a Starbucks) so it is a great area to wander around in, even if you are just window shopping. In the evenings and on weekends there are also street vendors with very tasty Korean street food (safe - I've eaten tons of it and had no problems. I highly recommend it!) and also some less expensive handcrafts. I can usually find a few cute pairs of earrings or a nice scarf or two for 4000 won or less (about $3 US). If something seems expensive, try another store or street cart. Many of them have the same items and you can usually find one guy who is selling cheaper than the others."
This Street Rocks,"We stayed at the nearby Cats Hotel to be in the Insadong area with its temples, parks, palaces and the most unbelievable collection of alley ways and warrens filled with shops and restaurants of all types. We even had the good fortune to witness some sort of public demonstration that according to the tourist center had something to do with architecture. It would take days to explore this place and we ate numerous meals and shopped there, too. Its reputation as a fun and interesting place is well deserved. At night, it only gets busier, so the action is nearly around the clock."
Insadong- Ssamzie,After 11am where shopping strip closed off to traffic.They sell things that is designed by their local designer. Some of the items sold are even limited quantity. 
Lively street!,Enjoyed watching the people and seeing the different products for sale. many of the stores have very similar products so it is worth shopping around a little to get the best prices
perfect for tourists but still pleasant,"I spent 2 weeks staying in various areas in Seoul and only a couple of hours in Insadong. I did not stay close and mostly went there on one day for a particular restaurant. it is probably a tourist magnet but handles it very well with that mix of art and craft and small shops and restaurants and not too much tourist tack (go to Itaewon for that!). Not really a destination as such for me anyway, but quite pleasant for a general wander and a mix of sights and sounds."
Great place to swag and souvenirs,"This is an area in Seoul to buy antiques, and other souvenirs made by Korean crafts people. You can also find the typical touristy stuff as well. Lots of shops, and they try really hard to communicate with you when you are in the shop. Can be a little pushy if you are not with a local."
All you can get under one roof,"Another place where you can get anything you want in one area. Fashion, food and entertainment in one place."
Fun place to explore,"Insadong is a place to visit on your trip to Korea. There are many shops, tea houses and places to eat. There is a main road to walk down, but be sure to wander into the alleys and upstairs or you will miss a lot. Souvenirs galore here, place to find Korean Hanbok type purses. Try some of the street vendor food as you walk down the street."
Place for Art and culture lovers,"We went in a restaurant at one of the small streets off the main one, quite expensive, but big portions.There's alot of tea houses, went in O sulloc coz of guidebooks recommendations. The teas n desserts at the 2nd floor were nice, but pricey.Expensive specialised shops selling handmade crafts along the streets.There's a Road Street Bar takeout cocktail at the end, which is worth a try too. The drinks come in transparent packets with a straw. Alcohol content wasn't high and taste quite nice. Cute young bartender guy too ^-^ "
"Tourist trap for sure, but worth a visit","Come for the shopping, the snacks and the food. The souvenirs are gaudy and not appealing at all, but there are hidden antique shops with gorgeous, but pricey items. The food options are affordable and tasty. Come check this tourist strip out."
Food. Shopping. Art and Culture,It has them all in one place! This is the place to get souvenirs. It is much cheaper than the same items being sold in the museum gift shops. It carries all the latest and cutest fashion items to tea shops with teawares. Lots of galleries and small studio for the young artists. 
The Soho of Seoul?,"Small (predominantly) pedestrian street dotted with awesome designer shops, art stores, and traditional sweet stalls. Some of the buildings had superbly designed facades. Has some great bars too (overlooking the street) so great for beer, conversation and people-watching. "
Many nice small restaurant and small shops,"great place to eat and shop for souvenirs. the area is not so big, make sure you go into the small alleys, there many beautiful small restaurants hidden there. "
"Great place for arts, traditional tea house","Insadong is a lovely area full of arts gallery, studios, traditional tea houses and restaurants and numerous souvenir shops.. I enjoyed the traditional street foods there.. Things are more expensive here.. Better price for similar souvenir in Namdaemun market.."
"Always crowded but a ""must go"" if you are in Seoul","Insadong is always crowded with tourists and locals, but you will miss out a nice spot if you skip this.Be aware that the souvenirs are just - souvenirs, shops with cheap trinkets and memorablia are targeting the younger tourists (tourist trap!) but there are a few gems like the handcrafted masks, custom paintings and antique bookstore in the main street (but they have their price of course).I recommend the restaurant Guzip / 인사동 그집 if you are there, it's right beside the famous art street Ssamzigil where you can find handcrafted artwork.If you wander a bit outside of the ""tourist"" Insadong (right side across the street where the coffee shop A Twosome Place is) you will get to see lots of small galleries and nice restaurants too."
Souvenir Shops,"Insadong is an Artist haven...quite a number studios and exhibits in the area. One of a kind handmade unique jewelry pieces can also be found here. Stores are very foreigner friendly. Asking for discounts is quite common and more often, stores will bargain with you. Restaurants also flourish the area mostly found on the side streets. A small park were senior citizens gather can also be visited."
"It's a shopping arcade, so what?","Everywhere I go in Korea is a shopping arcade and Insadong is one of them, but the ambiance is traditional shopping arcade.I didn't buy anything here since the price is way expensive, but for strolling around and see the products probably it's fine. If you're looking for traditional korean stuffs and souvenirs, i recommend Namdaemun market. They sell everything cheaper than Insadong.Oh yeah, I suggest not to bargain much in Seoul or the seller will be angry at you. Perhaps 3000won is already the biggest bargain. And don't touch anything if you're not reconsidering to buy anything from the first place. The seller will kinda force you to buy or get angry at you.There's a mall called Ssamziegil inside Insadong. I recommend you to go to this place and stroll around, having a tea break in a cafe on the rooftop, and go to a print club machine shop. The print club shop in on the second floor and provides you with a traditional costume rental for free if you're taking a picture here."
Good place to explore,This might be one of the more interesting places to explore in Seoul as a tourist. We came here with a friend of mine who is an academic at one of the local universities. His English is very good so we had a readily available tour guide. This was helpful but not essential if you have no such person upon whom to call. We found the shops to be varied and interesting and there are several good restaurants from which to choose if you want a bite. The atmosphere is a little different from other parts of Seoul as this area has a bit cozier and more retro feel. It is worth taking some time to explore if you are in Seoul with some leisure time available.
Shopping Treat,"Enjoyable area with shops and vendors. Many artistic offerings as well as Korean handicrafts and souvenirs, both inexpensive and higher priced. Deigner shops and wonderful show shops. Lots of places to sit and relax - have tea or a snack."
Very touristy...,"But if you are by yourself and don't read Korean, you will find places here to eat that have English menus for real Korean food. Or just go up and down and taste the local delights. I was lucky enough to catch a taekwando festival type thing going on and a free concert as well."
Souveners Galore,"This is the place to buy your gifts for family and friends. One of my favourite shops was a pottery store. It was filled with delicate tea pots, bowls, cups and candle holders. Don't be afraid to bargain at some of the smaller stores. There are also a great variety of food places down the ally ways off the main street. "
A must,"Insadong is a great place to see traditional Korean art, souvenirs, and crafts. The street is constantly packed with people, foreigners and Koreans alike, shopping or just looking around. If you are looking for souvenirs for yourself or others, this is the place to go. There are many shops and they do all have a lot of the same things, haggling is acceptable and recommend. You will be able to widdle the price down at some places. There is also some great street food to try. You will be able to tell the popular ones with the long lines. The chicken on a stick is delicious so are the many many pastries to try. Be sure to allow plenty of time for all the shops and food. "
Relaxing stroll in Seoul,"Insa-dong is located between two subway lines so it's easy to get to if one knows to ride the Seoul metro. It's within walking distance to Changdaeokgung Palace and the Bukchon Village. Stone paved roads line the streets with small shops from gifts, art, eatery, to some traditional Korean crafts. No pressure like the rest of Seoul. Just a very relaxing stroll. I felt like I was in europe or carmel (california) with the exception of more vibrant Korean color and theme. This is not an attraction just to tourists, but popular among young local koreans as well. Seeing young Korean people strolling on the street of Insa-dong hand in hand, one forgets the hush and buzz of the city. A great place to relax and recharge for the next tour. Most of the street are one story, with the exception of a small two story structure, and a few shops.If you want an action packed shopping experience, Insa-dong may not be right. But if you are interested in art and have extra time in Seoul, check this place out and spend an hour to relax here."
Traditional but stylish,Cool place where you can find both traditional and contemporary stuff.
"Very pleasant, if touristy","Lovely spot for a stroll, with lots of souvenir shops, restaurants, etc, as well as arts and crafts places. Probably a bit over-priced, but pleasant nonetheless. Easily accessible by subway and also by the Seoul City Tour Bus (hop on hop off). Stroll up and down the side streets, not just the main street."
Souvenir shopping,"This was great, though expensive! This was one of the few places in Seoul that I felt was CLEAN, which was very refreshing to find. There are a bunch of shops along the walk selling very typical Korean souvenirs, and in particular those that are traditional Korean and of Choson culture. Chopticks, wall hangings, fans, Korean dolls, silk bags/make-up bags/wallets, etc. etc. All fun shopping and a good time, though expensive because the people who shop there are clearly foreigners. They also sold more contemporary stuff like Big Bang/kpop calendars and whatnot."
So much to see,"I love to see different cultures, and cuisine. Insadong is full of both. I tried some very odd dishes and delicacies..all of which got a big tick of approval from me. Insadong is full of people, very busy, loads of shops, little cafes, and alleyways where you can easily get lost, as the distraction of weird and wonderful things in the shop windows get your attention. I liked Insadong, and in my 2 day stop over in Seoul, I came here twice to take it all in."
Plenty of shopping and street dining,"I can't compre to other markets in Seoul, because I didn't have time to get to any, but spent hours here. Need a leather purse, this is the place. Need cheapo souvenirs, you'll find them here. And kkultarae candy barkers, and beautiful handmade products and teas and papers and calligraphy brushes and...Favorite purchase, home made ""chops"" stamps with names in Korean from 30,000 won on the street and in shops. Be sure to wander Ssamzgil (sp?) - a four story center along the street.Have fun!"
Fun shopping and lots of hype,"It's a tourist and artist street. Even the traditional cookie makers and ice cream vendors perform. Once you resign yourself to that, let loose and enjoy the shopping. Some places were overpriced, and off on side streets one could get better prices and find more interesting artists, for which I did not mind paying more for. The work was incredible. Food was priced ridiculously high. I recommend shopping and then going somewhere else to eat."
Shopping and entertainment,A more interesting shopping street than the Itaewon area - more Korean design and craft. Watch out for the entertaining purveyors of carved seals and Court honey/nut food and try adventuring down an alley for local food.
"So much see, so much to buy!","Loved the variety of color, the many goods available, the throngs of people. We went to a great tea house there too."
Nice street,"In this street you'll find a lot of souvenir stores and tea and great tea stores.Most of the souvenir stores sell the same stuff, but I'm shure you'll find the perfect one."
A very enjoyable stroll,"This a very nice area lined with small shops for souvenirs, coffee shops and some nice restaurants. Five minute walk from a metro station. Strangely enough I did not see many currency exchange shops or banks around the area, so change before you go there if necessary."
Fascinating pedestrian area,"There are so many interesting tea houses and shops in this area, that I went back a second time during my 4 days in Seoul. As an artist, I was particularly attracted to the paper goods and pottery."
"Full of Character, Shops & Great Eateries","Wow,shoppers and bargain hunters, this is paradise! An absolutely breathtaking area we thought and happened to be staying just around the corner. Endless shops selling everything you could imagine from the lower priced touristy stuff to the upper end of high fashion, gorgeous clothes, shoes, jewellery, leather work. Beautiful linen clothing. Restaurants everywhere with unreal cheap food and little tea houses tucked away up alley ways ~ they were awesome and the variety of teas! Loved this area and hardly strayed from it. Definitely going back!"
"good place to visit, eat and drink",I loved the fusion restaurant in old house with garden and the tea place with gallery nearby too.
Funky Artsy area with some great little shops and restaurants...,What a lovely artsy district! I got engaged in an amazing Italian restaurant hidden in one of the alleys. Last time I was here was in 2008 but I am sure it is still definitely worth a visit! Take time to get a portrait sketched by one of the artists. 
full of life!,"Insa dong is a great place to shop and eat ice creams :) the place is full with locals and tourists, and there are a lot of things to see there, culturally."
Quaint little suburb rich in the arts,"We visited Insadong for an afternoon on an icy Korean day. We walked into the main Insadong area through narrow alleys of quaint homes and small restaurants of all times including little coffee shops and vegetarian restaurants. Architecture was mostly traditional and wooden, which gives a cosy feeling. One eventually reaches what can probably only be described as a ""tiny mall built along a five storey ramp"". This place is packed with tiny shops that sells curios, tourist clothing, shoes, ornaments etc. All the products are interesting to look at, often unique, often of good quality or hand made and expensive. You stroll up the wooden ramp browsing shops and perhaps even having a coffee or waffle. Be warned, as interesting as the shops may be, photos of the shops and their products are either strictly prohibited by the owners are charged for at an exhorbitant rate.After the mall, you proceed to the ""main road"" in Insadong which is flanked buy larger shops that sell everything from clothing, curios, art and jewellery to traditional food products. All shops are interesting and the place certainly tries to capture the Korean traditions. For the tradition, great architecture, interesting products, cosy feeling on a winters day and brilliant people we met in Insadong, I certainly give it 4 stars and is a must see if you are in Seoul."
Lovely area a bit touristy!,We walked up to Insa-dong easy walk and safe. We liked the area and we're impressed with the fact that we weren't pestered to buy stuff. It is touristy in a not so overt way. Need to visit at least once.
"Wonderful restaurant, basic shopping","Most of the prices here were slightly higher than in other markets for the same goods, but they had some good traditional Korean candies here that we didn't find other places."
Fun! Need to go back!,"I didn't get to spend much time here, but there are lots of interesting things to do and great food. I'll be back!"
A must-see in Seoul,"This is the area where you'll find art galleries, individual art and craft shops, cute coffee shops and street performers. The chain stores seem to have been kept away (apart from a few) which is nice as it makes the area different to the others in the city. The multi-level shopping center is open air and full of quirky shops and street sellers. It's an ideal area to visit to stock up on souvenirs and traditional Korean gifts, this is because they sell the cheap and generic but also the more expensive and coveted Korean items. One down side though: Every time I visit I get stopped and interviewed or filmed by students. I'm sure the local schools set a homework assignment to go and find foreigners to talk to. Fine when you're on you own and have time but a pain when you're with friends or are in a hurry. "
where past meet present,"i fell in love with this area. the mixed modern shopping street with temple, palace, museum...you will never get bored. enjoying street snack with performance . small beautiful rice cake shops. these area accesible through 3 line metro station. "
"Great energy and variety of shops, food, and people-watching","Especially fun on weekends, when the street is pedestrian-only, this is like a street fair that runs for many blocks, with lots of narrow side streets and cul-de-sacs offering hidden treasures. Everyone there is having a great time, strolling, shopping, getting a cool drink in a cafe and people watching. Hint: Try the local favorite PatBingSu, a sweet milkshake that can be customized to different tastes (fruit/green tea/coffee/etc.), but is usually based on fresh fruit. Best I've ever had!"
Not everyone's cup of tea,"Insa-dong is famed for being an area full of art galleries and shops that sell antiques and Buddhist items. If you are into such stuff, look no more. Also, if you really spend some time here, you might find interesting shops that sells unique handicraft that make good souvenirs. Personally I'm not an arts buff, so Insa-dong wasn't appealing to me. Still an interesting place to visit nonetheless. There are lots of tourists here. One stall of interest would be the taffy snack stall. A bunch of guys would say really funny stuff while they transform a slab of honey into hair-like strands that are used to wrap various fillings. Even if you might not like the snack initially, you will succumb to buying one after the ""performance ""! Not cheap though, I bought 4 boxes for 20000 won, and each box contained only 10 taffy. "
Interesting walk,Insa-dong is easy to access from the subway. You can even walk from Bukchon to here. There are lots of shops by both side of the streets selling interesting Korean souvenirs. Great place to buy souvenirs for friends and family.Traditional Korean meals are available in restaurants in Insa-dong. There are great tea-house where you can stay in a hanok and try the traditional teas and snacks. Sikhye is one of my favourite drinks in summer.I will certainly come back to this place when I visit Seoul again. It's nice to spend the afternoon here.
Great area + Korean cooking class available,"Insadong is a must see area of Seoul - it has a lot of restaurants, boutiques. The main street has a lot of calligraphy and other artistic items to bring home, including crockery. Several art galleries (free entries), wonderful local eateries in the little alleyways. The top prize goes to the O'ngo cooking school, where you can learn to make a few local dishes in 2 hours (http://www.ongofood.com/) . Palace is within walking distance as well. All in all, a must see/experience in Seoul!"
"Walk, Talk and enjoy art street of Seoul","Go there and relax walk this street of Insa-dong, there are many art galleries here. "
so much to offer,we chose the Fraser Suites recommended by a friend and the whole area is a pleasant surprise - lots of great restaurants and cafes and it offered a quiet corner of the busy city and yet not far from the shopping and business districts. We ended up spending a lot more time around the area for restaurants.
Great place,"This place was fun for us, they had a lot of the candy and toys that I use to play with when I was a kid"
"Nice collection of street food, shops, & restaurants","Nice collections of shops & restaurants. I picked up most of my souvenirs from this area. Weekdays are better. Weekends are too crowded for my taste. If going in the summer time, head out in the evening to avoid the heat & you can take a night walk along the this man-made river nearby. Shops & vendors start packing up & leaving @ 9PM"
Knick-knacks and art pieces,An amazing place to find great traditional art pieces and souvenirs for friends back home. 
Quaint historical district,"At first, you may find it a little difficult to locate from the subway station, even though it is quite near to it. It is supposedly the historical district in Seoul.The structure is basically a few long avenues with many small streets on the sides. There are several good restaurants in this district, and most of the shops sell little Korean souvenirs.Even if you don't plan to buy anything, it is still worth a walk around. It is also near the historical Gwanghwamun and Samcheong-dong."
Interesting maze of shopping streets and alleyways,Although we didn't purchase anything here we spent an enjoyable time wandering through the many alleys and small shops and had a lovely meal here.
Loved it!,"This shopping area, tourist area was so much fun. This is where you can get the little gifts to bring home. Lots of stuff Korean. Great Korean food. Great area to people watch."
Visited many times. Always worth it.,Always find something nice here. Don't forget to negotiate price. It's nice because it's not too large.
Great place for souvenirs,"If anyone is short on time, but still want to get some souvenirs from Korea, this is the place. There are numerous souvenir shops in this area, and much of the local character. "
A nice area to visit,Lots of ceramic shops and restaurants. Interesting area of Seoul.
Great Shopping!,"I read a lot of reviews online and travel books that say this place is expensive. Not sure why, but there was a lot of stuff there that I felt was great value for money, and I didn't find them elsewhere (having hit the most common tourist spots with souvenir items in Seoul, like Namdaemun, Dongdaemun, Myeongdong, N Seoul Tower, 63 Building, palaces and major museums). They were pretty! I guess we have to make some distinctions:1. If you want to buy the usual Korean souvenirs (keychains, ear caps, teddy bears in hanbok and the wooden mask things), you can find those in the markets and other places at much cheaper prices.2. If you want to buy cute things that don't fall in category 1, it's worth it to buy them here.Perhaps the strategy is to go to Namdaemun or other markets first to see what the prices are/buy generic things before going to Insadong. But in my opinion, I didn't see more than 15% of the stuff in Insadong falling under the category of ""generic Korean souvenirs."" Maybe I wasn't looking?There are places to eat here so you won't go hungry. Make a day trip to the area (near Anguk station) and see Changdeokgung and the Bukchon houses while you're there.Don't forget to see Ssamzie-gil! Enjoy!"
Korean harajuku,"Insadong is a long and wide street, with shops along the way. U can find papers, clothes, acessories, all those fancy stuff.Go to the 4 storey shopping area (don't know the name but huge visibility), at the top level u'll find a fancy ice stall like a mini garden. A good spot to take picture.There are lot's of local snack stall along the way, make sure to try the potato. Nice taste."
All afternoon in the less than a kilometer long street,The main strip is less than a kilometer long but my mom and I spent all afternoon here. (granted that there're lots of little lanes to go see) They sells lots of souveniers which we didn't buy a single one of it. We bought lots of clothes from here. It's a bit higher price than other area but of better quality. 
Kind of overrated,It is a nice place to walk around but I don't think it lives up to the hype. Myong-dong is much more fun to walk around in and there is more to see there
Over-rated shopping district,Many art shops but just as many cheap souvenir shops here. Not impressed.
Dumplings at Myeongdong Sanok,"The mandul (dumplings) at Myeongdong Sanok, Insadong 5 Gil are a must try. They were delicious and the size of my fist. We enjoyed eating at the traditional Korean run restaurant where only locals eat very much."
Sightseeing & Souvenirs,"One-Stop Destinations for Souvenirs shopping. The shops usually have price tags on all items so you won't feel cheated.There are Several coffee shops, food stalls and eating options; it's worth a visit"
Favorite market,"Would recommend this market on your list for sure. Lots of shops, picked up a name scroll and also Hello Kittys in hanboks. There are lots of places to eat and lots of souvenir shops."
Excellent everything,"Some buildings are only open to tourists. Great food, coffee and sights. If you like cream in your coffee ask about cream first before ordering coffee. Very akward exchange if you don't."
Sight seeing.,Not the most interesting place you can find but it provides a look into the typical streets of Seoul.
Korea's Best Tourist Trap,"There are tourist traps and there are tourist traps. Most are to be avoided but not this one. Insadong is a big draw for Koreans - including Seoulites - as well for foreigners. However, it is not what it appears to be to the casual eye.This is technically not a traditional neighborhood, but rather a traditional neighborhood that is constantly reinventing itself, down to changing the layout of alleys not to mention of landlords constantly rebuilding ""traditional buildings.""Thirty or so years ago, this was a relatively laid back collection of junk and antique stores with the usual handful of restaurants. Overtime, Insadong became a magnet for foreign tourists which in turn drew in more local visitors than in the past. Eventually a showdown took place between the artistic types that ran the shops who wished to preserve the original integrity of the place versus the landlords who saw new and greater commercial opportunities. Ten years ago, it all came down to a head. The streets were ""artistically"" repaved, and the rents increased. Most of the original denizens have relocated to the immediate north to other less developed neighborhoods as more restaurateurs have moved into their places.Today, Insadong offers an exceptional collection of very good traditional as well as western restaurants, most at very reasonable prices. It also has Korea's best selection of souvenirs, ranging from cheap and not-so-cheap kitsch to fairly expensive works of art. I often recommend foreign visitors who need to take something home to head off to Insadong, since there is bound to be something that will suit virtually everyone's taste and budget.After visiting a near-by temple or palace, Insadong is a natural next stop to relax and possibly pick up that t-shirt or buy a vase that a merchant will reliably ship home. In spite of its history, I strongly recommend a visit."
Shopping district,Good spot for buying gift back home. safe area with lot of shops and restaurants
Crossed Culture found,There are korean traditional tea houses and museums situated there.Most fun on saturdays and sundays
Shopping in Insa-dong,Insa-dong is an art tourist area. There were some fabulous art galleries and art stores which we had not found anywhere else. No bartering here as there are too many tourists. 
Culture rich alleys,"This place is full of yummy treats, art pieces and unlimited selection of souvenirs... 'would definitely go back to this side of Seoul in my next visit..."
Souvenirs and more!,"Insa-dong is supposed to be the arts hub of Seoul, but we werent able to see a lot of that. I think we were more focused on the shopping there. This is the place to go if you want a one stop shop for souvenirs. They come pretty cheap too. Most stores have price stickers on them so you don't feel that you are being cheated on what you are buying just because you are a tourist. Some shops give minimal discount if you buy 3 or more items. We loved the mochi store there and they have little booths that sell sweet desserts. the desserts are made of pulled rice flour and honey (i think) and they are filled with either walnuts or peanuts or chocolate. This is a must try. This place is near the Jogyesa temple and the Tapgol Park. Pass by those two sites if you have time. There is a Bukchon Village (traditional korean village) that is around a 15 minute trek from Insa-dong. "
Very interesting place,Lots to see and explore in this place. There are also lots of interesting restaurants and cafes around... Need to spare more time to explore
High class shopping,Worth a visit when in Seoul. Think about how you are going to ship the beautiful pottery and tapestries that you find in the boutique stores. Insadong offers a street life that is enjoyable. I've heard that it is more busy on the weekdays instead of the weekends. Enjoy the street food too.
Cool area,"Ssamziegil is cool, chic, and trendy. Nice little shops with handmade or personal designs by young artists. Comfy boulevard to walk along"
Free Hug!!!,"During holiday, there is a lot of people and some students have a thing called ""Free Hugs"" for some reason I didn't bother to ask :) I got a free hug!"
Stroll here,Tourist street - buying will be expensive. But there is a some unique shoes/restaurants. Recommended to stroll here.
Shop till you drop,"I loved the art stores, hand made paper, Korean designer fashion, jewellery and accessories - all so beautiful and hand made by Korean artists - I could have spent all my time here."
Art capital,"Enjoyable, crowded, stylish, artistic, happening, colourful"
Seems to be changing,"I've been visiting Insa-dong every time I'm in Seoul for the last three years. I still like it, but it seems like things are changing and it is becoming more upscale and prices are higher, more high-end shops, restaurants fancier, etc. I liked the way it was before better, but I'd still visit. "
Great Korean experience!,"Lots of great shops, street food, and Korean culture."
We went back several times,"Forget the big markets Namdaemun and Dongdaemun, go to Insadol. Full of Korean crafts - I guarantee that you will find something worthwhile here. Look past the standard tourist stuff. identical in so so many shops, look for handmade crafts. Also plenty of restaurants, a great bakery and coffee house (Crown Bakery) at the north end, and many teahouses. There is also a fair bit of Korean streetfood you must sample. At the south end there is a place where you can sit down to eat your streetfood. And watch out for Korean honey sweets."
Super fun street to walk through,Insadong is a fun little street where merchants sell hand crafts and local delights along with your typical tourist merchandise. Great street super nice atmosphere and a great stroll
Enjoyed the walk despite the rain...,"It was hardly raining when I visited Insadong street. Even though, seeing the antique stores and the handcrafts displayed on the streets were just fascinating that it doesn't matter how many time my umbrella has almost been blown away by the wind. I bought lots of bookmarks with Korean landmarks and cultural heritage materials designs and facts. it was just amazing."
Artsy,A beautiful place to just walk around and enjoy the sights and sounds. There are quaint little shops to browse with lots of trinkets and artsy pieces.I wish I could remember the name of the cafe where we had the delicious ginger tea. The staff were very nice and accommodating. They would also take a polaroid of you and you could either sign the picture and leave your mark by hanging the picture on the wall or take the memorabilia with you. We left out picture. I hope I see it when time we go back.
Pretty cool,"I like Insa-dong for its open shops and loads of traditional items. You can learn and see a lot by walking around the shops. Some of the artisan crafts are amazing and top quality. The downside of this area is that it can be a tourist trap, complete with high prices and crowds."
crafts,not much shoppings and things sold there are not relatively cheap..
Traditional,The place's charm lies in preserving the traditional. Even the starbucks sign is written in korean!
Chilled,"I loved this area, more antique and shops but just seemed quite relaxed so def worth a visit."
Galleries for art displays and shops for handicrafts,"This area of Seoul has numerous art galleries displaying quality contemporary art works. The Kyung-in Museum of Fine Art is actually an art gallery where artists exhibit their works. I spent a fascinating hour there admiring the paintings of a young lady painter who specialised in floral works.The shops have traditional Korean handicrafts including mother-of-pearl inlay work, antique furniture, fans, and the like. These are beautifully crafted but expensive. Incidentally, those who would like to stay at a Korean temple can have information at at the Templestay Information Centre there. At the corner is the Naminsa Open Theatre -an open-air theatre where traditional Korean musical performances were organised during my visit in June. "
I will com back again!,I like the little coffee shops here. They are of characters and warm atmosphere. The handcraft shops are also lovely. It's a shame we do not have sufficient time to visit them all. But we will come back.
Great place for taking in Old Korea,"Insadong will always hold a spot close to my heart. Insadong marketplace can be characterized by small cobbled streets lined with shops specializing in Korean antiques, art, and old fashioned paper. The market place is a great spot for picking up Korean souvenir although a quick trip to Namdemum Market may help you find similar if not the same items at half price!"
Tea-houses and souvenirs,"The ""Old Tea Shop"" in Insa-dong is recommended in Lonely Planet, and yes, it is very cool. I liked it a lot, and enjoyed a cup of cool 5 taste tea. It was fun to spend a couple of hours shopping down the main street in Insa-dong. It's a good place to buy lots of cool and not so expensive gifts (food, clothes, jewellery, knick-knacks)After a couple of hours you are ready for something different though!"
"Great shopping, not as sketchy as Namdaemung or Dongdaemung or Itaewon","Lots of great brick and mortar shops and plenty of places to get a great, cheap, tasty snack from a vendor. Not nearly as flea market-esque as Itaewon, Dongdaemung, or Namdaemung. VERY crowded but definitely worth the trip"
Top end better than bottom,Great little shops at the top end near Anguk subway area. As you go down the street the shops get junkier.
Galleries and Teas,perfect for those who love original artworks and small trinklets. the street is lined with galleries and traditional teahouses. while the alleys on the sides are chock-a-block full of restaurants and more teahouses! love this area.
Great place for youngsters & great restaurants.,I love that it has lots of selection of restaurants to select. I could try different meals on different time of the day.It's a place to shop for unique items not found elsewhere. Lots of youngsters love to hang out here. You will get to see interest artistic items here.
Nice place,A very nice shopping place with friendly shop owners and negotiable prices.
Best shopping!,"Insadong is the best place that we went to for shopping. The shopping for souvenirs, korea novelty items and clothing was great. The prices were affordable and negotiable to a certain extent. We bought keychains, traditional fans, t-shirts, souvenir plates. We ate at a wonderful restaurant, and there are 100's of choices, there are also traditional food carts on the road to experiment and try some of the local delicacies. Insadong is a MUST do in Seoul."

Look between the places,"Insadong is an artsy tourist place with many places selling Korean souveniours. But look closer between these places, you will find some unusual places like old-toy collection museum (upstairs half way through the main street) which has toys from 60s childhood, food stalls selling poo-bread or making honey-sweets while singing, rare hanji paper doll shops... These are the things that makes Insadong memorable to me."
Fun stroll with shopping and things to eat,"Best place to souvenir shop. Stop at the 4 story building (about halfway down the street). Would definitely recommend the soft serve green tea ice cream on the second floor! Osulloc to buy some green tea; the ""Tea Museum"" is actually a tea shop and it's a fun place to sit and have a tea."
Must visit in Seoul,"This area is a must see on a trip to Seoul. The area is stocked with traditional shops, gifts, foods. It is full of tourists and the prices tend to be higher here than other areas, however it's a nice area to walk through and see."
Allocate a day...,"All the senses get a work out here...from the smells of food, the artworks, the array of clothes, cultures....this place is well worth a look. Easy access by train, Insa-dong is lovely cobbled streets, classy shops with lots to see and do. You can idle away the hours easily here....MUST SEE in Seoul. For lunch...Try the Bibimbap @ the SSamziegil Centre...downstairs.. "
Lots of choice from these markets,"These markets depend on good weather to really show to their best advantage as our first day was blustery, very wet and cold. The second time we visited the sun was out and all the shops had stalls out the front.From handmade paper (beautiful) to fashion you have it all. Ok to barter at this market. Explore the side alleys too for food and crafts."
With Dharma friend.,Enjoy daytime drinking...kkkk..I have many conversation with him. he camed from abroad to study meditaion with our group. Thank you for the good time.
antique street,"there is first starbucks who put signboard in local language in the world. after that Starbucks started to use local languages for the signboard. This street used to be very quietfor the pensive writers, artiests, etc. however, it became a bit commercial street but you can still get nice traditional gifts for your beloved ones. if you explore the allies inside of main street, you can enjoy local food and traditional teas"
Shopping & Eating,"This caters to a different crowd from Dongdaemun and Namdaemun market. I prefer shopping here as it is not noisy. Galleries, antique stores, teahouses, coffee outlets, restaurants dotted the area. "
"My favorite part of Seoul, not a resturant","I have been visiting Seoul every year since 1978'and I still find this to be my favorite part of the city. In the past few years it has become more commercial and touristy but it is remains charming and full of things to see and do. If you don't speak Korean you can still enjoy the tea houses and art gallery's. The gallery's change exhibits frequently and one night a week (I think Wed) they have open houses and gallery walkmin the evenings. Great place to buy souvineers and traditional jewelry in this area is amazing. My favorite spot is called Four Sisters. (I do not know Korean name)On weekends they close the street to traffic and often have street festivals and parades. Forget itaewon, enjoy Insadong!"
"Did not have great appeal, too designed for tourists","Insa-dong was on our list of places to visit while in Seoul, but we were disappointed on the make-up of the area, it is very touristy, we spent only about an hour here, before moving on."
somewhat touristy but still charming,Great place to pick up souvenirs and gifts. Lots of Korean arts and crafts- from traditional to modern
Tourist Trap,The whole place is a tourist trap. Everything is pricey. Nothing spectacular about this place.
Ok place to go and look around,To me Insadong is an ok place to visit. I was there to see Ssamsiegil which is very interesting mall(?). It's the street of traditional items. Lots of people recommend this place to be place where you should buy souvenir. But I disagree. I find the prices are a bit high compare to average. You can find lower prices in Namdaemun or other places. Another thing that I like is the Starbucks written in Korean. I think it's cute :) So spend time there looking around. Try some traditional Korean snacks and tea house. Visit Ssamsiegil. Then off to other places....
Antique street in Seoul,"This is the only place you can buy traditional souveniors in Seoul. The first Starbuck who puts their shop's sign in local language in the world, because this street is really traditional one so the all the residence of that street could not accept English sign board in the street. It was big issue when Starbucks penestrated in that antique street. However, grwoing as a commercial place step by step, the old nostalgy started to fade away from the street. But still worth to visit to feel the sense of Korea traditional arts and antiques."
Tons of shops and atmosphere,"Lots of little shops and street vendors - great way to spend a couple of hours or so. Restaurants are all located in the little back alleyways, so lots of fun to roam. We went in the afternoon but it's probably tons of fun at night. "
Enjoyed it!,"We walked to Insadong from Gyeongbokkung Palace. Was surprised at how modern the shops were as I was expecting something more quaint. The souvenir shops sell pretty much similar Korean souvenirs e.g. fans, magnets, fabric pouches, jewellery boxes etc. The souvenirs are not cheap - US$5 for a fridge magnet! Some mini art galleries too.What we enjoyed most were the little eateries, some tucked away in the little alleyways. Ssamziegil is a little courtyard of little shops and my sons were offered rice/nut crackers for free by a kind vendor. I felt obliged to buy a packet of mixed crackers since the vendors were so generous. We also stumbled upon a little popular dumpling shop in an alleyway where we tried 2 types of dumplings (steam and prawn) freshly made. It was an experience. After 12 p.m., some diners had to wait their turn to get a seat in this cozy little eatery. There is a posh looking tea house next to the dumpling shop which we didn't have time for.Towards the end (south of the Insadong street), we passed a cartwheel vendor selling sweet custard bread. The couple seems to be famous for their sweet bread. Won 2,000 for a bagful of sweet bread - cheap and delicious!We are usually careful with what we consume and are unadventurous with street food (for fear of tummy problems) but none of us had any tummy problems. Truely glad we tried the various food stalls - what an experience. The vendors were not at all pushy.Would have given it a '5' rating but wished the shops were more 'traditional' looking and not 'modern'."
Excellent art scene,"We kept coming back, so much to see and buy! Good food, good art. Forget the markets, this is the place to spend your time."
Make sure to explore the back alleys!,"Insadong is a great tourist place to pick up nicknacks, but it also has a lot of great restaurants, so explore the back alleys, and see what you can't find of interest. "
Good area to walk around,"Very interesting and lively, especially on the weekend. There are lots of food stands and interesting things to try and look at"
Good tourist stop.,"There are a TON of things to buy here. It is really a big tourist attraction. Lots of Korean souvenirs. I think you could probably find most of the stuff in other places for a cheaper price, as these prices are jacked for tourist reasons. Still, lots to see and experience there. "
A showcase of Korean art and culture in the heart of the city,"If your schedule is too cramped to accommodate a visit to a typical Korean village or 'hanok', at least make time to walk around Insadong. Seoulites may find Insadong a little contrived or even a tourist trap, but as a regular business traveller to Seoul, I am glad I finally visited Insadong. I was charmed by the traditional Korean style buildings, dropped by a Korean tea house (the cakes are too sweet), watched street performances for free (weekends only) without shelling out ￦ for a NANTA ticket and loitered too long (and probably bought more ornaments and trinkets that I should have) at the big Korean handicraft emporium there."
Lovely stroll,"I stayed at Jongno and took a long leisurely route starting from Changdeokgung Palace, down through the quaint and beautiful Samcheongdong, stopped for coffee at a cafe, then continued walking down towards Insa-dong. Absolutely a delightful stroll, even though I didn't buy anything, it was fun to browse and to immerse in the bustle. Stopped by the Beautiful Tea Museum as well and went up the winding 6-storey shopping complex in Insa-dong. Also had strawberry cheese tart at Paris Croissant in Insa-dong, AMAZING! We had a very lovely day."
Beautiful and appealing,"Insadong was one of my favourite places to go while living in Korea. It's very Korean - by which I don't mean Disneyfied little houses, but a proper street with alternating concrete horrors and lovely shophouses. The tea shops are great, and some have little courtyard gardens out the back. The art shops are also interesting, and I bought lots of paper and Chinese brushes here."
good souvenir buying :),great place to shop for souvenirs! good price and a very nice place to visit...
Great fun,"We visited Insa-dong twice. The first time for a look around and the second to buy the craft items we had spotted on our first visit. Some of the shops are better than the others and we liked the cultural craft shops best where we bought gifts for ourself and family. Some items are cheap while others, such as examples of Korean costume more expensive. Would return for another visit should we return to Korea."
Tea Houses galore,"Nice way to experience the culture and have tea. Best finds are in the alleys believe it or not. Plenty of places to find something to eat. Most are OK, some are just fine to pass by and grab a picture."
"A conditional ""4"" rating ....","Strolled down the main Insa-dong street and spent less than 1.5 hours there .... so I'm sure I missed the hidden gems and more memorable attractions (would have loved to try the tea houses). What I saw was less than I expected, because I expected a very traditional Korean village-like area with colorful architecture. But that might be unfair .... I did enjoy walking past the wide variety of shops (too many souvenir stalls, though), and had a nice laugh with those fast-chatting/singing boys selling a type of white-honey-candy. Plus, it's a treat to see the green Starbucks sign rendered in Korean writing! With more time, I'm sure I could have explored the alleyways and visited more traditional shops and tried more local fare."
Wide variety of local arts and crafts...and street food!,Liked everything about it. Shops sold everything you can think of for yourself or gifts plus more. We had the best steamed dumplings and street food here too!
Loved Insadong,We stayed near Insadong we visited a few times. Great shopping if you're looking for cultural or traditional items. 
Good place for souvenirs,A one stop place for souvenirs shopping. Yoy will be spoilt for choice for local street food too.
Tourist Haven,"We visited Insadong for interesting finds to take home for souvenirs and gifts. There are also many art galleries and coffee shops and street foods. Artsy pieces includes fashion accessories, fans, crafts, house ornaments, amethyst jewelries, etc. Plan to spend around 2 hours here to shop and have some snacks in between."
The Best,"This is one of my favorite areas in Seoul. I have been living here for 2+ years. I always bring friends and family that are visiting to Insadong. It is just lovely. If you are heading to Seoul, make time to visit this area. There are lots of tea shops and you can participate in a tea ceremony. There are also wonderful and unique items to purchase for wonder souvenirs! ENJOY!"
Great buys,the prices are cheap and the crafts are very artsy and there lots of items for souvenir.
Korean traditional and culture hub,"If you are looking for the heart of Korean culture in Seoul, Insadong is the place to visit. It features a large street and small alleys of folk art galleries, antique shops, souvenir stalls, and cultural icons like Tongmungwan {oldest Seoul bookstore} & Kyung-in Art Gallery {oldest Seoul tea-house}.Walking along Insadong, when you are tired, you can take a rest at the many book cafes or tea houses that dot the area. Sip a cup of tea and soak in the atmosphere of traditional Korean culture. If you are lucky, you might even be able to catch a lovely Korean performance of the Gayageum {Korean zither}. Actually there's a lot of yatai food stalls along the road too, so you can just buy Korean street food like deokbokki {cylindrical rice cakes in chilli sauce}, soondae {stuffed pig's intestines}, potato tornadoes {deep-fried spiral potatoes, yum!} or hotteok {pancakes with sweet caramelized fillings, my fave!}. Perfect food for cold autumn/winter days!There are helpful volunteer guides around Insadong that speak major languages like English, Mandarin and Japanese. They have maps in the various languages too so not to worry about getting lost! On weekends, the main road is closed to vehicular traffic, but it is also very packed then!More posts on our Korean trip here: http://www.sakuraharuka.com/search/label/korea"
Heaven for souvenirs,"A lot of shops, different range of price. Choose the small shop/stall for cheaper bargain"
Typical Tourist Spot,It's very crowded during weekend. Nothing much or fanciful.It just one straight passage way walking through souvenirs shops and some restaurants.It's expensive though.
Hodgepodge of Curious shops,Dont be shy and head into each and every shop and you'l definitely be able to find something unique inside. You'l be able to spend a good part of your day there just wandering around and trying food.There's a fried pancake shop that always has a queue. Worth trying for the sweet pancakes.
For the artist in you.,"Lots of paintings, street food, see traditional arts and craft. There are actual tour groups visiting this area. Recommend to go on weekends to enjoy the crowds."
Shopping and snacks,"Cute souvenirs, but the street snacks are so yummy! A must try is the royal candies they spin out of honey, and the brown sugar bun type pastries! They made my trip. There are also stores selling teas which is always nice to bring home."
Traditional market,"A traditional street selling lot of handmade craft and stuffs. Just 1min walk from Anguk Stn. and Insa-dong close for vehicles on Sunday. here, you can try hanbok for 3000-5000won at Insa-dong Tourism Information centre and any other traditional experience. There are also a vegetarian restaurant called Sosim, 5min walk from exit 6, Anguk stn. Its at 2nd floor of GS25. "
District to visit,"A little bit chaotic, but worth the visit, it is a in district and the center for art galleries and museum"
Perfect place for the arty-farty!,"Excellent place for visiting, relax and just bask yourselves amongst the artistic stuff here. But be warned its not cheap - good things come at a price!"
art place,"we do the caricature for KRW10000 each, we do our own name Seal worth krw30000 as a momento."
Relax and Chill,"Arty Farty place to chill out, a little street food in this 500m stretch of easy walking area. A lot of art pieces around if you can afford to buy it back."
"""Everything Korean""",In this lovely location in Seoul you can find any kind of Traditional Korean products. Especially if you are looking for some little memoirs or gifts to take back home!
not much tradition in traditional Insadong,"A lot of trendy art galleries and Korean restaurants.. not much traditional feeling when Hanok style.. better to take a day stroll north.. felt like a big mall.. complete with rice beating show.. no sidewalk cafe, no music, dance, Korean culture on display .. art shows rule.. tourist trap."
Hot spot for tourists!,"One of the hot spots for tourists!! There are so many tourists there, the best place to buy souvenirs! Korean restaurants and I loved this place that specialize in Korean rice cakes. For tourists it's a must! "
Artsy Area of Seoul,"Loved Insadong!Many small streets with quaint restaurants to check out. Especially loved the feel of the area with drawings/paintings around. Ssamziegil is a must visit there as well with all the artsy things for sale. Some stuff can be found outside for cheaper though, so spend wisely. Otherwise, it's still goo for a lookaround."
Nice place to spend an afternoon,"When you are at insadong, a must do is to explore the small alley. You will find restaurant, tea houses, pubs, art gallery..etc. The main street is lined with souvenirs stores. Most of the gifts that are sold at insadong can also be found at Dongdaemun. Look out for shops selling traditional korea craftwork, porcelain and ceramic wares. Also, do not forget to check out Ssamziegi, a shopping and art complex."
Great People Watching,"This neighborhood was full of energy and people on a summer weekend in Seoul. The streets were packed with people enjoying shopping, music, tea, and snacks. We enjoyed a traditional meal in a small, back alley restaurant filled with plants and many different nooks and crannies. The area is loaded with tea shops of all sorts...laid-back, chic, stylish, loud, mellow, etc. There are souvenirs ranging from cheap and cheerful to elegant and original. Walking up and down this neighborhood reminded me of a Korean version of promenading down Las Ramblas in Barcelona."
"Tourist place, with good shopping area","Insadong is place for catching the traditional korean shopping experience. Small shops and street side displays are standard here. I like the live demonstration of making rice dessert with honey. Also lots of Korean stuff like wall paintings, embroideries and toys. I got to eat the vegan food in the alley here. Real nice."
Vibrant,"Nice part of Seoul, I was told Insa-dong means ""cultural area"" in English. Nice restaurants, shops and galleries. Imagine Camden Town in Asia. 4 storey shopping center with no stairs is unique. Dont miss it if you go to Seoul."
Antiques,This area is more to old and antiques stuffs and have to go though many alleys but it was fun as we managed to see many things.
Great place for shopping,A little quieter than Myeongdong with most of the same gifts items for sale.
Best Place for Korean Souvenirs,"This area is the best value for money souvenir area in Seoul. There are other places where you can spend lots more and even some where you can spend lots less, but this is the best value for quality products."
Fun neighborhood,for tea-shops and veggie restaurants-- though the chains are taking over and these days you have to watch out for made-in-China souvenirs.
Getting more touristy and less unique,"as years go by, but still a nice place for traditional tea-shops, vegetarian restaurants, and genuine Korean souvenirs. . . just beware that some things these days are ""made in China"""
very traditional,"I go to Insa-dong every time I go to Seoul, and I lived in Seoul I'd go every month or so because it just feels nice walking around the streets of Insadong sightseeing, looking through the artsy shops, to buy a piece or two of pretty jewelry... However, I don't recommend buying souvenirs in Insa-dong: it's expensive. Go to Dongaemun market if you're looking forward to buying a fair amount of souvenirs for family, friends and coworkers. "
artsy and hip,just a fun area with great art and souvenirs- just a really cool vibe to it
I don't understand why they're so popular...,"Many Koreans know that Insadong is a tourist trap. Only Koreans that visit this area are kids from the suburbs and foreigners with a Lonely Planet book to equip them. It's so ironic that there are many places right outside of Insadong that are fantastic yet people don't venture there because it's not ""FAMOUS"". It's your money not mine, so do as you please."
Great shopping street,Particularly liked the market off to one side. Really wished I'd bought that fish mobile now. Really good shopping from cheap to expensive. Plenty of choice.
Quaint Touristy Seoul,"Always full of tourists, Insa-dong still mesmerizes me being the artist hub of Seoul with it's handcrafted beauties and delicious traditional treats and tea houses. The architecture along with the traditional wares for sale, make for a great day whether a tourist or a live in ex-pat, it's a repeated must see.Also the best place to get dressed up in traditional Korean garb and take high quality photos at a great price. "
Great place for souvenirs and shopping,"One of the best places to pick up traditional korean gifts, and souvenirs is Insadong. While here, try and have tea at the Old Tea shop, where live birds will sing to you while you enjoy a good cup of tea."
Best eating place for lunch and shopping,"Have been to Seoul 3 times in the last 12 months. I cannot leave without visiting Insadong. It is very artsy but what I like more is the shopping. As you enter, focus on the left side of the road. There are paths on the left that will bring you to several eateries. Once we went to a restaurant that you sit on the floor and it's called Royal menu. We just looked to see where the crowd was going or coming out of. It was very inexpensive - $15 US and food kept coming out like there was no end in sight. My husband is a huge eater but even he was very full. After you eat, come back to the main street and keep focusing on the left hand side. There is a shopping complex that spirals up. You can walk up but we take the elevator to the top and start browing/shopping from there. There are several corner shops selling the cutest earrings,rings, cell phone holders, etc. and numerous shops selling artsy/pretty goods i.e. hats, backpacks, knitted items, etc. Very trendy. I always find good gifts to bring home for my daughters and granddaughter from there. There are also many places you can have tea. Not just your regular green or black tea but fancy ones some served in huge soup like bowls even with ice depending on what you order. Everything is very pretty in Insadong. I LOVE the atmosphere there."
A visit to Insadong,Wonderful for window shopping and for buying nice gifts and prices are good compared to some other shopping areas. An enjoyable place to spend half a day!
nice shopping area with lots of good restaurant & tea houses,"like the atmosphere of the area, many nice restaurants & tea houses/coffee houses"
Small house area,"Sightseeing, charming small houses, good restaurants, shopping cultural things etc.. Nice area you shouldn't miss when your in Seoul."
Week of New Years,"Some very interesting shops in this area - usually selling souvenirs. My first experience here was during the week of New Years. The streets were so crowded people could barely walk! It's a great way to stay warm during the winters in Seoul.I did have a man ask me for money, but he was yelling in Korean and I didn't understand what he was saying until after. A man from one of the shops tried to stop him, but he tried to fight!Aside from that, very neat shops and restaurants located around. Have been back a few times since."
worth a look,"If you like arty things, ornaments, textiles, china, pottery etc. Cute and fun to explore."
interesting walking area,I walked couple of times in the evening - it's full of people shopping. eating and relaxing after a busy day. As anywhere in Korea it's safe and comfortable. 
For a walk and shopping,could find traditional souvenirs and nice cafe. Recommend to visit here if you're first time for Seoul.
Great place for Korean trinkets,"Great place to go in the middle of Seoul for some Korean trinkets. There are lots of kiosks outside to buy street food and trinkets, and there are a vew ver large trinket shops. Prices and selection are much better than Itaewan. It is a few blocks from the Gyeonbok Palace, so combine it with a tour of there."
"Good for shopping, food....etc",I am Korean but I visit here often. Korean cafes are awesome.
"Yeah, it's made to absorb tourist money, but I like it anyway.","Insadong is a precinct (or ""dong"") in the Jongno-gu district of Seoul. Insadong-gil (""street"") is the main attraction and it is an approximately 15 - 20 minute leisurely walk from end to end. Home to a wide variety of traditional craft shops, tea houses, restaurants, food stalls and various gift shops ranging from those that carry quaint, culturally significant items to others that try to pawn useless plastic garbage at ridiculous prices, I would say that Insadong-gil is a pleasant if not occasionally chintzy low-key tourist experience. Please note that while the street is closed to cars on weekends due to large crowds, the weekdays are better if you want a less frenetic experience, regardless of the occasionally impatient driver zipping along the street. Also, I have enjoyed my many visits to this place, but I strongly suggest that you seek food elsewhere since the restaurant food quality here is only average while the prices can be 3 or 4 times what you would pay only a 25 minute walk in any direction. While there you should definitely:1. Get some Hotteok - a fried bread with brown sugar and peanut bits melted in the middle (careful, it drips), as well as sample some of the other street foods.2. Visit Jogyesa, a Korean Buddhist temple only 5 minutes from Insadong-gil. There is also a great resource center nearby to help anyone interested in exploring Korean Buddhism in greater depth.3. Also consider going to nearby Gyeongbokgung (aka Gyeongbok Palace) to experience the ""Palace of Shining Happiness"". An historical site well worth a tour."

Tourist Trap,"I've done the typical foreigner holiday shopping around Insa-dong multiple times now...The items never change (in the main shops), the prices only go up, and no matter how hard I try to bargain, I feel like I'm always being ripped off no matter what I'm buying. The small street cart vendors seem to possibly be authentic craftworkers, but it's hard to tell."
Lovely street,"A relaxing shopping street selling a lot of knick knacks and souvenirs, one of my favorite areas in Seoul"
"Walk, Eat and Enjoy","Narrow streets, Many small tea houses, and Korean restaurants, street food, galleries, and the best souvenir shops. In my experience the best tea and Kimchi can be found there. "
Tourist prices,Tourist prices are three to four times more expensive. Go to Namdaemun market instead where you can find identical items for half or a third the price.
Souvenirs,This is the place to buy souvenirs and gifts for friends at home...
Best place for souvenirs,"If you want something to take home to friends, family and co-workers, this is truly the best place in all of Korea. Speciality shops and all-you-can-think-of-shops have unique souvenirs including kimchi-chocolate ^^ The area also has numerous side streets for exploring things such as Tea Museums and Tea Houses and of course numerous dining options. There's always a lot going on in this neighborhood, so if you're trying to avoid crowds or tourists, this isn't the place to go, otherwise, there's a reason so many folks line the streets, it's just pleasant."
"Too touristy, rather visit north of Insa-dong",Insa-dong is where you can try Korean cuisine and buy unique souvenirs. However the food is average and over priced. Also the souvenir shops are quite expensive as well. I'd recommend rather visiting north of Insa-dong where you can see the traditional Korean houses.
Wonderful!!!,Wanna feel Korean culture & food? Then this place can't be missed! Old street behind the main street in Insadong has lots of good restaurants.
Great food!,"Insadong is the cultural centre of Seoul so if you're into arts and culture, this is the place to be. Even if you're not that big on arts, Insadong has lots of great authentic Korean food on offer. There're many alley ways throughout and each has a selection of restaurants and tea houses. Tea is comparatively expensive, generally around 4,500 - 6,000 won which is about the same as a lunch meal. But then, it's kind of like coffee houses and it's expected that you'd sit there for quite a while to appreciate the tea and chit chat or serve the net using wifi (widely available).Ssamziegil is an open mall with lots of little designer shops selling locally designed and made accessories off the main street in Insadong and definitely worth a visit. "
Where you go when you wanna find Souvenirs,"While Dongdaemun might be the better place to find Korean souvenirs, Insa-dong is where you go when you want to find them all on one street block quickly and easily. They have everything from Korean flags, to masks, to tea pots (I bought one for my grandmother that is gorgeous) to hand made stamps with your own personalized messages, chop sticks, clothes, purses (not Coach purses ladies, don't get too excited). Sometimes there are live cultural performances as well which makes it a great place to go for shopping and culture. There is a bird tea house (its name says it all) but it is a little hard to find. There are ""information girls"" who walk around to help you, and if you are coming from the subway there is an information booth where you can ask them about this tea house as well. Overall, I think all countries have that place you go when you are a tourist that allows you to buy souvenirs...if you don't need any, I think that you could probably skip this and go to some other markets that are much more impressive like Namdaemun or Dongdaemun."
Very touristy but worth a visit,Very touristy but a must see neighborhood. Especially like it because of the number of vegetarian restaurants and art galleries. The neighborhood a bit north of Insadong is the same kind of neighborhood but much less touristy.
Very Interesting & Lots of Crafts,Strolling through this area was fascinating and time flew by. Did our souvenir shopping here and found some great craft stores.
Great place to shop and eat,Great place to shop and eat! Lovely people with occasional events.
Souvenir items,"This street is full of stores selling very nice souvenir items.A must place to visit. Not very crowded, but not idle.There are several restaurants and street food vendors, too."
Cultural Walk,This must see place is adjacent to Jongno gil which is walking distance from Doulos Hotel. There is a photo booth that allows you to take picture from a scenic background of Insadong stage and send it to your email.
My favorite place in Korea!,"While it is rather touristy, Insadong is absolutely one of my favorite places in Korea. I never bought much, but it's beautiful and a great place to wander through and just look. Also a great place for Christmas shopping because there's something for everyone! Atmosphere is happy and fabulous. "
"Culture, art zone","Interesting place. Lots of handicrafts but pricing at a relatively high price. The ""똥빵 (ttong bbang)"" sold there is nice. Go queue for it!"
"For tourists""","When I visited Korea in early December 2011, I was told that Insa-dong is one of the must-visit places. I didn't really know what it was but was told that it's a very happening area. When I went to visit, I noticed there were a lot of tourist/souvenir shops. However, I had the impression that the entire street was a tourist trap. Lots of expensive souvenirs...whether they're customized stamps, wedding ducks, fans, business car cases, etc. I think the prices were multiples of what you could pay at Namdaemun. Anyways, there was a lot of good food from street vendors, and the souvenir shops were very nice to look at."
Insa-dong and shopping!,"This is one of my favorite streets in Korea. There are lots of teahouses, fantastic restaurants, coffeehouses, and lots of shopping! The shopping is for those with an artistic bent, or for souvenirs. There is food being prepared in front of you as well. Have fun!! "
Artistic area,"Artistic area, a lot of souvenir shops selling traditional Korean paper and arts etc. Plenty of traditional Korean restaurants. Recommend the traditional tea houses where you get to taste traditional tea and traditional desserts. Prices are on the high side in this area. I also managed to buy postcards in Insadong. Couldn't find any in Myeongdong and Namdaemun."
Nice for tourists or new arrivals,"Insadong is a great place to get a feel for Korean arts and crafts. Ii's a nice change from the concrete block construction that is so common all over Korea. The good here are a bit more expensive than other places, still worth the visit."
Great place for dinner and souvenir shopping,"Insa-dong was listed in our suggested Cultural Heritage itinerary and we visited it late at night towards the end of our 2nd evening in Korea for some shopping.We found several shops selling souvenir items and bought several gifts for friends and family. There were some food stalls outside, but we didn't get to buy any food gifts. We got some gold-plated bookmarks, several slippers, shirts, a fan, cute socks, earrings and several keychains. :)We went back the next day for some dinner and some more shopping. Although we visited late at night, we felt safe walking around this area, although we kept to the main street. We did encounter some slightly drunk people singing out loud or shouting but nothing serious.We learned later from the map we got at an information booth near the entrace that there were several historical sites in this area which we missed since we visited at night. This would be a good reason to come back. :)"
This place is a MUST!!,"Loved this place. I can´t wait to go back. Great tea places, art galleries, shopping, everything!!"
fantastic,"i just loved the items sold there. they are mostly hand-made or hand crafted, really unique!"
Nice traditional artistic district,"Always amazed on how Korean government able to preserved traditional district, neigbourhood or street into touristic commercial area. This one also no exception. This road and little lanes branching out is where you could find tarditional shops selling hadicrafts, eating places and tea houses. A must if you are into traditional things. "
Cosy area,Had some tea here in a little shop off the insadong rd. Located close to the palaces and has a bunch of little shops selling hand bags and tea sets.
Great area for an authentic taste of Seoul,Insa-dong is a fabulous base for sampling the street food and arts of Seoul. Also a convenient jumping-off point for exploring the rest of this incredibly dynamic city.
cool stores,"It's not just for shopping, the place is full of interesting structures and ideas"
Transit tour-unforgetable,"Had a 10 hour layover at Incheon, took a 7 hour transit tour with Hana Tour to Seoul for just US$40, visted the famous stream, plaza, 2 palaces, temple and Insadong. Had free traditional lunch at Insadong, got to do shopping- many shops take US dollars and credit card. Shop keepers were very friendly, street food and souvenirs were cheap. eye catching unique crafts for cheap. spent about over an hour, wanted to stay longer. our tour guide was wonderful. though you can't see all of seoul in 5 hours as the travel time from to airport was over an hour each way- you still can atleast see parts of it. well worth it. I will recommend this to family and friends and will try this again especially Insadong- plenty of shopping, restaurants and just a place to hang out day or night."
Art and Craft at street,"They are many shops the whole street. Many selling art and craft items and they are very interesting and original. Many souvenirs items you can purchase there even though not cheap. I manages to find earrings and accessories selling very cheap at one shop eg earring only 1,000 won compare to what I bought in Namdemun for 2000-8000 won. Those accessories are beautiful, but not sure about quality"
Great area!,"The main Insa-dong area is a bit touristy and souvenir-oriented, which is nice, but if you stroll north (past the girl's middle school) you'll find an adjacent area that's much more relaxed and stylish.Highly recommended :)"
Touristy but fun otherwise...,"It is a must place to do, so you can tick it off your list. If you have more time, explore the back alley for more authentic korean food."
lots of shopping and street food,"can be quite busy depending on the time and day. but lots of shopping, street food, and non-street food to be had"
Good Market place,I like walking around so....Very crowded though. Just about anything one would want can be found in this market.
Nice Atmosphere,"There is a lot of things to do in Insa-dong, depending on what you are looking for. Shopping, art galleries, cultural and heritage centres, restaurants and cafes, etc. Personally I like to go to their traditional tea house where you can chill with a cup of nice tea and yummy handmade Korean pastries. Besides that you can take a leisure walk along the main street where you can browse through a lot of traditional Korean arts and handicraft shops. Over the weekend it can get a bit crowded so be prepared."
Great Souvaneir Shops,"We found that out of all the shopping districts (Nam Dae Moon, Dong Dae Moon, Lotte) Insa-dong reflected Korean culture the best. There are tons of Korean art galleries to walk through. Also, there are lots of souveneire shops too with tranditional Korean art, pottery and ceremics. This is all in addition to the coffee shops and plethora of KOrean restaurants!"
Smaller than we thought,"Perhaps we were on the wrong street? Didn't see much of this place, only about two blocks long.Did we miss it?"
Definitely worth a stroll through,"The Seould City Tour bus dropped us off across the street from the entrance to Insadong. If this is your first time visiting Insadong (like us), be sure to stop at the beginning of the main street. There you will find an information booth for tourist that can help give you maps, booklets, information, etc. We asked for a recommendation to eat and they pulled out this binder full of information ... perhaps too much information. We just wanted lunch :-) Also, right next to the booth was a little old lady selling fresh roasted chestnuts from her makeshift cart. Delightful but I think it may have been overly priced for tourist.Sights and impressions of Insadong: pleasant atmosphere, no street hawkers to be found, storefront loud speakers coaxing you to go in, clean streets, organized mixture of things to see/do. Ssamzigil had shops showcasing independent art works and was nice to browse around in. Because the price of food and souvenirs in this area seems to be slightly higher for the same things elsewhere in Seoul, It definitely felt like a tourist spot but is definitely worth a stroll through."
Shop & Eat,Organized place to walk and shop. Lotsa food place.
Delightful shopping district!,"Insa-dong is lovely! I found it to have merchandise of a bit higher quality than some of the other shopping districts, no street touts and the crowds are bit more bearable.If you're looking for uniquely Korean gift ideas - go here. They've got it all!While there - pop in at Topgal Park!"
Too touristy!,"My third time at Insadong over a period of ten years and found that it has become too commercialised, vendors and shopkeepers indifferent to tourists (better service at Myeongdeong), food at some restaurants only so-so and quite a few over-priced. Best thing was the Tourist Promotion Board workers who stopped to ask tourists what help they needed. We were very grateful to the young man who gave us clear direction to Hotel Doulos which was tucked away in a backstreet; glad they now have such a service, thank you very much!"
Not my cup of tea,"Very overcrowded, in the midst of tourists, pseudo-traditional restaurants with exorbitant prices. You can also by tiny traditional tea cups for 80 $ upwards. We walked through and made sure we go out if there quickly."
A lovely place to walk and feel the buzz,"Loved the concentration of stores selling all things related to Korean culture. Hip and happening budding Korean artists also set up stores here, especially at Ssamziegil. Totally recommend! Suggest you devote at least 2hours to explore and have tea at the old tea shop."
"Enjoyable Shopping, Mix of the Traditional","I enjoyed Insa-dong very much and am regretful that I wasn't able to visit more than once because of my limited time there. It is a pleasant, fun place to shop and wander around in. The tempo is not as crazy as some of the other markets I went to and I liked the mix of art galleries, restaurants, cafes, pubs and other things that are sort of hidden away in the alleys and side streets nearby. It's a good place to buy souvenirs and gifts, to have a cup of tea, or browse some of the more traditional Korean arts and crafts. I love handmade paper, so I especially enjoyed one of the shops there whose specialty was that. I also enjoyed queuing up at a street stall for what seemed to be a very popular thing...walnut cakes. There was an extremely long line so I figured...hey, gotta be good-right? Yes, it was worth buying. I enjoyed those cakes while strolling the neighborhood!"
for those who loves art,"i prefer myeongdong because I love shopping, but if you are looking for souvenirs, chose this place."
Nice place to visit,"It was a business trip and supposed to be very hectic week. Somehow a cab driver lost his way and drove me around Seoul. I saw Insadong - road signage ""Tourist Information"". It seems that it is a tourist area. Yes, it is. I walked to Insadong the following day after work. It was a very nice place to visit but beware that tourist (like me who don't speak Korean) may be ripped off at restaurant if there is no price tag on the menu. Otherwise, it is a nice place to visit (traditional Korean little shops, handicraft, etc). Take your camera along"
Worth your time!,"This is an amazing district of art, crafts, local foods and Korean artifacts. One could spend hours wandering around, enjoying the local flavor. Plenty of tourists, but it didn't have a touristy feel."
One of the best spots in Seoul,This is a really nice place to go and watch some art and also buy some presents. They do have some really nice traditional style resturants here as well. This is the place I always go to when ever I am in Seoul!
Touristy shopping,"This is a great place to stroll and window shop because it is pretty, active, and inviting, but the prices and goods are definitely aimed at the tourists or higher end shoppers. You can find the same things in the underground arcades or market areas in Dongdaemun."
A semi traditional Korea for shoppers and tea drinkers!,"I love shopping. I love various teas. I love Insadong! Great place for souveneirs and lots of traditional tea houses (the citron honey tea is my favourte). Usually crammed with toursits so not for the claustraphobic.Insadong also holds a lantern festival around April/May time, I'd definitely recommend going, beautiful lantern parade and lots of other activites. Take lots of money and wear comfy shoes! Also make sure to watch the guys making the honey treats. They use honey and some kind of flour and put on a real show when they get a bit of a crowd."
"""Good price souvenirs and a place to eat""","one of a must to visit. There's shops to buy, places to eat and also souvenirs shops in a very good price."
Cute,"Disclaimer: I hate shopping.I would not have ended up here if I didn't need to bring souvenirs to the folks back home.With that said, I surprised myself by spending several hours here. I thought I'd be in and out in about an hour, but I found myself wandering in and out of artisan shops and art galleries, checking out food stalls and just enjoying the bustle. Insa-dong is worth visiting for people watching alone. A couple of hours later, I realized I hadn't managed to buy any souvenirs, so I had to go back through to look for the basics, which were not hard to find. I also bought a lot of artisan goods instead of the usual ""I heart Korea"" key chains, because there were so many cool shops!Craft stalls were set up on the streets and I bought a lot of ""souvenirs"" here instead. Hey, it may not say Korea all over it, but I am not good at buying tacky remembrances. And besides, the crafters had really awesome things, like handmade bags and wooden games, etc.Warning: If you see a food stall with a big pot simmering with bugs, your eyes are not deceiving you. Cover your nose or be prepared to lose your lunch. Ugh!Check it out, even if it's not your cup of tea. You may be pleasantly surprised!"
Charming and lively,"I walked through the street and found it had many authentic looking,little stores and character, which many of the subterranean malls lack. I would definitely recommend this."
quaint little street,it's a very cute little street with ceramic shops along. if you go inside the allies there are a lot of surprise waiting for you to discover！
A charming little street!!,The walk into Insa-dong from the metro station was quite fascinating. The street has this warm & cozy feeling to it. There are souvenir shops on both sides of the road.I did a fair bit of Souvenir shoppping @ the National Souvenir Centre. The staff can be intrusive & overbearing. The pricing is also on the higher side when compared with smaller stores/shops.I shopped at another store whose name i have now forgotten :-)The lady who attended to me was very courteous. All the merchandise that i bought @ the store was beautifully gift-wrapped.Even if you don't intend to go shopping you must visit Insa-dong to enjoy the walk down the narrow street. There are plenty of restaurant & street stalls should you get hungry/thirsty.
Give yourself plenty of time,"Lots of stores selling same things over and over. The souvenir kitsch isn't necessarily cheaper. Plenty of street food to try here. Prepare for crowds, mainly tourists."
"Art, culture & food all in one street","Great place to walk and appreciate art. Of course, not discounting shopping! Food is everywhere and delish!"
The place to be,"Amazing place, full of life. People, culture, local food and what not. Not to be msised at any cost when in Seoul."
Always worthy of a few lingering hours,I always visit Insadong when in Seoul and enjoy looking at the wide range of Korean souvenirs available. The place is just so relaxing and nice to stop for drinking tea.Tip: be brave and go venturing into those small eating house in the back lanes where the locals eat. Food is good!
Great people watching!,"Clearly a tourist area, but still nicely set up with lots going on. Of course shopping -- but also a number of galleries and interesting street food (including singing vendors). "
Great cultural place,"We stayed close to this place, lots of arts and crafts. Lots of restaurants around to choose from. Highly recommended."
A nice place to stroll around at night,"The nearest subway station is Anguk station.This place is filled with tourists from different countries. Here they have many shops selling things from shirts, shoes, souvenirs, to many different kinds of food, including the interesting Korean honey string candy. There is a shopping complex called Ssamziegil, where you can find plenty of hand-made crafts, accessories, and souvenirs. This building is special in a way that it looks artistic and with unique design. "
Fun place for shopping and snacks,"This market area is a mix of small shops with actual doors/walls plus some outside stalls...also coffee shops, cafes/restaurants, art galleries...and push cart snacks. Some of the restaurants are down narrow alleyways. Great place to spend a few hours to see & be seen...definitely attracts tourists & locals, alike. Items for sale include trinkets and souvenirs to higher priced items. If you want to visit a market area while in Seoul, I would recommend this one."
Great atmosphere,"I went to Insa-dong on a weekend evening in Autumn and I really loved the vibe of this place - buzzing crowds, street food, markets, good restaurants and teahouses. We enjoyed trying snacks such as the sugar filled pancakes and the traditional court cakes. We had dinner at Tobang which was delicious and very popular - it's not that easy to find but it's next to a building with some trees out the front and has a white sign with black chinese characters. Most amusing was that there were two guys employed to stand around looking for lost-looking English speakers and offering help!"
Walking street for weekenders,easy location to go. Plenty of restaurant and tourist shop of local arts and souvenirs. No car so pleasant street to cross. At every season different colors
Interesting.,"For any tourist who visits seoul, this is the place to go for souvenirs, arts, craft and some traditional foods. You will meet loads of tourist both local and foreigners, scouting and combing the streets of insadong looking for something korean. Its nice to be here, its the atmosphere.During our 3 day stay, we actually visited insadong twice and kept ourselves busy browsing and picking up korean gifts. Not much bargaining can be done here, do not know if it a trend 'not to bargain' in seoul, most of the stall owners just looked at us in surprised and shook their heads...English is not well spoken, not widely spoken and communication can be difficult. Some one did write that the younger generation koreans do speak english, I find this not true. Anyway we got thru and had a real good vacation."
The Never Ending Streets of Delight,"Insa-dong is one of the popular districts in South Korea. I would say it is the best place to get souvenirs to bring back home. It is basically a very long street that has many mini alleys connected to it. There are dozens of shops selling traditional and cultural items such as artwork, art supplies, antiques, and handmade goodies. For those who are very for into k-pop music there are shops that sell the artist's posters, calendar, socks, everything a fan could ever want. The food in Insa-dong are quite pricey but the restaurants are very nice. A dish per person is probably going to be $20 and up converting from Korean wons to dollars. I would suggest eating somewhere else before going there. However, I would suggest to check out the bakeries and little cafe if you want a snack or to relax and grab a drink with friends. What I like best are the little shops especially the ones selling this delicious treat called honey string candy. It is a traditional Korean candy made of 16,000 strands of honey, malt and ground nuts (inside filling). The sellers/makers are very animated and sing songs and make jokes. It is a very entertaining must see thing when you go to Korea. The worst thing is if you need to use the restaurant there aren't places to go unless you are going in to places to eat or drink. In Asia people are not very nice about letting you use the restroom unless your buying something from them. Be prepared to shop for a good 2-3 hours because there is a lot to see and shop for. If you are planning to eat add another hour. Wear comfy shoes and bring a camera!"
Do you know insadong?,"Do you know 'In sa-dong'? Insa-dong is the favorite tourist attraction for foreigner and it is known for has a lot of Korean history and tradition. A visit to Seoul isn’t complete until you’ve seen Insadong. Insadong is always full of people like couples, familys regardless of their nationality or age. Insadong was once a residential area for palace officials, royal families, and yangban classes but this is now has a lot of Korean culture, art, performance, exbition, shop. Especially, The traditional merchandises that contain the original beauty of Korea are one of the reasons why foreigners visit Korea. Moreover, the signs are written in Korean letters. If you visit In-SaDong, one of the places you must go is the ""SSAM JI GIL"" or the Sam Ji Street.Beautiful Interior of many bulidings and streets that are decorated with Korean letter are unique but also contain many products of special artists that are attractive. Also, there are not only many kinds of spectacle , but also you can experience many Korean tradition such as Korean traditional wedding. Insadong will keep trying to minimize of inconvenience of foreigners, so they are getting ready for 'U Insadong service' using ubiquitous computing technology. I hope you love it. If you come to Insadong, you should find old-world traditional teahouse and small shop where selling Hanji, it will be special experience like treasure hunt."
Traditional,Insa -dong is synonymous to traditional. I would like to suggest to travelers to go around the building in a clockwise direction starting from the ground floor and capping it with coffee on the top floor. Each shop sells unique Korean items.
Traditional music and relaxation in Insadong,"After long walk through busy Insadong I found some place to have a break. The name of the place is Habit Wellness&Coulture lounge. Each week on Wed, Thu, Fri there is a concert performed by traditional Korean instruments. I had a nice time and relaxed. But it is not only about music! Also you can try breathing meditation accompanied by Kayagum solo. It was really refreshing. I had a lot of positive emotions. If you don't speak Korean there is personnel with whom you can talk to in English and also in Japanese language ^ ^. Ticket price is only 10 000 WonSnacks and tea after the concert are also included ^_^The concerts are performed on Wed, Thu, Fri each week. Time: 2 pm - 3 pmAddress: 3&4th Fl., Anguk Bldg. New Tower, 175-3 Anguk-Dong, (Take Subway Line 3 to Anguk Station, Exit 1.) Jongro-Gu, SeoulPS: For advanced visitors looking for new experience who have more time. On the 3d floor there is a Tea House and Kooksondo (Korean Yoga) practice lounge, where you can prolong your relaxation also improve your health.I tried several times and even basic stretching is helpful to keep body in tonus. While the meditation helped me to get rid from all my troubles for a while and focus more on good things. Ok! this is my personal stuff . You are welcome to have your own experience."
beware buying from the national souvenir centre 15 insa-Dong Seoul,Bought two lovely hand made table light for my wife's 50th birthday gift at circa £200 and paid for tracked delivery to UK.9 months on no lights! and no response to phone calls and emails.Unfortunately paid cash so no comeback via credit card company.A Korean friend has spoken to the owner in his own language and he promised delivery - hooray! Months later - still no lights :((
"Souvenirs, Knick-Knacks, Stroll, Cultural","This area just reminds me of areas specifically selling Souvenirs, if you are looking for things to guy as gifts, or whatever this is the place you should probably go. It is about a 15=20 minute walk or so from the subway station. Sorry I forgot which one, but it's in all the maps I think.This place has lots of people, even locals. They sell everything. We tried the mountain banana, honestly it's a little bit of a waste of money, there are so many seeds in them that you cannot really eat any of the fruit. The fruit doesn't really have any taste either.There are shops selling all sorts of different cultural things. If you like souvenir shopping I think whatever you want you will be able to find it here. You will need about 2 hours to from subway station to subway station to finish the area if you don't go in and out of too many stores.On the main street of the subway is where the Institute of Korean Food is located. It is not the same street as the Insa-dong shopping area is. This street is where the subway is. It's about a 10 minute walk I think. We went inside as there is a small museum there, I forgot if we had to pay or not, I think at most it was like 1000won. It's small, you can finish the whole thing in about 10-30 minutes. Next to the museum there is a resturant, we didn't eat there as the food was pricey. Overall an interesting place to visit."
A good place for shopping!,I went there 3 times and I really enjoyed it. I went to Ssamziegil. The building full of local shops esp i bought some handmade natural soaps from a shop at Ssamziegil. Checked out for green tea icecream :)
Worth spending an hour or two,"Quite interesting place, lots of somewhat unusual shops. Quite nice for a little walk."
Souvenirs haven for tourist.,"I'd say this is one of my fave place in Seoul. The street is lined up with shops & stalls selling antiques, souvenirs, ascessories, artsy stuff, cafe, etc. Once you're here, don't forget to go to Ssamziegil, it's a nice little complex with lots of traditional korean stuff. If you are going to buy souvenirs here, shops around and bargain. The price is different btw shops."
A hidden gem within a hidden gem!,"We went to Insa-dong with not-so-high expectations as we knew it was mostly for shoppers, but we were pleasantly surprised with this big building we found (can't remember the name unfortunately) that housed dozens of small shops including a big anchor store: Ssamzie Market. We made our way to the top of the building where we had a refreshing ice cold Cass draft beer al fresco style, and Korean BBQ dinner after. If you visit Insa-dong, this is one place you should not skip."
Good old days & old fashion,"I can say that this is The Right place where you can enjoy everything about traditional Korea such as food, cloth, pottery etc. Lots of Korean restaurants and cafes serve various traditional food, drink and desert. Insadong is also famous for art galleries. Starbucks café in Insadong is the only one in the world its signboard is named as Korean."
A lively gem,"Insadong is a charming, pedestrianized street lined with typical tourist shops and several genuinely interesting galleries. The architecture is a fascinating mixture of well-preserved (in a few cases, over-preserved) old Korean with modernism. A particular highlight is the Ssamziegil center, one of the most successful modernist buildings in the area, chock full of small shops, a few cafes, several good restaurants (one in the basement specializes in bibimbap and was especially good), and crowded with people even in the current economy. Outside, the wandering alleys are filled with restaurants and still more shops and galleries."
"Antique shops, traditional restaurants, and souvenirs galore","Insa-dong is a very special place in Seoul. The antique shops are lovely and loaded with unique items, but unless you're well informed on purchasing Asian antiques, I'd recommend skipping the investment on an antique. The souvenir shops have plenty to offer, but are way more pricey compared to the bargains that can be found in Namdaemun Market. If you're coming here for lunch or dinner expect to pay a bit more than in other areas in Seoul, but - rest assured - you'll get your money's worth. I recommend diverting from the main strip of Insadongil and heading into the winding alleys to seek out a diamond in the rough. Some of the best traditional Korean restaurants are on these winding alleys, as are other types of cuisine like: Italian, Indian, Thai, and so on. Insa-dong is more of a must-see sight for its' distinct character rather than for being a place to drop several thousand Korean won on knick knacks. As for eating a nice dinner, this is the place to go."
Mostly For Shoppers,On my first day in Korea I used the Seoul City Tour Bus to get to Insa-dong and walked around the main street in about 1 hour. I'm not much of a shopper but it was interesting to see the various furniture/antique shops and little stores selling this and that. It was good for a morning of looking around but the other markets are larger and probably have better deals.In my limited travel experience I have never thought of alleys as a good place to be since things can get shady very quickly if you don't know the area. However in Korea there are tons of little streets & alleys off the main streets and they're full of shops/restaurants. To get the full enjoyment of Insa-dong or anywhere in Seoul you have to go into the alleys. Be aware though that the streets in Korea are poorly labeled and maze-like and you can get lost pretty easily.
Enjoy yourself in insa-dong,"If you visit Seoul, I think you should visit Insa-dong.There are many kinds of things to see such as traditional an art gallery, a Korean clothes gallery, traditional teahouses and so on.If you are interested in your fortune, you can find out about your fortune. While you are there, you can have a cup of tea free charge and you can read many kinds of books to your satisfaction.And you should probably go to Ssamzie Road. There are many shopping malls. So you can browse through objects that are pretty diverse and cheap. You can take a picture with them. So you ought to pack your camera. You are going to be hungry because you walked a lot.Why don't you eat Korean food? Maybe you should eat beanpaste soup or noodle soup with mixde sea foods or grilled fish.And then I recommend wheat -gluten with your dessert. You feel so sweet. Be sure to watch them make it.You will be surprised how they do it. I hope you have a nice travel."
Fun place for a stroll,"Insadong was a fun place for a weekend afternoon stroll. LOTS of people here, lots of activity. Many stores selling crafts, from cheap to high quality. Wide selection, great prices everywhere. There is the National souviner Center, and other large places for quality Korean gifts and crafts. Many boutiques, art galleries etc. Lots of street food for sale, looked good. It's near Tagpol Park, in Central Seoul. For those interested, there is a McDonald's near the subway station entrance, about 7 minutes away."
