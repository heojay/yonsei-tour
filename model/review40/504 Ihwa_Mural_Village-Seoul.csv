Delightful way to spend an hour,"There weren't so many murals but the neighborhood itself was delightful and sweet to explore. If you have an hour to spend, this would be a great place to go."
Funky local art spot!,"My husband and I decided to head out to Ihwa Mural Village early Saturday morning. We followed the directions found on a few different websites to get there. First things first...it's a good hike up the hill to get to the murals. Wear comfortable shoes! If you have small children just know that it is a walk and that there are even more stairs once you get in to the mural village area itself. Having read a bit about the mural village before going, I knew that a couple of the iconic pieces had been painted over. While sad, there are still more than enough murals to take in that we were not disappointed. The route up to the top and around Iowa Mural Village was well signed and helpful. Some of the murals are a bit generic but there remained enough along the loop, which took us along the Seoul Fortress Wall for a spell, to keep us entertained. There were a number of cafes with great views of Seoul. We enjoyed our visit and would recommend this to people who have explored all the standard sights of Seoul and are looking to branch out to see things off the beaten path."
Nice walk,"I stumbled upon this village almost by mistake after hiking along the Seoul Wall. It’s a great walk up and you can include a visit to the Wall Museum, which is interesting and entrance is free. The village itself is just a good place to wonder around and explore some is the small shops, galleries or just look at the street art. Good for photographers."
Disappointing,"Some of the locals were fed up with the visitors so they painted over the more famous murals, Some of them are very childish and obviously painted by amateurs."
Nice and cute place,"It's nice to walk around! Be prepared to face some big stairs though.Also, it's not that big so you'll be finished in no time"
Beautiful art,"We stumbled across this village as we were walking to our next destination and saw some really beautiful wall art. A really lovely little stumble, even in the rain!"
Not great for toddlers and preschoolers ,"There are a series of hills to get to the village from the information center and then a series of steep stairs throughout the mural route that would make it difficult for families with small children to complete the tour. We ended up staying on the lower loop and only seeing about half of the murals because the kids were so tired of climbing the hills to get to the town (before we even reached all of the stairs). There’s also a map of the route available at the information center near exit two of 생화 subway stop. The guide told us we could do the tour in an hour with kids but if you’re walking from the information center, 1.5-2 hours might be more realistic without them. "
Interesting murals,"While searching the web for places to explore in Seoul, I chanced upon this interesting village and decided to make a trip here. As expected, there are many murals of colourful designs spread over the village or rather a town. There are signs recommending a specific route and murals to look out for.Visitors are reminded to keep their voices down and the place clean when visiting this place in considerations of the residents living there. Apparently they were so upset with the noises that they disfigured the flowers and koi fishes mosaic on the staircases."
Super fun afternoon stroll!,"This was a super unique experience in Seoul! I loved the opportunity to wander aimlessly, and discover lots of interesting shops and views! The street art is fun and offers great opportunities for social media posts. "
Awesome trip up to Ihwa Mural Village!,"Loving the trip up to this quaint little village. One of the highlights of our 9D8N trip. Interesting shops around for browsing around. Hubby even bought 2*shirts for KRW10,000! Highly recommended if you want a day out of Seoul city."
Really nice,"I really liked walking around here. There is lots to see and it wasn't crowded at all, even though I was there on a Sunday afternoon. Be aware that some parts are very steep."
Art village,"Good for photo. Lots of handicraft shops. Have some cafe for drink, snack and sit for a while. Morning or early afternoon time reccommend. "
a break from all the shopping and commercial city,"It is an area within a village that is full of art murals. Can take many photos and enjoy a cup of coffee there. There are also a few cafes/ restaurants you can choose from, though quite pricey compared to the rest of the restaurants in Seoul. It is in a neighbourhood that required some stairs/steep walking, so take that into consideration. Also try to be quiet when visiting =)"
A break from the crowded city Centre,"Be prepared, a bit hectic to walk up the steep hill slope. If you like arts - this is a relax care free place to go. You can look around the murals scattered on the small houses along the hilly alleys. The small cafes around the area are decorated with individual art tastes. You can take a cup of coffee or beer to enjoy the specific city view from the hill. A fun experience."
"Very cool, feels like somewhere in Europe","Sick of palaces? Then this is a different, good 2-3 hour activity that you can do without a tour guide. Requires an average level of fitness; quite steep.Very cool part of Seoul that has a number of pokey cafes from which you can view the city and have a coffee or beer.The murals themselves are pretty good, but they could do with more. There is plenty more space to be utilised."
classic korean alleys!,"i am glad that i did not miss this in my itinerary. even though the murals are not as many as i expected (one of the main mural of goldfish on the staircases are gone), but i like the walk up the alleys, to experience what i've seen in many korean dramas (houses in the small hilly alleys).the was no signboards/directions from Hyehwa station to go Ihwa Mural Village.. i just used Kakao map. really recommended if you are up for a hike, otherwise, don't try it ^_^"
Lovely theme,"I had a good time in Ihwa Village. The place is very cute, u can easily rent some uniform for your photos, and the price is very cheap"
Peaceful Village to have some nice photos,It is a very peaceful village located in Seoul. There are many murals which you can take a photo with. My favorite mural is the wing painting. The village has many stairs so make sure that you are in a fit condition when going there.
Good place to spend a nice day,"Well, the murals may not be as many as it used to be but it was still good to take that stroll up the slope towards Naksan Park. Nice cafe and little eateries as you go mural hunting. Milk Gonghang is a nice place to stop for ice-cream and coffee. "
Not as vibrant as I imagined,Not a lot to see anymore. I understand that some artworks were painted over. Might have been a mistake to visit Gamcheon Cultural Village first since we couldn't help but compare.
Bohemian Ihwa Mural Village,"Ihwa Mural Village (이화동벽화마을) perched at the top of Naksan Park, was once set for demolition as it was seen as a poor and down-trodden neighbourhood. In 2006 under the “Art in City Project” carried out by The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, murals were painted to revitalize the area. Brightly coloured murals on walls, fences and rooftops were created by 70 artists to transform it into a charming and photogenic village. The Mural Village illustrates the ability of street art and human ties to breathe new life to the city. Many small museums, art centers and cafés have also sprung up to add to the bohemian feel. As one mural-hunt, remember that this is a place where people live and the daily lifestyle of residents should be respected. So, please don't intrude."
A steep climb but nice murals,"The climb is steep and long but you Will be rewarded with nice murals and view OF The City. The houses are unique and The murals are varied in theme. There are photos OF The place displayed hanging by some OF The walls. The locals are nice and welcoming. There are café and drinking places with nice balconies at The TOP. A good place to relax, drink and eat."
Flourishing Colors,"Who will not be captivated with Street Art? But this small community in Seoul is a priceless gem of all for me. I love walking on every alleys of this community because every steps I take is another art. Installation, mural, photography, wrought metal art and seeing a fantastic view of the city!"
"Beautiful views, fun art, funky neighbourhood.","The views alone are worth the walk up the hillside roads to Ihwa Mural Village. It was 48 degrees C with the humidex the day we walked up to the village in Seoul and we were pleased we made the trek. The little area is quite charming and boasts some stunning views of the city. The quirky murals that dot the area are fun to see. This is NOT, however, a place for someone with mobility issues as there are many stairs, a steep incline throughout, and many uneven surfaces. "
Very Disappointing ,"Looking from the past review, we thought there will be more mural paintings to see. But they are all either already faded away or badly painted over. Not worth going at all. Don’t waste your time. "
Disappointing ,"Was looking forward to the village as had seen some pictures. Sadly the famous stuff like the steps were covered over. It's a bit of a climb to the top and kdrama fans can see Strong Woman Do Bong Soon's house which is apparently a museum but looked like a shop. It's also close to Naksan Park which is worth a look. Though there was some interesting art work, it was nothing special and really uninspiring compared to Gamcheon culture village in Busan (where visitors actually seemed to be welcome). We had some yummy milk ice cream at Milk Gongbang which was a cute little place. "
Visitors were not welcomed!,It was my first time visiting this neighbourhood and I was shocked at all the messages doodled in red paint by the residents of the area saying “Please be quiet” and “I wan’t to live” etcetc. It can be seen that the residents hate to see tourists there for obvious reasons. Read on blogs that some murals were removed by the residents there as they could not take it anymore and witnessed some being covered by paint.If you’re looking to go to this place just remember to be respectful. The place is located about 1km away from DDM and is on a hill - some routes are very very steep slopes so be careful. You can walk to Naksan Park as well since they are side by side.
arty Village,In downtown Located nearby the former city fence wall ITVs a real pleasant placeThere is some shops and cafes and you should go up and down and follow your instinct in order to collect the beautiful pictures about street artIt s so nice even with childrenYou can play on it !
Famous Murals Are Gone,"We made this a must-see on our second trip to Seoul. It is not an easy place to find - it took us an hour to get to it.The reason that we wanted to visit this Village was the artwork, especially the stairs with fish and sunflowers. Unfortunately, they were gone as we think the local people painted over them (so that outsiders would not come?).We were able to find a few other mural paintings, but not all. We wished that the Village would keep up the murals as they are what makes the Village, regardless of outsiders or not.One advice - getting to the Village requires a lot of walking uphills and up LOTS of stairs. It is a good exercise but not for everyone."
Nice quaint place worth a stroll,"Although some of the artworks are removed, it is still worth a trip there.Totally understand how frustrating it could be for the residents there with the noises from the tourists.Would be good to bear in mind to be considerate and dont talk too loudly.Coffee and ice-cream at Milk GongBang is worth trying but staff there could work on to be a little friendly."
Just for a stroll,We went to see the Ihwa Mural village to see the more known wall paintings. Apparently local people had painted over the the better known painting of fishes at the staircase. This was a bit of disappointment. The rest is so-so but you can enjoy a drink at some of the roof terraces to get a good view.
Unique Village,The village located at the top of the hill near by Naksan park. It has a beautiful art wall around the village.
Worth a visit,"This place is hilly, so need comfortable walking shoes. Many interesting murals on walls which capture nice photos. There are also many small cafes & shops. I went in the morning & is a quiet neighbourhood & not very crowded.It’s a nice break from the shopping & eating.There is a Naksan Park nearby & noticed that the locals go for hiking. "
"Such a cool, artsy neighborhood off the beaten path","Not many visitors to Seoul know about this cool, indie neighborhood not far from Changdeokgung Palace, Bukchon, and Dongdaemun. It's a very hilly residential area where artists have decorated many walls and stairways with cool paintings and mosaics. There are so many cute boutiques, restaurants, and cafes sprinkled throughout the area, you could easily spend all day wandering around. Everything is super Instagramable! If you have mobility issues or young children in tow, the hills may be too much, but for everyone else it makes a great day out - just wear your walking shoes!"
Definitely Love and will miss this place,Found this place through some travel apps.Glad that it is not crowded and you can enjoy your photo shooting here :)Very nice and relaxing place with a lot of nice Café. It is also known for Korean Drama filming place - such as The Rooftop Prince.
Hidden gem of Seoul Tour,"Even many Seoul dwellers don't know this place. It has lovely cafeterias and tiny shops.- Locating on a hill, seniors may have some difficulties.- Accessible from Daehakro(metro: Hyehwa) and Dongdaemun City Wall Park(metro: Dongdaemun History & Culture Park).- There's Naksan Park with a nice view behind. Good to visit together."
Its good to be back Seoul again,It was our 3rd visit & this yr we visited Ihwa Mural Village since the first 2 night we stayed in Dongdaemun before we moved to Insadong.After get out from the exit there is maybe exhibition hall then many shops all along the way to the village.We have to walk up the hill until the end.I love this area because many cafes & beautiful place.
Nice!,"There are lots of nice murals here. They are located in different places, and not in one street. Two of the murals are no longer in existence as they were painted over. There are cafes.. quaint cafes all around! Really nice! There is also a souvenir shop, with a red scooter outside as props. Lots of nice costume jewellery there. Awesome service too. As you walk, do keep your voices down. It is a residential estate. I have attached on the directions i used. Basically, just walk towards Naksan Park. You will see it.There are awesome view at the top of the village."
Something different ,My family chanced upon this interesting mural village while we were tracking our way up the Seoul City Wall trail. The murals added colours and uniqueness to this quite village. We spent about an hour walking around the village enjoying the murals and some local snack and ice cream. Recommendation : 1. an hour walkabout will be sufficient to see the place. 2. Wear comfortable shoes as there are slopes and many staircases to climb. 3. Go there if only you are interested in something different instead of the normal common touristy places. 
"Nice, but you can skip it for other attraction","for k-drama lover, this place is a must visit. You can find some drama shooting location here such as BongSun house from drama Strong Women Do Bongsun. The pictures also nice, but there are some pictures that has been deleted. And please noted, this is some neighbourhood area so you can not disturb people who live there by speak loudly. There even some old lady who seat in the street and holding a sign ""please speak quietly""."
Very beautiful wall murals and nice view of Seoul at the top!,"It is tough walking upslope but you can take many nice pictures along the way, the murals on the walls are really beautiful!There are many couples and students and you can try talking to them to get a taste of the locals!At the top are a few cafe where you can sip your beer or coffee, and see the sunset, across the city!Strongly recommend for travellers who want a different kind of feeling when in Seoul )beside all the shopping and eating)!"
"Nice, but not worth a trip if short on time","We dropped by Ihwa Mural Village after the hike up to Naksan Park (which was nice and quiet, but the view of Seoul that it offers isn't anything astounding). There were some nice murals in the village, but overall, it seems quite run down. It's worth noting that two of the more popular murals you might see online (the koi and flower murals on the staircases) were painted over by locals last year, so it was a bit disappointing.I wouldn't recommend it for a short visit to Seoul as there are other places that might be more worth your time. If you do plan to go though, come in comfortable shoes as it's around a 20 minute walk uphill from the train station. There are a few coffee shops in the area if you plan to stay a bit longer and enjoy the place."
Definitely Worth A visit - 真的值得一訪,"We were here for about two hours. We enjoyed the quietness & the unique beauty of this area. Definitely, the art presentation / paintings of the area are curing & facilitating your photo shooting a lot. We liked the milk shop & another small cafe for the drink & interior design they provided. In the end of the walk, we all agreed this is a very nice place to hangout for two or three hours...我們在這裡待了兩小時，我們很享受這裡的安靜和特別的風味，特別是這裡的壁畫和藝術呈現都很療癒，而且無法停止拍照，我們在牛奶工房和另一家小咖啡店都很享受她的飲料和舒服的裝潢，在離開這一區時我們都同意這區很適合來逛逛、照照、發呆個兩三個小時。"
Great for art and hiking lovers!,"This place is like the Gamcheon Mural Village in Seoul. It's not as artsy as Gamcheon but it's quite good with beautiful paintings and art landmarks. You need to hike to see the fullest. They have maps that show special paintings or landmarks of the village. Special or you can say beautiful landmarks located at a high level so get ready for a long hike. At the top of the mountain (just like Gamcheon, Ihwa is located at Mt. Naksan) you can find part of Seoul City Wall as the wall also cross the Mt. Naksan, Seoul city, and DDP from afar. There are cafes, small souvenirs shops, some street food stalls, and hanbok rental shops. You can buy a cup of coffee to enter one of the cafes and enjoy the view from the balcony."
Mural needs a bit of restoration,There is alot of stairs to go up if you want to reach the village.Most of the murals needs a bit of restoration. But it was worth it to walk up to the village to take the pictures with the murals.Would recommend it for couples or close friends.Or k-drama lovers.
Nice find along the wall,"Ihwa Mural Village is located 3/4 of the way up the Seoul city wall. It is a great spot to stop, get a coffee or a snack and snap a few pictures of the fun murals! There are maps on buildings that will show you were each mural is located throughout the village."
nice but takes a hike to get here,"Ihwa mural village is located near Naksan park, you have to get thru the park to get to the village... be prepared to walk a lot. The popular murals like the fish and flower staircase are no longer there. It's covered with grey paint now. A pity. The whole area was quite interesting to look at, with little cafes and shops around. Not bad if you have time.. but we found gamcheon culture village in Busan more attractive."
Causal walk around the art village,"The area is cozy. Wall paints can be found in the whole area. Don't expect too much, it is not designed for tourists; people do live there. That's the reasons they removed the famous painting on one of the staircases.A side note, there is a ice cream store, called ""Milk GongBang"". The milk ice cream there is excellent!"
Nothing special,"The visit was dissapointing because best murals, which were on stairs, are no longer available. There are much better places to see in Seoul."
Climb climb climb,It's a bit of a climb to get to the nice staircase murals and the artwork is interesting but the trickeye museum is more worth your time. Mural village is free and you get the exercise but don't bring a stroller if you have kids. Also don't talk too loud as people actually live in this village. 
Feel art on thw village,"First time to go there. Not hard to find this placeThere is obvious direction so i think you can find it well ^^If you wanna go here, i recommend to use comfort shoes like sneaker because we need to climb. And bring mineral water because you will need itThis good place to take picture or just wanna feel fresh air and enjoy the view "
Mural Village,This place is really amazing! Great for people that loves art and likes to work out. Good views of Seoul can be seen while you go up the village. The City Wall is around as well. Lots of coffee shops and souvenirs can be found as well. One of the best spots to take pictures in all Seoul
traditional atmosphere ,"A little bit far from the center of Seoul. But this place is definitely good. I was really impressed by Korean traditional atmosphere. And there're many people who enjoy wearing Korean traditional attire. Architecture, people, local restaurant, many things are so attractive here."
Lots of stairs,Not recommended for them who brings young children and elderly. Lots of stairs to climb and it will be a little tiring.. but overall it was good. The atmosphere was nice and there are some souvenir shops and cafes. 
Ihwa Mural Village,"It was so cold in Seoul when we visited but this place warmed up our hearts. Inspiring and uplifting Ihwa Mural Village to walk, take photos, enjoy the views."
Artistic beauty and a healthy body,"There are many murals drawn on the sides of people's houses. As the name says, it is a village. Therefore be sure to keep quiet when exploring the area. There is also some mini workshops, cafes and museums around the village, The village is also situated at Naksan Mountain, so make sure to wear proper footwear and clothing as there will be a hike up to the village and high stairs along the village"
Nice murals and art installations in a local neighbourhood ,"We were here on the 1st day of Seollal. Most shops were close. The neighbourhood is quiet eventhough there were tourists or visitors like us walking around admiring the neighbourhood and its creative surroundings. There were many graphics, wall arts and at installations worth admiring and taking photos with. A few cafes with free wifi were opened when we were there so we had no problem having a good lunch at a nice warm place. We even get to eat hot sweet potatoes while walking up the neighbourhood. Walking around this area, you will experience and get to see how the working class in Korea used to live in the older days. If you are interested to stay within this area, there is a guest house - Rose & Candy Guesthouse with a View. I did not see the interior but u can check them out by calling 010 8828 3720. According to one flea market seller we met, on normal days (non-holidays and especially weekend), there will be many sellers there selling accesories and artistic pieces. The view - once you are at the highest point of the village is really nice. You should bring a good camera when you are here and put on good shoes as the steps are old grounds so they are not flat and smooth. There are many slopes and uneven ground so be careful when walking. Important thing to note is this is a local neighbourhood. It is a residential area. So walk quietly and do not make noise or litter the area. It is a public place so respect the environment."
Cute murals!,"My sister and I visited the mural village after reading a blog about how cute these murals are decorated around the neighborhood. We walked around the village and took some pictures with cute murals. We kind of expected to see more around the neighborhood but maybe it was just us not looking closely enough. We didn't see many tourists since we went in the morning but we did see a few. As I was walking around, I started to feel bad for the people that live there since they don't get much privacy. There are constantly strangers walking around the neighborhood and taking pictures. I guess they're used to it but I would get annoyed if it got loud with visitors. My sister and I left right after we realized this is where people actually live and should be respectful of their space. Try to keep the volume low and be respectful of their property. :)"
Ihwa Mural Village,"A place that has many many spots for great pics. Due to some local protests, its famous painted staircases are covered with cement. However, there are still many beautiful hand painting to look at. Be more willing to walk more and explore the area wider than usual - is worth it. "
Cute!,"Cute place to spend an afternoon. There were not as many murals as I had expected, but there were some really nice ones. Fun to watch all of the local tourists taking loads of selfies. Lots of cute cafes & shops throughout the village. Some nice views of the city from nearby as well. Great way to spend a few hours!"
Walk to the top for awesome view!,"This place is easy to reach by bus or subway and nice to visit in the morning.If you walk to the village in early morning, sometimes you might catch the fog and feels like you're walking between the clouds!I walked to the top of the village (hike for a bit, about 30-45mins), but the view is worth it!When you reached the top, there's a small playground nearby and you can stop by to take a picture from that place.The view from the top is quite similar with Gamcheon Village in Busan; the difference is just the buildings are not painted in colors.If you love seeing the arts, mural on the wall or unique graffiti, then I will recommend this place to you."
Average,"We visited today and it was enjoyable but... they repainted their two special ""mural attractions"" which are the fishes and the floral ceramic design .. for ""rebuilding"" but totally could repair their stairs (which aren't broken) without wasting it all. We were a bit upset since we saw the photos beforehand and were really excited. Otherwise nice for a early morning walk without too many selfie takers so you get nice shots. Also very walkable distance to bukchon traditional village, couldn't find walking time and distance on google maps but seriously is 30 mins and good way to explore the community."
Gone and never back again,"This used to be a really nice little village to walk through, with many colourful and interesting murals to look at at every corner, where even the electricity and water meters would be decorated. Many tourists would come here to take photos and leave with great memories and even better photos!However, when I visited this place in October, most of the murals were gone. Those that remained, they were barely there either, and the village that was once popular with tourists is now almost like a ghost town. It was very disappointing to see this mural village go, perhaps because too many tourists were swarming the place and disrupting the lives of the residents.Don't go there. It's not worth the visit anymore."
Beautiful!,"Well worth the climb. Plenty of cute art pieces and cafes. On the way to the village, you can get a great view of Seoul. I went around sunset and it was spectacular!"
Not bad,Lots of uphill and downhill routes. You may think twice if you are travelling with children or elderly. Wear sport shoes for this attraction. Nice view from the peak.
Creative!,A creative way to express the culture of korean people. Peaceful village with cute drawings. But we need to climb ub a bit to reach the village and quiet far from the subway station
Nice neighborhood,"Ihwa Mural Village has a bunch of beautiful drawings, and the drawings painted on wall or even stairs. But it's so sad that some of those drawings been erased due to some conflicts between the people who live there. In fact there are actual people and family live in there, so when it becomes famous alot of tourists come and go and it makes the neighborhood become crowded, and some of the tourists just easily go inside the house because they don't know there's a family who live there. So for you who still want to go here, please pay attention not to make noise while you're walk around and enjoying the neighborhood ;)"
Ihwa Mural Village,"I searched a lot of information about korean scenery spots when I planning go to Korea. Therefore, I found Korean Mural Village is the most famous and special. Ihwa Mural Village is the best wall painting. I really looked forward going to there.  When I got off from subway, the place was hard to find. Asked some passerby, they all nice to tell me how to go to the mural village. However, I felt a little bit disappointed that the goldfish stairs and flower stairs were painted over with grey paint. It is said that local residents felt angry because tourists were so noisy. They said tourists disturb their life. Although there are some beautiful paintings were gone, it is also worth to visit. There are many kinds of wall paintings, they made the village become more colorful and full of vigor.  If you want to go to the Ihwa Mural Village to take a visit, please speak whispered and respect to the residents."
Beautiful,I came to Ihwa with my friends. We walk for about 700m I think? Along the way we can see some clothing store and resto/cafe. The location is on top of the hill so we can see the beautiful scenery. The mural was great and i met an old lady who owns mini store and she was so friendly!
Prepare your feet,"Bear with the steep road and long walking distance. but it worth a visit. Unfortunately during my time went there, the mural of carp fish on the stairs is not there anymore. probably they want to change the design. or or or maybe i the one who didn't find it. and some of the spot of this place is once drama shooting location. I enjoyed my time here as i also be able to watched seoul scenery from the top.Cool!"
Nice Place to Visit on a Monday,"With most tourist attractions and museums in Seoul closed on Monday, this might be a good alternative if you want to get out and explore the city. I reached it from the Dongdaemun area walking along the Old City Wall heading toward Naksan Park. While it is an uphill climb, to me it looked easier than the people arriving at Ihwa from below and having to traverse many steps. As others have posted the two most well known murals painted on the staircases were vandalized and are no longer visible, which is really a shame. There are some smaller murals and other sculptures like cats, roosters, and balloons that were fun to look at. The view over Seoul also is nice with Namsan tower in the background. There were a few shops, coffee houses, and restaurants too, although I really didn't stop at any of them except for one shop that also had a small museum that while closed the proprietor allowed me to take a look--that is where I saw what the destroyed murals (one of fish the other flowers) looked like. Ihwa is a bit like the Gamcheon Culture Village in Busan but on a much smaller scale. Right next to Ihwa is Naksan Park and I enjoyed the tranquility of the paths there as well as the city views and the views of the old city wall. Altogether I probably spent about two hours exploring and taking pictures of both Ihwa and Naksan and would recommend this as something different to do in Seoul and a bit off the beaten path."
Great stroll,"Although it's quite a steep walk up the hill, it's worth the fantastic view, tons of nice little cafés/bars sipping on a drink/coffee while watching busy Seoul..."
Picture time,"Although its high up there on the top of the mountain and its summer, which means you have to sweat all the way up to the village, It's quite a nice place to take pictures around. Nice cafes around the area too. However, remember to keep quite while you're hanging around there. "
The famous paintings are gone,"It's interesting to see paintings all around the village. Expect to do a lot of a walking so it'll be pretty tiring on a sunny day. The famous paintings are now gone, they covered it with grey paint."
Most of the famous pieces are gone :(,Most of the most famous pieces are gone now. There are a few left that have been scrubbed away or scribbled over as well. However! A lot of cute cafes and little stores are littered throughout the area and are very fun to visit. The town is lovely and pretty to walk through.
every step is a piece of art,"i was very sad i cant take photos with the famous sunflower stairs since it got vandalized 2-3 days before our visit. but still got chance to take pic with the fish stairs mural (before it also got vandalized -___- few days later)i enjoy this part of seoul very much, although its a steep house area, need effort to take pretty pic. there's art in every corner of ihwa. lastly, i hope tourists will not talk loudly here as it will annoy the house owner, which later lead to the vandalizing of mural/stairs. i wish i can visit again next year"
"Art exploration, delicious ice cream","You can find interesting art along the walls as you wander along. Unforunately, the more famous paintings were gone so that was a big disappointment. When you first arrive, definitely eat at the milk ice cream place, it is SO GOOD! Climb the stairs to the top of the village, and you feel the amazing breeze and see the view of Seoul."
It's like an art gallery on the streets,Another must visit! Walk on the narrow streets and admire the works of talented artists. There are plenty of stairs but you can always take a break and take pictures with the paintings. There will be a lot of walking and it is on hill but it's definitely worth the effort.They change the paintings every now and then and some of the walls may be under construction but despite that there will be enough to see!
Pretty with artists wall painti9,"I can spend all day here. We spent about 5 hours and still didn't get to see the whole village. When we were there the famous stairs of koi painting and flower painting were renovated. I don't know if they are going to repaint it back the same way. There was a building where local vendors sell handmade trinkets and jewelries. There were 4 tables of vendors which they are not always the same vendors. I bought bracelets from a guy who made them, he spoke really good english and very friendly. Do buy fresh delicious milk ice ream from Milk Gongbang. The shopkeeper was very nice helping us call the taxi. She kept calling until one agreed to come and when the taxi got lost getting there she kept following through It was raining by that time."
Appreciate street art and the local culture in the right way,"I chanced upon a travel blog post on the Ihwa Mural village and decided to visit this place during my 7 days stay in Seoul. Visitors can find the many beautiful wall paintings and sculptures scattered around the village, all of which were create by “Art in the City” project.It was a sunny day and my Sister and I reached the village around 2pm. Unique and cosy cafes and shops dotted the streets as we walked from the Hyehwa subway station. It is around 1km walk from the station.I have read that 2 residents have removed some of the murals as protest against the tourists noise and disturbance caused to the residents. Obvious signs are seen reminding tourists to respect the resident privacy but apparently the unfortunate events happened.The small surprises along the streets as we explore the alleys was a nice experience. On a weekday afternoon, there were not many people and gives a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere. We had a short rest in one of the cafes at the top of the hill. It is advisable to plan at least half a day here to slowly explore the uniqueness of this village while paying attention to control the noise level when walking around the alleys. We need to learn to respect and protect the beautiful places if we still want to enjoy them.I will come back to visit the village again and explore through the old Seoul city wall trek from Dongdaemun."
Excellent photo opportunity,"Once you get out of hyehwa station exit 2, keep walking until you get to dunkin donuts and turn left. And then it's a bit of a climb to get there but worth it!We were lucky there weren't many people there when we went so didn't have to wait long to take photos and could take our time. We were sad when we got there that the stairs mural with the flowers wasn't there, but most of the other murals were still looking fresh. We weren't sure where the murals were so we just kept walking around exploring side streets, and then a kind ahjumma kept ushering us towards a direction which turned out to be the right direction. At the end there are a few pavillions to rest in the shade which was amazing in summer, and it's also nice to sit along the seoul city wall under a tree and look at the view. I also recommend going to naksan park which leads on from the top of the mural village, which can lead you back down to the main road."
Beautiful street art,"Advise to go in the day time to take picturesque photos. Beautiful street art here but be prepared that there is a lot of walking and uneven steps around.It is located near Naksan Park. There was flea market around the station exit when I went. From Line 4 Hyehwa station Exit 2, walk around 15 mins before you reach the entrance of Ihwa Mural Village, where you can see a long flight of brick steps. To get around Ihwa Mural Village, refer to my map indicating the different routes and attractions. They are located at different areas of the village."
Beautiful mural,"The mural here are aplenty but not easy to find and not as many those in Penang. It's also at times dangerous to take photo due to many cars. However, the cafe is very nice here and relaxing time soak in the view. "
Great for Leisure Walk,"We visited this place mid June where the weather was at its best (not hot, not cold and just nice at about 24c). So it was great for us to stroll around, enjoy the walk/view, cafes and shopping. It was kind of expected but somehow finding the murals and taking pictures with them still excited us. Some of the murals resembled those in Trick Eye. Great to have the same thing here but FREE of charge!"
Visit to Ihwa Mural Village,"Extremely hot, tons of stairs, high slopes to climb, not recommended for elderly, but worth the pictures for memories! "
Unique area but not well marked,"This area is getting popular but I was not that impressed. The view of Seoul from here and the small houses on steep hillsides impressed me more than the murals themselves. Murals are often hard to find, more signs are needed. "
No bad,"Some of the Murals are pretty good, however be prepared to walk if you would like to see all the Murals."
Fun photo spot,Ihwa Mural Village is a area close to Hyewha subway station. Some art students from the university decorated the streets and walls with beautiful and fun paintings. This is a great area for some fun photography and has a lot of small coffee shops and bakeries to full a half day. It is also close to Naksan Park and you can enjoy a stroll along one of the cities old walls.
"If you like photography, this place is not to miss!","The village is so beautiful and lives up to its name, there are many murals located across the village. Come before the sunset and you will see a beautiful view of Seoul during the sunset. The murals, the view, there are so many materials for photography."
A good place to take a picture,"It's located in Ihwa Dong, Jongno-Gu, SeoulWe should walk uphill to reach this place, about 15 minute from Hyehwa station. So it is a little bit tiring.We could find art street in this village. There are mural paintings or mosaics on the walls and on the staircases.There are a small post office, where my friend send a postcard to Indonesia from here.A good place to visit."
Nice place for photos,"Cute village where the walls and stairs are painted. Makes for great photos. Lots of cafes to eat at and handmade items for sale. It's uphill so if you're not in shape, prepare to get winded."
Lovely murals! Walking distance from the subway,"Walk from HyeHwa station (subway line 4). Amazing visuals. Interesting murals that expressed the views of the Koreans - especially if you can read Hangul.. (there was one on the island dispute with China/Japan hahahaha) Prepare to climb stairs, prepare to wait for others to finish taking photos and if you do walk all the way to the end - be amazed at the landscape of houses =)Don't worry about food - there are cafes."
Favourite place in Seoul!,"This is officially one of my favourite places in Seoul now. It's such a hidden gem! Was recommended to visit Ihwa-dong mural village by my Korean friends and I'm glad I did! Came here alone and was rewarded with a beautiful view of the city as well as the art murals. Mt. Naksan is located at the tip of Ihwa-dong Mural Village too. For those interested to visit, it's best to walk from Hyehwa station (line 4, exit 2), turn in at the alley next to Dunkin Donuts and continue walking straight up. You will eventually see a map of Ihwa-dong Mural Village."
Very nice place to visit,Though very crowded. New paintings are not as nice as the old ones. Climbing up the stairs to reach the Seoul City Wall is a kind of 2-in-1 experience. 
Nice if you are in the area,"This place isn't necessarily located in a convenient place near most hotels or other sightseeing areas so I would say it is only worth visiting if you are nearby or really interested in seeing a different, more quiet side of town. It is located near hyewha station but you do need to trek quite a ways away from the main action and into some pretty narrow paths up a hill through a quiet neighborhood to reach naksan park and the murals themselves. Depending on when you visit the murals might be in pretty good shape having just been repainted, or you might show up and find a mural that's barely visible because it's so faded and hasn't been retouched in a while. "
Street Art,"Walked around this area on a cold and rainy day. Not a easy hike up to the village but doable from subway station. The lazy way is to catch a taxi up to the top of the hill and walk down to get a glimpse of all the street arts and murals. There are many restaurants, cafes and ma/pa convenience stores if you get tired/hungry. This is a residential neighborhood so don't be loud or litter."
Little wall art,Need to walk uphill.little wall art compare to others. Not worth visiting this place unless got time.
Quaint and Pretty ,"Take Seoul Metro Line 4 to Hyehwa Station and Exit 2. Walk straight about 300m then turn left towards Lock Museum. Continue to walk straight up hill to the start of Ihwa Village. If unsure, ask the locals there. Note that there's a lot of uneven steps (without railing) around the village. There are a few cute and quirky cafes too. When walking around the village, just remember to keep the noise level low in respect of the residents there. Walk till the top, you will come across a lane and shop (it's actually a leather handmade shop) where the drama Lovely Girl was filmed. From the lane walk further up, you will get the see the whole view of Ihwa-dong town, mountains and Namsan tower on your left. On your right, it's the Seoul city wall, this village is just next to Seoul city wall. Go early in the morning to avoid crowds for picture taking. Surprisingly there ain't a lot of foreigners tourists visiting this village as compared to local Koreans. You can opt to continue to Naksan Park, which is just next to the village. Allocate 2-3 hours here at the village.  "
Ihwa Mural Village & Naksan Park,"This is quite a nice area to visit for photography & relaxation. A bit of walking uphill though.Tips to location:- Train to Hyehwa Station, take Exit 2.- 500m from subway. Walk straight and take to your left toward the structure.- walk straight again, Take to your left of toward SM Art Hall alley in front of you- Straight and take to your right.- Walk straight again and take to your left when you saw white building in front of you.- Walk straight all the way and up the sloop- Walk straight and take to your right.- Straight again but at the same time, you can find some structure on your left.- Take to your right. After 100 meters, you will find the village"
Beautiful Mural Village near Daehakro,A lot of beautiful mural arts along the way up hill. This places used to be the location of many K-Dramas.
Bring along your camera,Fun place with lots of fun art and cafes/shops to look in. Be prepared to walk up some stairs/small hill to get to the area. If you go on the weekend especially during warmer months expect a lot of crowds. If you want to go with less people it's better to go early or during the week. You can also access parts of the Seoul fortress trail from here. Fun place to visit at least once while in Seoul.
Colourful Painting But Prepared For Long Walk & Stairs Climbing,"We left our taxi too early and resulted another 15 minutes walk to the site. Prepared for long walk and stairs climbing. Agreed with other reviewers, go there early if you do not want to take good photos and not to be disturbed. You will find beautiful and colourful paintings in this lovely neighbourhood. Be cooperative to lower your voices in order not to disturb the house owners' life."
Lovely Neighbourhood,"We visited this ""village"" on a weekday (morning) as we were told that this place is a bit crowded during the weekends. The ""village"" is located on top of a hill and the road leading to this place is a bit narrow and steep at certain points. Therefore a good pair of walking shoes is recommended. There are ample opportunities to take photographs of the murals and sculptures around the ""village"", therefore it is better to go with a partner. We enjoyed the walk from the metro station to the village and it was lovely with autumn leaves on the trees and road."
Colourful Neighbourhood,A beautiful and interesting neighbourhood. It was easy to get here via public transport. The walls of the homes are decorated with murals and graffiti. Get ready to snap lots of pictures...You can access Naksan Park from here and catch the breathtaking view. I went ard in the late afternoon and managed to catch the sunset. It was simply beautiful beyond words.
Beautiful quiet time,"Went for a walk at this Cultural district to see the many mural art done by the various artists. Best to visit during weekdays and earlier part of the morning. Be prepared to walk and climb the narrow steep steps. I simply love doing it when weather was nice at 10 degrees with lovely sunshine and lesser crowd.Quaint little village which I find interesting and not too touristy yet. Those artists and home owners have done a great job to revamp the area. Great place to visit for those who have the time to spare, an estimated leisure 2 hours walk and strong legs of course."
Characterful Neighbourhood,"An interesting place to wander around when walking the Seoul city wall. We walked along the wall from Dongdaemun and came across this neighbourhood. You can wander around and see some little art studios with artisans at work as well as the murals here and there. It is a good place to stop for a coffee and admire the view down the hill. You can wander down to the adjacent park or see the old school for underprivileged students, where you can see locals renting the old uniforms and walking around in them! A great place for people watching also."
Tiring,"In order to visit this village,we had to climb up the hill.It is very tiring.I was expecting it will be easy to find the art.But it is difficult to find it.To me,the art in the hse is not that amazing.Some of the art is in their hm.Quite boring"
Overrated.,"The murals are over-rated and a lot less than expected. Plus, there were too many tourists, which meant taking photos was difficult. The Seoul City Wall and Naksan Park were much more interesting. Also, the locals tend to park in front of some of the murals. "
Awesome paintings on the wall!,"Went there on 17/11/15. We were lucky that the weather was so nice, sunny day!The location is convenient. 10 mins walk from Hyehwa-yeok station exit 2.When u walk up the hill, u will reach the entrance of Naksan Park. Turn left and walk all the way down while not entering the park, u will start seeing the paintings and some artworks on ur right side!After u reach a small cafe, go all the way down and u can see all the drawings!"
Cute place to explore and take pictures!,"Make sure to come here with a friend to take pictures for you. Lots of photo opportunities on every corner. Easy to reach by public transportation but the hill to get to the village is a bit steep. The street is rather narrow but that's the charm of this little ""village"", not too much traffic from cars. If you're into Kdrama, you may recognize of the places where dramas were filmed. Seems like a nice date spot too…lots of couples with matching shirts, shoes, etc. "
Nice stroll for beautiful mural art,"The Public Art Committee had artists to paint the walls and install artworks in this village to improve the area and since then it (including Naksan Park) is has been used as a filming location for Korean dramas (i.e. Rooftop Prince, King 2 Hearts, Angry Mom) and even one of the WGM episodes for Kwanghee and Sunhwa. The village (as well as Naksan Park) is now a growing tourist attraction as visitors flock to Ihwa for its beautiful murals and sculptures. It will not be easy to take photos anymore without someone else accidentally being in the picture. Go early, if that is what you want."
Go for the amazing views,"I went a bit late, at around 4pm as an afterthought, but it turned out to be the best decision. Sure, images turned out a little dark, but as much as I like novelty shots against murals, the views of Seoul took my breath away.The setting sun cast a romantic glow across the streets lined with trees and quaint little houses. There are many signs warning for tourists to keep quiet because there are still people living in the houses, and I saw quite a number of high school students returning home after school.Great for a glimpse into the local life, to beef up your travel album (obligatory winged shot!), to get a bird's eye view of Seoul, and for a nice, relaxing hike. The stairs can be very steep- not for elderly people or those with injuries. Wear comfortable shoes!"
A walk through laid back art,"Raring to see a laid back part of Seoul , then head to Hyewa towards Ihwa Mural Village , past Marronier Park. Murals along the walls of houses actually lived in by the locals. You get a peek into how they live and at the same time get a good view of Seoul. Having the chance to walk along a part of the Seoul Fortress wall is an added thrill."
Artistic Little Village,"It's a bit of a hike to this village, but the murals are worth it if you like art. There were a lot of local students there as well."
Artistic and Cozy Ihwa Village,Artistic place good for taking photos and nice place to walk. Also a good spot to get to see a bird's eye view of Seoul. 
Artistrek Seoul,"The village is an uphill trek with a lot of interesting murals and quirky stuffs. It is a very fun neighborhood. Silence is required in the vicinity, you might disturb the people living there. If you get hungry or thirsty, there are stores which offer food and drinks. Refer to the map so it will be easier to navigate. The trip is a bit tiring since you are going up and down but if you plan your trip, you will not be going in circles and save some of your energy.If you are a K-Drama fan, this is the place where the K-Drama Rooftop Prince was shot."
Fun walk in Seoul's hills,"A local brought me to Ihwa Mural Village, a fun neighborhood with murals and art tucked around every corner and on staircases in the hills. It was a fun way to spend an afternoon. The views of the city are stunning and there's restaurants and shops to pop into as well. Highly recommend for a place to stretch your legs, see some neat art and catch a panoramic view of the city. "
Really pretty and interesting village,"There are a few main murals to spot and the village is up on a hill so you'll be able to see the scenery around the area. Easy to get lost but there will be maps, if not, a mural of the map found to guide you along! One of the recent drama (The girl who sees smell) is also filmed there!"
Beautiful walls and staircase paintings ,Went there 5 years ago and wanted to go back again to take a photo with the exact same painting to see how much I have changed. I did not expect to be pleasantly surprised with more new paintings. It's relatively easy to navigate there as there are signs all around. Has become more touristy than the last time I went there. But it's still a beautiful place to check out. We then went for a walk at Naksan park after which has great view of the city btw. Spent about 2 hours there. Advisable to go early in the morning as it can get really hot in the afternoon. 
Perfect little getaway from Seoul,"Ihwa Mural Village is an adorable place in the middle of Seoul. Actually, it doesn't feel like you're in Seoul at all. The murals are adorable, but look out for couples with their selfie sticks! And be sure to check out Naksan Park on your way!"
Helpful Koreans ,"I wanted to go visiting this place for so long after watching the drama 'rooftop prince' as I like the wall painting. It's a bit troublesome to reach here as even the locals don't really know it. Yet, I'm very thankful to the Korean couple that I met who tried all their means to help me getting there. You can get down from hyehwa station exit 4 (if not mistaken) then go towards the direction of naksan park. It's just next to it I would say. You can spend ur evening time here before dinner. 1 hour in the village and maybe another one in naksan park. "
Worth the time to look around,"The hills and stairs are daunting, it's hot out these days and thank goodness I was wearing good sneakers. But the murals and art are worth the effort and the views of the city are the icing on that cake. The area is a little confusing, small stairs and pathways but it's something I was happy to have done."
Beautiful arts and paintings,"At ehwa mural village, there are a lot of artists painted walls & artworks. People who visits this place can enjoy looking for it. You can also post for pictures with the paintings.. a lot of students and couples visited this place and it was very crowded when i went with my friends. Must climb a bit of hill to reach but was worth it..There's a shop selling dream catchers and price varies across sizes and designs..There are also other small shops around. Overall, good to find out about the paintings and enjoy the view."
Un unexpected facet of Seoul,"I love Seoul for so many reasons. It is diverse you never know what to expect: a mountain, a temple, a tower, a nightlife district, an old palace, a mountain... That is once again the case with Ihwa Mural Village. I kind of stumbled upon it while intending to visit Naksan Park. The village features lots of small and cosy houses full of coffee houses and shops and little art exhibitions... But the main reason why this place is famous is the multitude of murals. The neighborhood is full of murals (some are actually found on steps of stairs or on the ground, rather than on actual walls). The murals themselves are - for most of them - not overly impressive artistically, but what makes the place interesting is that you'll never know what you'll encounter next. Located on the side of a hill, Ihwa is full of small streets, slanted alleyways, sloped roads, which allows for all the murals to be approached from a different perspective, with a different background, and different ways to experience the wall paintings. Walking around a street and randomly encountering a new mural in an unexpected manner is truly an enjoyable experience."
keep walking.;)),"easy to finding this place, near korea national open university. feel exciting when seeing pictures after climbing a short sloping street."
Great neighbourhood with lots of murals and lovely little coffee bars.,"A bit hard to find, but definitely worthwhile! We went to Hyehwa subway station and took exit 2. Outside, we walked straight ahead and took the first street to the left (at Dunkin Donuts). Soon we spotted the first murals, including one of a map of the area, very convenient (take a picture!)."
Beautiful happy place,"This was one of the highlights of our trip. Great location up the hill, beautiful view, cool/artsy neighbourhood. The narrow streets and the murals are just gorgeous. Right at the bottom there is the first president of Korea's house which you can visit (it was too late in the afternoon for us)."
Great to see in Seoul.,"This area was a joy to visit. Many happy children were there visiting as a excursion. The murals on the walls of homes and stairways were very clever, and a great photography opportunity. Strangely the hotel where we were staying and the taxi we hired did not know where this area was, even though it was close to the Insadong area that we were staying in."
nice mural painting,"to reach this place is quite difficult. take subway line 4 (light blue color line) to hyewa station and take exit no.2actually the place is on the hill. at the first, our group was difficult to find this place. we asked many times and most of them said just go to find the hill. and there are some signs of it. the hills is quite high and you'll feel tired to hike that, except you are a hiker or usually hike. you can see many mural paintings there and some sport are used for korean drama shooting place. you can freely going around there. take a picture is a must. actually, this is place isn't so incredible, but nice to visited. there is a park also, named naksan.around this area, there are many dining spots. because it's near a college if i'm not wrong.the ahjussi who works around naksan park told us a small dining spot near this place, sell korean food like tteokpokki, naengmyun and many other food. it's very cheap and nice.."
Enjoyable walk,"Definitely have your walking shoes on for this, as this winding roads lead you around random streets looking for all the art. Love the wall arts how interactive some of them are. A nice place to visit if you have some time for a walk."
