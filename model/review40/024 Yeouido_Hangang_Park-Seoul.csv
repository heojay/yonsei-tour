Huge park with lots of space for everyone,"This park is huge! If you're tired of the crowds in Seoul city, spend some time here. Just take a walk and enjoy the city skyline, bridges or sit and chill with friends. You can easily buy a mat at the park. We came in the daytime. Hope to catch the fireworks festival next time,!"
Perfect place to chill with friends and family,"If the weather is beautiful and you have a few hours to spare, this is the perfect place to be. It's nice to get away from the crowded Seoul streets and come out to some nice wide open spaces where people walk at a slower pace and people blast out K-pop in a friendly manner."
People Watch & Drink!,"Legit, one of the best places to stop - wish we had done it earlier in our trip. There's a guy who rents tents out to people, the little ajummas are basically waiting for you to come out of the subway so they can sell you delicious fried chicken, beer, soju, maekgoli, or tteokbokki... bring your appetite! We got some drinks, walked down toward the Han River and just picked a spot to watch people. Young, old - everyone was out in the sun and it was a great time outside the hustle of all the markets and sight-seeing."
Great park,Yeouido Hangang park is a funny and amusement place for both adolescent and the old people. It's much more great at weekends.
The place to chilling-healing,You can have a really good time here with your friend and spend quality time together. You can have a picnic with bringing your own food or just buy in the stores that provided in this place. You can also rent bike and this place is where the firework festival event for every year.
Beautiful and expansive park in the financial district,"The hangang park stretches for miles along the han river and also passes by Yeouido. The park is enormous in size actually, hard to imagine for a city short of space like Seoul. At the park is a bike trail, running trail etc and one can rent bikes. there are also cafes and restaurants, so making it the perfect destination for an afternoon outdoors. It gets very crowded on weekends however the atmosphere is great."
Really lively,"I really, really want to go back and spend a lot of time here since we just take a rush stroll through this park to Cruise Tour by E-Land. We saw lots of food and clothes stalls, people jogging and riding bike, having a picnic and basically spend leisurely time with their family and they looked so happy hahaha. To be honest, one of my travel to-do list is to ride a bike in this park, but we couldn't do that. Will definitely come back for the experience!"
Great park for kids in Summer,"Hangang Park comes alive weekends in Summer. Thousands of families with shelters and picnic blankets enjoying the free water park. Water is cold, but the kids don't seem to care. There are a couple of convenience stores within the park to provide access to cold drinks and snacks. Great spot to take kids for a couple of hours on a hot afternoon. Good views of the city and bridges over the Han River. Plenty of cycling and walking tracks."
Fantastic place for a cheeky bike ride,"My boyfriend and I hired two shopper bikes in Yeouido park. We headed off along Mokpo bridge, along the other side of the river and back across Yanghwa bridge, then back down to the park along the under-road cycle highways. It was a fantastic experience and we really enjoyed the privacy of the cycle highways along with being able to test the outdoor gyms that were dotted along the route. The park itself is lovely apart from the hawkers...the old women shoving flyers for fried chicken in our faces...however you can avoid them once on the actual bikes. The rental was cheap and the bikes worked, that is all I can ask for."
Best Place for a Walk or to Sit and Relax,"I would mainly tell people to get off at yeouinaru station, exit 1, to enjoy hangang park. It's right next to the river and has so many food trucks during the summer time. You could just grab a meal and a few beverages and sit there peacefully as long as you want. Try to go when the sun is setting so that the temperature will be cooler. This has been one of my favorite summer spots and I try to go every weekend during the summer to enjoy the area, people, and food."
Best place for a sunday evening ,"❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️The place actually made me feel Happy! Made me feel peaceful , thankful and filled with emotions. Guess it is easily confused with Yeouido Park or Hangang Park. Look for Conrad hotel and youll know this is the one.The pictures I’ve seen here do not make justice.You have families and young couples or friends relaxing over the day with their tents , you have young talented singers doing an amazing job. The sunset really changes the vibe and best to observe it is while riding a bike around the place "
River wals,"A Wednesday morning and it is absolutely empty. If in need of a quiet walk, this is the place. Bring your own entertainment."
"Pleasant, relaxing park","This is a nice riverside park along Han River for picnics or a stroll. This park is near Yeouinaru Station. When you exit the station, there is a convenience store and some stalls selling instant ramen and fried chicken. Many locals set up tents and spent the evening here. There are also bicycles for rental. We enjoyed the park as the weather was good."
Oasis in the middle of Seoul,"You actually forget that you are in the middle of a very large city. The park offers a long circuit path for walking or jogging, plenty of park benches where you can watch the world pass by. The echo area also has elevated decking paths where you can explore the flora in this area of Korea, with plenty of labels annotating the species of the various trees."
Enjoyable and relaxing time here,"Came here by Yeouinaru Station.Didn't expect it to be so crowded on the weekends. The place are filled with tents and more people are coming in continuously when we left. Really nice to have gatherings with family and friends having a picnic and enjoying the breeze. The queue for ramyeon are super long and crazy. There are also bicycle for rental which we didn't go for.The weather was really nice with the cold winds plus the sun helping to warm the place. Went on a motorised duck boat ride which it wasn't what I had imagined to be as the river was kind of not so calm that day. Only went on 2 big rounds and we surrendered.Bought a kite to fly for around 4,000 won and we really enjoyed ourselves doing so for at least an hour. Flying a kite here was really effortless without much running to get it up and flying cause the wind was really strong! Despite the sun, we stayed at this place for at least 3 hours.Good place to have a picnic here!"
great experience,"Great place to skateboard, and play with your child and family. It's a bit windy when we came, but people said that it's so good at summer. There are many bikes which are available for rent, so we got one for us to get around of the park, great experience. We also called some foods and ate in here."
Enjoy beer and chicken here just like locals!,"Yeouido Hanggang park is one of the three popular Hangang parks along with Banpo and Jamsil. This park will be extremely crowded during the Spring Flowers Festival (early April, about 10 days) and the Firework Festival (September or October, but only a few days.) Other than that, it won't be crowded that much except weekends. Many locals bring a tent or a mat (there are many rental places too) to the park, and drink (yes, you can drink in public in Korea) and eat fried chickens (they deliver it to you) here. (The regulation about the tent and trash is recently tightened) But, please noted that it will be almost empty during Winter and extremely cold to be here.Visit Friday and Saturday nights(18~23), and try international cuisines from food trucks (called Toggaebi-Yasijang) Toggaebi-yasijang won't open during Winter either."
Cherry Blossoms,We went for the cherry blossoms and enjoyed the festivities. A good deal of effort went into making the event enjoyable for people of all ages and it seems like it would be a lovely area for a stroll at any time of year.
Right time of Cheery Blossom Apr,"One of must visits in the time of cherry blossom in Seoul April... along the street of Yeouido, and the whole view of city along Hangang river... take time to picture...time to visit: 12th apr..."
A must at Cherry Blossom time - NOW,"Street artists and street food - what an atmosphere! Prime time for dating couples and picture taking. So many beautiful people at one spot, cherry blossom and forsythia in the background. "
Picnic at hangang park,"Only few tree was blooming on 3april2019Still enjoying the cold fresh air at yeouido hangang parkBy subway to yeouinaru station exit 2 or 4You can find a fully bloom treeThere was a mart beside the exit so you can buy something to eat like gimbap, ramen, instant noodle etc..Enjoy it"
The best Hangang riverside park,"This is a really nice riverside park of Hangang(Han River). Good to visit and chill.- Metro #5 Yeonaru is the closest station. It's also nice walking from Yeouido Station through Yeouido Park.- Since it's a huge area, riding a bicycle is really popular.- You can also try Eland Cruise.- It's very windy until March. Be prepared with enough clothes."
I expected more!,"Others claimed that this is the best park along Han River from my reading before we went to Seoul, but as we reached there, it is just a plain riverside with walkways..maybe we should try again in warmer months."
Bicycle! Bicycle! I want to ride my bicycle!,"This is a wonderful park. I enjoyed the art, the nature, the views and wide open spaces. My daughter re-learned to ride a bicycle here and it was a highlight of our trip."
Nice park!,"It is nice to come and just relax here with a nice book! You can also rent a bike here too, by the hours."
Late ,"We came here late, so, only had the chance to take a photo with the “I Seoul you” sign before needing to hop on the metro to meet a friend for dinner. It looks like a nice stroll along the water. "
Yeouido!,Yeouido Hangang Park has so much to offer. Every park has a unique side. Better to roam around just to see its unique beauty. :)
"Nice place for picnic with friends, family or love ones","It's a very nice place for picnic with friends, family or love ones. It's a good place to feel like ""Korean"" / local. On weekend, it will be very crowded. But all of the facilities are fully provided. You can rent the mat and tent for sitting and enjoy your picnic, rent the bicycles to ride around the area, buying food/ snacks. They also provide the clean toilets as well. You can see the nice scenery of Han river. It's better to arrive around late afternoon and spend time until the early night."
Not the place to come on a weekday in the autumn,"We popped by Yeouido Hangang Park on a weekday afternon in November, hoping to hire bikes to go for a trundle. Unfortunately the bike rental places were closed despite us checking the opening hours before. With cold and grey weather we walked for a short while exploring the trails in the park but it wasn't that pleasant beacuse of the poor conditions. We spent some time watching the river before calling time and heading back to the Metro. I imagine it could be very lovely in full sun, but our experience was dissapointing."
Beautiful trails!,"My cousin and I visited this park on a random day. We didn't have anything planned in our itinerary so we walked around and saw a bike share, so we rented bikes and rode along the trails at this park. It was so beautiful! The weather was perfect that day and the scenery was perfect for some wonderful photos. If you want to have a relaxed day along the river, I recommend this park for lounging, for picnic day or for biking."
Lovely place for a picnic!,"Very nice place to spend time with friends and family. We came on an afternoon, and people has already started their picnic.. it's even more merry in the evening as more people come. Bring your picnic mat or even rent the tents here! Pack your own food or skip the hassle by having one of the food delivery services offered. Cycling rental is available, clean and well maintained toilets. It's also interesting to just sit down and observe the people while overlooking the famous Han river. This place is definitely a venue to visit for a lovely korean-style picnic !"
"not near the central areas, but worth the trip out",definitely worth your while to make a trip here.very interesting experience to be able to call for fried chicken and get it delivered to you.Enjoyed the peace and serenity here
Loads to do,Hangang river runs beside the park which also houses 63 city - the tallest and most recognisable building in Korea. There is plenty to do here - including attractions such as Seaworld and an observatory on the 60th floor.
Nice big park,"This park is near my house-It is a very nice park to walk around- There isn't much though. Some stores and bicycle rental.But I just love the empty space. It is very nice to walk around.Sometimes, they have demonstrations here and that is not good.Other times, it can get crowded when everyone decides to come to the park.However, most of the times, it is quite empty, which I enjoy a lot.It is a nice walk to IFC and back.The only drawback is that you should not walk in the hot summer or extremely cold winter.Don't do it. I did it and I regretted it :(Overall, a very nice park :D"
excellent sakura,visited this park during the sakura season. it was amazing to see beautiful trees in the park also there is a street nearby full of cherry blossoms. there is a small lake in the center and a big open yard. recommended place to visits during sakura season.
Beautiful Park To Visit,"I came here in 2015 during the spring and there were cherry blossoms everywhere. The park itself is beautifully located along the Han River and a nice spot to spend some time enjoying yourself or with friends/family. I loved the area so much that the next time I come (spring 2019), I have planned to stay at the Conrad Seoul to have a view and be in walking distance. Highly recommend."
Riverside park,"Very, very nice place to walk. Mostly in the morning and evening. In summer there something like pools and small streams. You should have some clothes for change because you can be wet after having fun in the water. Nice place for families."
Great in Spring and fall,Is there a better place to go when it’s cherry blossom season? You can get a picnic out and drink some soju with friends. Pack a blanket though in case you get chilly.
"Leisure, better for kids","big empty space for kids to cycle and move around, hot in the day time best to go only at night. go if you want to relax without anything exciting."
Great on a nice day,This is a great park to visit on a nice day. You can rent bicycles or take a boat tour of the Han river. Many couples and families come here with a picnic lunch.
Picturesque walk along river,"Great place for a short, moderate or long riverside walk. Popular summer evening location for Seouls residents, many relaxing in pop-up tents eating meals. Can rent bicycles. Close to International Finance Centre (IFC)."
nice place,"great place for a slow walk, strolling, jogging or cycling and picnic when the weather is more breezing. perfect place at 63 building for adults and children for there's aquarium, shops & restaurants, top floor to explore."
Nice place for a stroll,If the weather is not too hot this is a great place to walk near the river. There are small booths selling food and snacks. You can rent bikes to ride or just walk around.
Visiting #63 Building..top floor.,A perfect view to watch Seoul from the top floor of this building 63...... my advise is to visit the floor early morning or late afternoon. Then from that building walk along the river...then ride a tour boat to see Seoul by the river.
Good day out,"Spent a couple of days along the River Han and one of the days At Yeouido Hangang Park. Hired a bike for a couple of hours for only $5. Easy ride heading towards the sea, but some short/steep hills back towards Seoul. Not many activities but pleasant place to spend some time."
Cherry Blossoms,It was very crowded in April but nevertheless good place to see cherry blossoms!They do have night market as well during spring but it was too cold and windy we couldn't stand it. 
Nice for a relaing weekend day,"On the weekends, this place is full of families with children of all ages. And there are a lot of bikers, so watch out for them. All in all it is a nice place to relax, take a walk or just hang out with your friends over a beer. "
enjoy your afternoon,"it's a beautiful place to enjoy your afternoon with or without someone.. you can do light sports like jogging or just walking, biking (you can rent a bike here), skateboarding, or taking pictures with the view of Han River.. the park is easy to reach.. happy travel"
Nice walking area alongside the river with small river in the park,"Nice for walk, jogging, picnic, bicycle and other sports. There are many hotels nearby. In hot summer kids can walk the small river (about 20 cm depth) with small waterfalls. "
Not much shelters but don't let that deter you from seeing good views!,"Had a picnic here with friends and people around sell picnic mats / tents so buy them if you do not have any. While we didn't see many shelters, the park is really big and we only covered a little section of it. Not many shelters but you can do the river cruise or cycle down the park to see more of it quicker. Come here if you are running out of sights to see in Seoul but want to get a great view of the Hangang River"
The famous Han River,"Finally set my feet on the famous Han River in my 2nd visit to Seoul. It was very crowded and cold when we were there. It was evening time and it was super crowded with lots of locals setting tents on the big patches of grass for picnics. There were food trucks along the way selling all kinds of goodies with none of the trucks that were without long queues. There were also performances by youngsters with audiences cheering for them along the river walk. There were also night market at the further end of the park where the crowd were even more packed. The night market stalls were selling handicraft items, from handmade soaps, pets accessories, jewelries, artwork, etc. A nice experience to be sitting on the walkway by the river admiring the night scenery with pleasant singing by the youngsters. The temperature dropped further when the night fall. So, if you want to visit the park during Spring, Autumn or Winter, remember to wear or bring along jackets to keep warm."
Must visit,"The best place for us in korea. Relaxing, enjoy our bicycle ride and the nature. 1hour KRW3000, late charges 15mins KRW1000. Enjoy your time here! "
Tandem bike anybody?,"The most popular activity to do when visiting the park is to go tandem biking. This is an activity made popular through numerous K dramas. However, it was not so easy for me and my friend- mostly because tandem biking requires synchronization between cyclists and we obviously were not in sync. However, we then requested to switch to the normal bikes and the bike rental place was extremely helpful and accommodating and allowed us to change (its KRW3000 p/h). The park is also always full on the weekend, with the locals pitching tents and laying out mats early in the evening to wait for the sunset. You can also take a cruise on the Han river for roughly KRW20,000. Overall, visiting the park is definitely worthwhile as it is free and you can enjoy a break from the busy city, take beautiful pictures and enjoy the company of your party or just relax by yourself."
Crowded but beautiful,"There's a reason this place draws crowds (especially in the Spring time). It's a wonderful place to take a stroll, walk your dog, or just lie out and enjoy the short window of time when the sun isn't too strong and it's not too cold out."
Yeouido Hangang Park,Nice park with enjoyable activities. Easy to access by public transport. Better to visit on a warm day.
Interesting experience ,"This is a place where the local youths hangout to eat, drink and chill out in general. We decided to come here to try the local fad - eating ramen noodles in the park.First you have to go to the very crowded convenience store to get your ramen. Next, cook your noodles. The store provides every amenity that you will need for a hot bowl of noodles. Lastly, find a spot amongst the very crowded waterfront to eat!This was a good experience to enjoy your food, people watch and seeing the world go by. However the crowds and noise will seriously turn you off.Granted, this is a public location and we came on a Saturday but it was a bit turn off.We also discovered to our amusement that there is a booth in the park. You can actually call to order food delivered to you and the delivery man will meet you at the booth.It was an interesting one time experience, however we will not probably come back here again. "
Went there for Cherry Blossom,"We went there for Cherry Blossom. It was pretty but there are other places in Seoul with better Cherry Blossom display. First of all, the place was way too busy even during a weekday. I recommend going to the Lotte World park to view the cherry bloosm"
Not up to date,"There are several places, which are higher, that is why the attracting point is broken. Back in the days that was nice to visit this building, but now, when there is Lotter Tower in the city, sorry... Though the area around building is nice:)"
Very scenic park for great photos!,The park was filled with young people pitching tents out on a picnic. Love the youthful energy there! Many scenic spots for great photos especially the sign I SEOUL YOU. There were tents and mats for rental. And roadside food stalls.
Sunday morning walk,"A lovely walk through to the river on a very, very cold wInter morning but really pleasant n the midst of a vast mega city."
A lovely place for a spring walk!,Had a lovely time walking along the Han river in the sunshine. There are boat trips that leave from the area and you can also cycle along the paths (you can hire bikes too). We finished off our walk at the food court in the base of the Seoul 63 building since there aren't any places to eat on our stretch of the walk. It was quiet enough for our walk but I believe the park gets much busier in the late spring and autumn. We also went there for the International Fireworks festival and it was CRAZY busy! I imagine it will be the same in cherry blossom season...
Amazing and Cheap Vacation around Seoul ^^,It is good recommendation to take vacation at here during spring period.you can relaxing by see a lot of kind of beautiful flower. you can also use some of facility and game a round this park with free or very cheap to pay.
Make Ramen Noodles at the convenience store!!!!,"whether you like to walk, bike, skate, or run you can do all there here at the Hangang park. Amazing place to come with family or with friends. you can ride pedal boats or even have lunch or dinner in a boat. if you want to make things more romantic you can go on a dinner cruise on the Hangang. or if you just want to breathe in the fresh air and walk around you should make sure to visit the convenience store and get your self some ramen!!!"
Beutiful in summer cold in winter,"I have been able to be in summer and, winter and this park is beautiful in bouth seasons. Can get really windy in winter and is really busy during the weekends in the summer time. You have de view of the 63 building. And some hotels. People like to go during the summer and bring their tent and be there during the day with they family or friends. Is a lot of events during the summer time so check out what is going on during the weekends is a,lot less busy in the autumn/ winter. You can rent bicycles and go around the park. Or go for a run, in weekends is a lot of people walking, hogging, running is really beutiful."
Scenic walk with a break at a convenience store,"Overall the location is easily accesible via subway (yeouinaru station - line 5), directly above the station.There is a convenience store right at the entrance for those wanting to try having a DIY ramyun meal while enjoying the hangang park view.Nothing much but a good place to just sit and relax or if you have a bike, the place is designed with bicycle lanes for bikers."
Cherry Blossom in Spring is a real beauty!,"Yeoido Han River Park is very beautiful, especially Spring time with a lot variety of flowers, including Cherry blossom."
Relaxing in any season,"Visited with 50+ school kids in the start of winter!! Clear, cold and stunning! A great place to hang out, ride bikes, walk the riverbank, play in the gardens among statues, gardens, paths and big lawned areas. Sculptures, fountains, stunning views of the city and bridges. Boats on the river were preparing for night cruises with christmas decorations and lights but the cafes happily served food and drinks to us all. Due ti the cold, there were not big crowds so we had the place pretty much to ourselves, however it can be crowded. Beautiful views up and down the river and across to the city, Definate stop in Seoul."
Great place to relax,"I visit here often. It's quite, spacious, with some great views of the 63 building. Just take a blanket and some food and have a great picnic. It's beautiful when the cherry blossoms bloom. It can become very crowded at that time."
Bike rides ,Great long straight location for a bike ride near the river. Lots of side for walking or running too. Gives good views of the bridges. Can connect to Seoul Forest 
Great place to spend the day outdoors with family!,This is one of Seoul's best picnic spots. What is most enjoyable is the little man-made stream thay runs along the park and the open swimming pool. Its a great retreat for children and adults as well and I always feel Han river looks its best from this spot. 
Good place for picnics and cycling ,"Stop at Yeouinaru and take exit 2.Many couples were around for pinics (they have many pushcart stalls that sell picnic mats for 2,000-5,000 Won each).I went in sept and during the day it was a nice cool breezy 22 degrees.Many people were jogging or cycling along the river and the designated tracks.A must visit if you don't want to spend money but want a beautiful day out."
A beautiful green park in the middle of a busy city,This is a nice large park in the middle of the busy city. There are various parts of different sections with different themes. You can rent a bike to ride around. A good place to spend some time away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Very busy during the weekends with the locals coming with their family.
Nature treatment,"Its very large area for sightseeing, you should spend time more than 3 hrs with my map. Firstly, taking subway transportation to Yeouido station, heading to NorthWest and walk through Yeouido Park and taking photo with National Assembly. Turning back to Yeouido Hangang Park. After this route, I found the minimart(named Mini Stop) where the chicken shop is on 2nd floor. So nice and memorable nature treat in Seoul!"
Picnic by the river,"If you have some extra time, come here for an evening picnic by the riverside! Order from the delivery (if you know how to order in Korean or have a Korean friend with you) but if you don't, fear not! Plenty of stalls along the way where you can pick up your food and drinks and picnic mats to rent for you to enjoy the view of Hangang."
Buzzing riverside park,"The park is filled with street food trucks and people pitching up their tents enjoying the great outdoors. There are various water features further down and a few stages for street performances from budding student artists or even professionally debuted groups if you're lucky. The paths are also great for cycling, and you can rent bikes or tandems on site."
really nice in the heights,"Really nice tower in front of the beautiful river. You should take the tour upstairs and in hot wather, also you can have an ice cream down."
Loveeeee it ,"Singers, people and families all in one beautiful melting pot. View is awesome and I love just walking there while taking pictures and listening to the buskers"
Han River cruise at sunset,"Having my korean family in Seoul, i can only recommend a Han river cruise at sunset to see Seoul skyline and the bridge with the fountains ! "
Good place for picning,Seoul is blessed with beautiful landscape and you can see it from here. The best time to visit is in Spring. Enjoy picnic in the park with rented mat or you can also buy one for a very affordable price.
A nice walk along the Han River (Hangang),"We stayed a week in Seoul and that day we felt like getting a bit away from all the action downtown. A quick subway ride brought us to this pleasant park right at the Han River. There are lots of locals, mostly school kids and students (at least on a weekday) roaming the area and not many tourists....which isn't a bad thing.This park has quite a nice setting with some good city views and lots of space to walk, bike or relax. A bit SEOUL sign at the river is the perfect photo op.There is a good number of small restaurants, mostly chicken & beer and a huge bike rental, if you feel like driving instead of walking, quite cheap even.If you are here in spring you might get lucky to see the cherry blossoms....we just missed by only a few days. Well, a good reason to go back I guess. After this park you should also check out the nearby Yeouido Park with some nice strolls (and more cherry blossoms in season).All in all a nice place to spend some time away from all the action.Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
Spacey and fresh,"I visited this place at morning and the weather was really nice and refreshing. The place is also spacey, have a good air and view. You can walk along in the side of han river or you can rent a bike and enjoy going around the han river. It's a nice place to visit."
Stunning,A really beautiful park with cherry blossoms. My friends and I once rented bikes here too which was great fun. A lot of locals also venture out to the park to spend the day here which was really nice to get amongst. A lovely park to stroll through.
Cherry Blossom Park,"It's a good place during April in Seoul because you can see whole park with cherries!Also a good place for dating and resting.You will not find very hot during April, and with all the trees covered."
A nice place to visit in the spring,I have been here once only - a nice place to visit in the early April. The park and the street is lined up with hundreds or thousands of cherry blossom trees. It is beautiful to stroll along the scented street or rest in the park. The upside of it is that it is really popular with the locals; so be prepared to be in the midst of thousands of people (during the Cherry blossom festival). I imagine the Park and the street with trees looking beautiful in the fall as well.
Very futuristic,Whilst I did not go up the 122 storey building I found the architecture very stunning. The space around made a gun place to visit. 
Average Part of Seoul,"I don't really recommend this part of Seoul. There is nothing interesting around this area, only a park where people can do exercise. Maybe during cherry blossom season, it would be more interesting. We visited this park as part of our walking tour and cruise at Han river"
Cherry Blossom Park in Spring,"I purposely choose this park to visit in April since it held the biggest cherry blossom festival in Seoul during spring. To reach there, take Subway Line 9, and alight at National Assembly Station, Exit 1 (the nearest to walk to the park). The cherry blossom trees are everywhere, along the road near the National Assembly building. It was very crowded with visitor during this time of the month, since the scenery here was really amazing & lovely and makes every photos turn out good! Unlike in Japan, they don't have snack stall or place to picnic (hanami) here, so the atmosphere is different from Japan, it more Korean styles of enjoying the cherry blossom. However, it was still very memorable Cherry Blossom experience in South Korea."
Lovely park!,The park is quite big and is lovely to take a morning stroll in. Also caught some cherry blossoms there so it was really pretty. Great for picnics too as the grass is nicely trimmed.
Beautiful Spring View,Fortunately we came in April to witness the beauty of Cherry blossoms everywhere. This large park also gives a friendly vibe for friends and family day out. Worth to stop by while in the Seoul. 
Massive park with Cherry Blossom,The park is very big and crowded during April. There are many cherry blossom and great view for taking photos. Took us some time to get out of the train station. Do come early and find a nice place for picnic. 
Must go for cherry blossom watching ,"Got a snack and sat down by the park area with the local ajusis and ajumas. Walked for two hours and flowers everywhere. Most cherry blossom to see, among all locations I went to in Seoul. "
A park to see the Cherry Blossoms.,We just missed the Cherry Blossom Festival by a couple of days. Nevertheless they were in Full Bloom and along the street were lots of the trees lines with Cherry Blossoms. There is also a cruise one can take if it suits your fancy. Easy enough to get to via Train or bus.
Beautiful Cherry Blossoms,"This park is worth a visit during Cherry Blossom season, especially during its spring festival. To reach this place, take the subway to National Assembly station, and exit from Exit 2. You need to take a 7-10 minute walk to get to the park. The place is crowded and filled with locals and tourists alike, but its draw is the rows of cherry blossom trees with the hangang river as the backdrop. Lovely place for photo taking and capturing the beautiful cherry blossom flowers. We had a nice and slow stroll along the park for a good 2-2.5 hours, during the Spring festival."
Cherry Blossoms!!!,"Reached the park early in the morning ( to avoid the crowd)by taking a direct bus from Myeongdong. It was a beautiful sunny morning & the river breeze was so refreshing. Although the date of blossoming was last week, it is lucky to see most of the flowers were still intact ! Leisure walk along the river bank was relaxing & pleasant ,it's definitely an ideal place or picnic! Bicycle rental is available there as well! Recommended if you are visiting Seoul in spring ,just to have a leisure stroll ,have a break from the hustle & bustle of the city ! "
A must visit for beautiful cherry blossom!,Though it was very crowded we loved every bit of this beautiful park. We visited this place once in evening and once during a sunny afternoon. Lots of food vendors selling amazing snacks and accessories. Different light installations at night around the ferry ticket area make for great photo opportunities.This was our best experience in Seoul :)
Great but very crowded ,"Take the metro and walk a couple a minutes and you'll be there. It's lovely to see the river and all the cherry blossoms, but make sure to visit when it isn't overly crowded with people. If wanting to see it at it fullest then having sunshine and clear vision is a must."
Pleasant way to spend a sunny afternoon.,"Overlooked by the spectacular gold 63 City building, Yeouido Hangang Park is a pleasant place to spend a few hours. The park meanders beside the Hangang River and crossed by a number of bridges from northern Seoul, is easily reached by taxi, bus or subway. The park has playgrounds scattered along the shore making entertaining children a little easier. Bike rentals near the restaurants and wharf area allow the option of a bike ride along both sides of the river. For those less interested in bike riding, cruises leave the wharf and ply north and south of their starting point. Cruise times vary. Highlight of one of the cruises is the Banpo Bridge fountain which is best viewed in the evening when coloured lights illuminate the spectacle..."
Good place to chill and relax,Went here just last week and I can say that this is a good place to chill and relax. Nearby food establishments where you can purchase food for picnic or you may bring your own. Bicycle lanes available in case you decide to ride your bike. Not sure if there is a place where you can rent one though since I didn't see any when I went there.
A must visit place!,I really love the 64 building because it was so beautiful in the picture. It was a good place for picnic beside the Han river.
Huge Green space in Seoul,"Leisure time in Seoul, Recommend place to Picnic with quite green place. Bicycle rental service is available."
Not for winter,"A vast open space with hardly anyone there. Well it was a chilly day in winter, looking at the reviews summer is when it all happens."
Best decision I've made,"Went here twice, once in Summer and once in Winter. Enjoyed the trip in Summer way more so we got to cycle, picnic and play with water the whole afternoon! The cycling track is amazing especially during sun set. The view was spectacular and will definitely revisit this place every time I go to Seoul. Extremely relaxing!"
Just nice,Just park that you can picnic and have an activities like cycling or jogging especially during summer. But during winter nothing much you can do here.
for summer,"just park as you can see. there are some nice cafe. Summer is nice, there is public pool. but winter, there is no entertainment. "
Lovely park,"Especially in summer this is a really good place to visit. The atmosphere is pretty nice, it is not as rushed as other parts of Seoul and you have a beautiful view on the Han river and it surroundings. As a result of the food trucks you can also still be there for dinner, though, since it can be busy it can take a while to get food. Overal a must when visiting Seoul"
"Escape from the city, right within the city","Conveniently reached via Yeouinaru metro station (purple line) this park on the northern side of Yeouido island, fronting the Han river, provides a quiet escape from the concrete and human density of Seoul. I was there on a bright autumn weekday and it was virtually deserted. Some parts were clearly designed for events (thankfully none in progress), but follow the paths and you will be led to areas with wild grass and solitude.There are great views across the river to the northern half of Seoul. Would also be a wonderful place to jog is you're so inclined. "
Lovely park. Ice festival in winter,"Lovely park. Although most trees were bare in winter, you can still see some with red autumn leaves. There is a beautiful pond which is partially frozen. The park is clean and great for walking. Toilets are clean too. In fact there are two parks joined by a tunnel. One is nearer to the Han river, while the other part is nearer to the commercial area. In the one nearer to the Commercial area (get down at National Assembly station), there is an ice park. You can do ice skating (payable) or sledding (payable) or just play with the artificial snow(at the moment) for free. Small food stalls are set up. "
Yeouido Hangang Water Park,"I went there at evening, and there are many people having night picnic there. It was surprisingly crowded there. It a very good place to chill out with friends."
Comfortibg park in the middle of Seoul CBD,"Surrounded by busy environment, Yeouido Park is a choice to visit (for doing sport, friends gathering or chilling around).The atmosphere is perfect to refill more energy before going back to hectic life"
Good place,"Its fun with kids and family or friends. Bring lots of food to eat, mat , book and enjoy with fresh air and surroundings."
a place to relax,"I went here during Spring time and it's nice to see some Spring flowers in the area. You can just sit here to relax, have a picnic or do a bike stroll. It also has a good view of the Hangang river and the long bridge. This place is accessible from the train station."
Fabulous night view of Seoul from 63 Square,"As soon as you get off from the Yeouinaru metro station and walk towards the Yeouido Hangang Park by the Han River, you will see Seoul's tallest building - 63 Plaza. Takes about 15 min walk. Among the attraction is 63 Art Museum and Observatory. You will have a fabulous night view of Seoul and the Han River. "
"So beautiful here, very close to river","I loved roaming this park on foot and via bike. The sights—filled with natural beauties—are so pleasing to the eyes and calming to the soul. I capped off my first time in Seoul here, and the bike ride along Han River made me cry just cause I was so thrilled to be there hahahaha :D"
Love this place!,"It is really amazing in the night time. The nice lighting, great views of the other bank of the Han-river, lot of people walking around. The taste of real modern korean life. You can take drinks and food and sit on the stairs listening to the street concerts, or walk arong the river, or take bicycle. "
A park like a park like a park everywhere….,"Nice for a picnic, or for your lunch break if you work in one of the skyscrapers nearby. Otherwise, there are some meadows, some trees, a river, a cafe, a small pagoda and so on- but nothing which is special to Korean culture. Nearby the river there are a few nice other spots, one can take a walk there. Even so it is not the ""cultural hotspot"", the area around the river and the park may be nice to play with your children, have a picnic and/or enjoy the relative calm there."
Lovely place to relax,We took bikes and cycled along the Han River until we went to find some fried chicken and stopped to sit and have a picnic. It was lovely to ride in the late afternoon and experience the sunset view alongside the river. It was the best thing to do to finish off our trip in Seoul
"Great Place for a Picnic, Relax and Take Pictures","The Yeouido Hangang Park offers great views and is a good place for a picnic, jogging or cycling. You can also take great pictures and enjoy the river breeze. It is also very accessible via metro (alight at Yeouinaru station, Seoul Subway Line 5)"
A great place for picnic,"Took the subway and exited at Yeouinaru Station Exit 2. Upon exiting, there were stalls selling food and renting of picnic mats. There were also a lot of Ahjummas giving out flyers of food delivery service. Great for picnics, cycling, roller blade and etc. A lot of young teens and adults having picnic with friends. Views were great as it is facing the Han River. A calm and relaxing place. A downside was there was a huge amount of rubbish inappropriately disposed at the side of the stairs. "
Nice promenade along Hangang River,"Built along the Hangang River on Yeoui Island, the park is a popular location for families and friends for a weekend outing. There are hawkers selling snacks and mattress for picnicking if you do not bring one. You can even order fried chicken to be delivered to the park for you. Get the advertising pamphlet from one of the many distributing near subway exit. Here you can also board one of the ferries for a 40-minute tour along the Hangang River. The park is very accessible, simply take subway line #5 and get off at Yeouinaru station exit 2."
Nice stroll while waiting for hotel check in,"We had a nice quiet stroll in the morning to early afternoon here since our hotel check in is not until later on. Take a nice walk, enjoy the view, I recommended to visit this attraction only if you are staying in this area, otherwise it's not something you would travel far for."
A good place to relax with family,A good place to relax. Your kids would enjoy it. The place is open with lots of activities that can be done. Neat and clean. Plus you can go on a ferry ride.
Great atmosphere,"One of my favorite places I've visited during our stay in Seoul. A lot of Koreans relax here, mostly families and young couples. Although it can get really crowded, it's still a nice and chill atmosphere, especially during sunset."
Walk by the river,I recommend this walk in the park after going to the 63 Building. Beautiful views to the beach. There are a couple restaurants over there ideal for a date.
"great view, relax","Though i didn'T intend going to this park, but the promenade fascinated me and i needed to have a look. If i would have more time i would have walked around the river or just sit down there and enjoy the great view over the city."
Special experience of korean culture at Hanriver Park,"It was just coincident for me to visit there with my wife! But I experienced real korean culture! You know what? You can get delivery service there and can have it at the park on the bench or somewhere you can seat on! Plus Beer or Soju-Korean drinksAtmosphere was relaxing but exciting,too~ you can see many locals having fried chicken and beer or someone had black noodle.... I joined that one since our tour guide helped me to order fried chicken~It was good experience doing the same thing like localI recommend to do that at Hanriver park I mean ordering something!"
Summer Gateaway,"After our early dinner together with my two Korean friend, they brought us to Hangang Park. And we saw a lot of people i.e. from dating to friends to families that gathered in this place they esp. during summer. Our host even told us that families build tents and slept over the night, it's how safe the place is. It's a huge park right beside the longest Han River. There's a lot of things you can do like jogging, biking or just to simply chatting with your friends. You can go there by taking off from Yeouinaru subway station. :)"
Fun place during the summer festival,"Visited the park during a business trip. So it happened the park was next to the hotel I was staying. Went for a walk on a Friday afternoon and all the food trucks were out. Decided to try a few things and I do not regret it. Even without the food trucks, I would still recommend this park for those that love to walk and love nature. "
The sanctuary," Whenever I feel tired about urban life, I always go to Han river park. Just wandering around the park, watching the massive pillars which support bridges. I use this place as my sanctuary."
Great outdoor activity along the river for all,"About: The park is situated in the heart of Korean politics, media, finance and banking. Here you learn more about nature and ecology. Things to do here:Attractions include water light square, waterside fountains, bicycling along the river, public swimming pool, camping, water park, fishing (along further down the bicycle path), take a ferry trip and many more things to do. You can visit the Seoul Yacht Marina. Tips: You can hire a bicycle from here too if you did not hire one from Yeouido Park, if you want to enjoy more with a great ride alon the river and save time too. Best time to come is no later than 6 pm so you can see the island while sunlight and view the beautiful sunset over the river too. Sunset is approx 8pm. If you going with children take their bathing suits and a towel so they can enjoy the public pool. "
Great place to catch the Cherry Blossom Festival,We went there on a Saturday during the Cherry blossom festival - was quite crowded but worth a visit during the beautiful cherry blossom days
nice park to hang out on a sunny day,"It's a large park close to the river. it's nice, it's suitable to hangout when it's sunny and you want to have a nice sunset moment and enjoy the free artists who play music"
Nice park with great view,"This is anothet park closed to the hotel I am staying. It's reall nice with great view over the river and city. Lot of people go there for picnic and cycling. There are washroom, playground, cruise. Should visit it if you are in the area."
Beautiful at night,"First of all, if you ask ""hangang park"" to Korean, they'll ask you back, ""which hangang park?"" Because hangang is a very long river and there are tons of parks all the way.Yeuido Hangang Park is one of the hangang parks you should visit. There's a cruise service that gives different themes at night, regular service at noon. The lights along the park are beautiful!So many people had picnics or cycling along the park."
Lovely park,"We went in the morning by subway. As it was not too hot, we rented bicycles and cycled for an hour along the Hangang river. It was very fun. There were amenities like playgrounds and toilets along the park. It would be nice to pack some food and have a picnic there."
loved a nice sunset here!,this place is super nice for spending some time outdoor with friends. you can go biking for 3000w/hour and enjoy some food sitting in the grass. 
Beautiful Park With A View,"A very nice park with lots of little activities to do! I was so happy when I came across this park, it was a nice break from the city. It's quite large and spans the length of the Yeouido island. There was a shallow pool which looked like a lot of fun (so remember to bring swimming clothes!). Bikes, tandem bikes, and Segues are available to rent. You could easily spend half a day or a whole day here. Views were amazing. Great for people watching, photography, and any outdoor activity."
Great place to chill,It is a park alongside the Hang River and it is a great place to chill. Many Koreans went there to picnic and tourist and rent a bike and enjoy the bike ride in the park. You can go for a boat trip too but I think its not special and its not a wow factor for me. The park is very big so you can spent half day in there to chill and relax.
rent a bike and take a round river ferry trip,"things to do here :1- rent a bike and enjoy bike ride.2- buy river ferry ticket (the round trip last for an hour and circle back again to the place of departure)3- bring your picnic stuff and enjoy the grass and the good view (many Koreans bring small tents with them) also you can order chicken or pizza and it will be delivered to you near the metro station or on the street (some Korean language is needed)4- visit 63 building (the golden building) there are an aquarium , wax Museum and an observatory"
Love love,"Me and my boyfriend really enjoyed hanging in hangang park. The first day we went for a boat trip, it was nice but not a wow factor. Later we walked around the nightmarket and there is loads of food trucks with delicous food.The next day we rented bicycles, we rented two bicycles for two hours for 10 000 won, which I think is really cheap. A thumbs up is that you can hang out drinking alcohol and eating in this park.I wished we had a park like this at home.."
Great break,"Great place to just chill be the river. We went to just have a snack and soju by the river but ended up renting bikes, a tandem and single coat for an hr was 9,000 won. About $8 US. Bikes were in good shape unlike some I've rented in different places. Super chill to ride along the river on wide sidewalks. There are bathrooms here and there and small convenience stores for whatever ya need. Some bring tents and hang out for hours and others just pass through. It's clean safe outdoors and would definitely recommend if you're looking to get outside and kill some time in Seoul! "
A Glimpse of Korean Weekend,"Took the metro and got off here for my river cruise. It is very interesting to see how Koreans esp young ones spend their Saturday night. They're having picnic with their friends and families. Lots of children playing around, drinking, laughter on the background,performances by a live band, food stalls everywhere...it's just fun to see. One can go strolling in the big park or ride a bike. It's good for the family and even for a solo traveler like me."
Never ending Cherry Blossoms,"During the Cherry Blossoms period, we took a public bus to the beginning of the Park where all the street food were. As we continued walking, we saw bigger Cherry Blossom trees, they were having a festival there too. The view was endless and amazing! Totally worth the walk!"
A nice place for a walk if you are staying nearby,"We had only a few hours in Seoul before we had to catch a flight to Hong Kong. Our hotel recommended we take a walk around the park. It was nice to get out and get some fresh air before getting back on an airplane, we were flying for 2 days. The cafe at the park entrance was opening and we wish we had time to sit down and enjoy a coffee and the view."
"Nice park in the city, great for bike rides","I spent 1-2 hours for just a little bit of nature to enjoy on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I bought some food from the convenience store inside it and picked a spot to eat it in peace. there were families with kids riding bikes and even those ubiquitous ""couple-bikes""."
very crowded on weekends.,"went there, hoping to see some cherry blossoms, but there werent any when we went there as the season had just ended. still pretty awesome to see how the Koreans actually spend their weekends there, camping and hanging out with their loved ones. we saw some filming going on too. there's food and street performers too. "
Beautiful park,"This park is huge and beautiful. I have been here on different occasions during different seasons with different people. One thing for sure, we have always enjoyed our trip there. I always have my annual winter vsit to this park just to give myself a short break fro the crazy schedule. It is always quite empty during winter so it feels like I have the park to myself. Watching the sunset while having a cup of coffee in a cafe which faces the river is perfect. During fall and spring, picnic is something not uncommon especially among locals. Go for a bike ride or just sit down and enjoy your time with family and friends. Either way it will be a fun day for you. I always avoid going to the cherry blossom festivals because it will be too packed with people. Instead I would suggest going several days earlier or well a day or two earlier would be fine too as most trees will be blooming by then and it won't be as pack as during the festival period. Sometimes, there are also performances at the main park area. So just sit back, relax and enjoy the scenery and time with your loved ones."
Beautiful huge park,"Went there during the full bloom of cherry blossom. It was very crowded as people flocked to see the full bloom. However, the view was magnificent! "
Cherry blossom festival,"We visited during the the Cherry blossom festival or the flower festival as they call it. This was from April 4th 2016 to April 10th. Breathtaking view of the Han River plus endless rows of cherry blossom tress in full bloom, what a sight to behold. Priceless for those who love to see the tress at their best bloom."
"Great view, street vendors and cherry blossoms!",Went there during the Spring Flower Festivals and loads of families and couples were seen there along with great food from street vendors and also flower booths. Good view of the Hangang and would be nice for cycling and picnics. Loads of seagulls though so beware!
Your Relax Time in Seoul,"if you wanna escape from your hurry life, you must visit this park, where you could enjoy the scenery from the Hangang River, and rent a bike to ride along the river where you will have a great moment, and impressive scenery in your mind!"
April Blossom,The blossom festival tracks round the outskirts of the park and around the river. The cherry tree lined streets are beautiful (but busy) currently the main roads are closed to car traffic and there are stalls and stages for performances. 
Very romantic park for couples!,"My fiancé and i rented a bicycle from Yeouido Park and we cycled all the way to Hangang Park from Yeouido park. One of the best decision made as we were able to enjoy the best of both parks. Rental of tandeum bicycle cost us about 6,000KRW for 1 hour, which we thought was quite reasonable. It's a huge and beautiful park. "
My favourite place!,"This park is a long stretch and you can do a lot of activities. It is very lively and colourful during spring time though but not during winter. Although, one can get to enjoy the cold breeze as needed. They have bike rentals, food shops, there's street food as well. They have benches if you just want to sit back and relax. Recommended time to visit is Spring. "
Really amazing if you want to go out of city rush,peaceful experience. You get to feel the Fresh air with the smell of a river (literally it smells like raining). a good place to think about yourself. Make sure to checkout fireworks festival in fall/autumn season
Relaxing park,"Visited this park with my boyfriend. We took a walk around the park and took some photos. We noticed a lot of couples and families walking around the park. It is very relaxing park with nice scenery. We enjoyed the scenery (but the weather is really cold). There are some cafes and convenient stores nearby where you can have a quick bite and some hot drinks. This park is located near Yeouinaru station (여의나루역), exit 2. Walk out of the station and the park is at the right hand side."
Rexing,I like this park its very relaxing....It's perfect for couples a lot of Korean couples come here to walk especially in the spring and fall.
great spot for leisure,"Favourite spot for locals during weekend. Couples, families, friends love the spot. Great view across the Hangang River"
Its a space,Its just a big open space off the side of the road but at least it is quiet and the grass is nice and on a summer day great place to draw or read with an umbrella 
Relaxing place!,I love going there whenever I visit Seoul. The best relaxing place in Seoul and you can ride bicycle there. 
My fav place in Seoul,"I don`t think I can ever be tired of this place. No matter the season, no matter the weather, I just love walking there, or just have a coffee. I once missed my last train, just because I was enjoying the night view... "
Tucked Away Gem,"I was really blown away with Yeouido Park. It is in the heat of the financial district in Seoul, but don't let that dissuade you, it's wonderful."
Wonderful Park with Hangang view,"I wanted to see the Hangang River, and Yeouido offers spectacular view of the river. Even though the traffic is busy, we can watch the traffic pass by without hearing it. Nice place to relax and stroll."
Lovely summers day out,"Water fountains and man made streams to play in, views of the river. Bicycles to rent and grass to sit. What more do you need on a sunny afternoon."
try to rent a bicycle to go around this park,"South Korea very understanding what people want. There's so many park, beautiful park. Better if you ride a bicycle here.. Actually if you want to go to this place, please be relax, don't just sight seeing. ENJOY it.."
Beautiful area,"I was lucky enough to visit Yeouido to meet a friend who works for Hyundai and it was such a beautiful area. It was also a little bit of a shock for me as I visited Yeouido which is mostly business people, politicians and police before going to Itaewon which is the foreign district. I didn't see any other foreigner whilst I was in Yeouido and I think several people were surprised to see me there.Yeouido itself has many tall buildings with lots of glass fronting. The style of the buildings is very western and far away from traditional korean architecture. There's also the parliament building there with many protests happening on a daily basis. I saw at least 4 police coaches whilst I was there and as I passed they were deploying towards the protests. The park is absolutely beautiful and much needed there. It was thriving with people taking part in some sort of game show, as well as office workers and elderly people getting excercise.There's a large soft track that spands the outskirt of the park and several toilet facilities. In the centre of the park there's an astro-turf/basketball area with plane statue. There's also a nature reserve with a small stream and wooden paths you can walk along so you don't distrurb the animals. I only saw many plants and some birds but it was so quiet and serene. I was surprised that they'd made wheelchair access to the paths with areas along the path to move a wheelchair into should the user need a rest. "
A nice enough park... but you didn't travel all the way to Korea for a park did you?,"If you've come all this way to Korea you'll want to find yourself something else to do because, as lovely as Yeouido Hangang Park may be, it doesn't deviate far from other average parks around the world. If you're a local looking for a relaxing time then by all means this park is more than decent. However, the disappointment of the city skyline - or a lack thereof - and you've got yourself a park that doesn't prove to be a good visit for tourists."
Lovely Park for Relaxation,We took a stroll through the park and it was very relaxing. There was plenty of space with people enjoying different activities from cycling to exercising. I wish we had parks like these in the United States
Very relaxing and suitable to have a picnic there,"regardless it's day time or night time, Koreans love to chill by the Hangang! It was comfortable and plenty of space to sit and relax, talk or even picnic. It's beautiful but you can try to search if there are any activities in the area otherwise it can be a little boring."
Easy stroll by the Hangang banks,"Looking for a riverside stroll / The Yeuido hanggang park is a good option, as the =Hanggang river banks is filled with parks to stroll on , bike around , lounge around , picnic in. I like this particular park specially in spring during Cherry blossoms ! Just perfect ! "
Nice setting to have a picnic or ride a bike.,You can easily spend a few hours walking along the Han river or hire a bike for a few hours and do a loop of the track :)
Enjoyable place especially before 6 p.m.,"This park is so famous with beautiful view. I like to walk or take a bicycle in this park especially before 6 p.m. because sometimes it is crowded after 6 p.m. But mostly this place is so quiet and enjoyable before 6 p.m. Several years ago, Seoul city reconstructed this park and after that, this place is so clean and nice to walk(You can rent bicycles at some places). It has many convenience stores, cafes and restaurants(mostly fried chicken and beer) but this place is huge so in not famous part, maybe you have to walk to find those. Seoul citizens like this place and I recommend this place for visitors, too."
Must visit during Cherry Blossom season,"I just so happen to be in the area during the cherry blossom season and it was beautiful. I also went back a little after the fact throughout my time in Seoul. Its a great place to ride your bike or go for a jog. If you are dating someone, you need to take them during the cherry blossom season. You just might get lucky, lol."
Great for walking or biking around. ,"This park is located on the south side of the Hangang river. It is a well maintained park with some kiosks for buying drinks or snacks. You can also opt for renting a bike at the park. Bikes are relatively small, but they work well in general. There's a biking trail in the park. But you can also leave the park and bike along the river Hangang. If you like biking and are a confident biker, this is what you should do in my opinion!There you'll find a nice walking and biking trail along the river. It's a great way to do some exercise and enjoy the views along the river. There are several resting areas and kiosks around. It can get very busy in the weekend. Enjoy!"
Great Park,"Extremely crowded place, but still you can enjoy. Hiking, riding a bike, and picnic are available, and you can drink some alcohol too."
Create another Seoul memory by cycling along Hangang river bank,The open park along the river would bring join to anyone in your family. Me & my daughter spent whole morning here as we rent 2 bikes (with helmets) & cycled along the river. The rental fee was very reasonable & you can see most of Yeouido landscape from the river bank. 
Expansive views of the Han River but not much else,"Hangang Park was constructed on reclaimed land on the shores of the Han River and is easily accessed on Metro line 5 from Yeouinaru station. Compared to the leafier and more scenic Yeouido Park nearby, Hangang Park is rather sparse with open grassy sections and long walking paths. Trees, where present, are fairly few and far apart. However, this layout gives the park unlimited views of the Han River. It's popular for walks and with skateboarders who come to practice their flips and tricks. Another reason to come here is that the pier for the Han River sightseeing ferries are located about 300-400 meters away from the Meto station."
Han River views make it worth the trip,"There's not much to see in Yeouido Hangang Park itself; it's the view of Yeouido Tower and above all of the Han River that makes a visit to the park worthwhile; that, and the Han River cruise that you can embark on from the edge of the park. On a sunny summer evening, this could be the perfect place for a little picnic, if it's not too hot and humid (as is all too often the case in Seoul). The only tricky thing is transportation, as you have to take a bus or a taxicab to and from the park, since there is no nearby subway station."
My favorite place to be in Seoul.,"Yeouido Hangang Park is just like Battery Park in New York. It is close to the central business district (Yeouido has its own Wall Street nearby) and it has: nice breezes, green grass, perfect sunset, and lots of photo-ops!"
Beautiful and user-friendly,"The park goes all the way around the island. I live in another part of the city, but I sometimes take a bus to Yeouido just to go for a walk here. There are places along the way where the greenery closes above you. The views across the water are also great."
Beautiful Park,"Greeted by flyers of fried chicken once we came out from the Yeouido subway station. But the fried chickens had to be order through phone calls and we couldnt speak Korean. Luckily there was a Korean guy offered help to call, but we had to wait for 40 minutes for the delivery. (Alright I shall stop the Fried chicken story)We took the cruise at 9pm, 9600 won after discount, and it took about 30 minutes, where you could enjoy night scenery along the Han river, had a close look at the bridges beneath them. Enjoyed the night cruise. It's a soothing one. There might have little concerts and people would throw their support there. Quite a happening park but does not lose its serenity. Can ride a bike or do picnics there, just like the locals do! A wonderful place for picnic yeah!"
Beautiful Park in the Financial District,"This is a lovely park with nice paths, small ponds and lots of grassy space. It is also near the Hangong River. I found it very safe to walk,alone, even after dark. There were many people walking and even picnicking in the evening. "
Check out what festivals are happening.,"While the park is awesome when there are activities or festivals (fairly frequent) going on, its not worth a special trip if you're visiting Seoul."
Normal Park,"It was a normal park in the middle of the city area, but maybe a good place to view cherry blossom in full bloom"
not much,the garden of yeouido at hangang park is not as pretty as at yeouido park. I think better you visit the Yeouido garden than hangang park except you want to get a boat tour.
A small but nice park,This place is great for having a picnic and it's conveniently located near the IFC Mall! You can ride your bike along the bike paths or play basketball as well! The plants and flowers are well taken care of too.
Beautiful park on the Han River,"The entire Yeouido Park area is just a great place to rest, relax and meditate. It is in the shape of a T. Yeouido Park is the stem of the T, and the Hangam Park area runs along the water. Lots of native trees, grass and plants and flowers. Walking, biking trails, benches and tranquil view of the Han River. Take the metro, line 5, purple and when you exit the park is right in front of you. Hopefully if you are visiting and have the time between sightseeing and shopping, this is a great respite from the hectic Seoul."
No sakura,"Went there at april to see sakuraThere nothing thereOnly a few tree with a little sakura thereDont go there if u want to see some cherry blossom treeOther than that, i think around april there always a festival there"
Cherry Blossom Time,"Visited the park and the surrounding area in April, cherry blossom time and found it to be a great place for a relaxing time. . . Like most of the other parks in seoul , this one is also nice and safe. The line of flowers during the festival made it a treat to watch .A 5 min walk from the nearest subway station. "
A great park for bike riding or picnics...,This is an area that has some really good views with the cherry blossom trees and its a park and clean and nice and you have to make it something good by making a picnic out of it or making it special by riding a bike... Its worth seeing and doing but there are alot of people in this area during cherry blossom season and also weekends. This a great place for families and for couples.
A pleasant walk through natural beauty of Korea,"The weather was gloomy, but did not effect the great time I had there. Very clean and safe, a fun visit if you have a few hours to enjoy seeing the natural beauty of Korea."
It's a park,"Like most of Seoul Tourist stuff, it's clean and high quality. It's nothing spectacular, because it's a park. It's just very good at what it does. Good for picnics, good for hanging out, good for the sun, for dog walking, relaxing. Spacious, and i'm pretty sure there's free access to wifi across most of it."
"take a break, cycling","another landmark of seoul, very beautiful and many korean are here. this is a very good place for relaxing, exercise, cycling and picnic. rent a biscycle is around 3000 krw per hour. "
Great for bike riding and picnics,"If you want somewhere pleasant and outdoors to hang out for a picnic in Seoul, this is a great place, particularly in the humid summer, when you'll appreciate the open space and the chance of a breeze. The Han is an impressively wide river, and is framed by the skyscrapers of Yeouido. There's a wide grassy area between the street and the river, so plenty of space to throw down a blanket, pop an bottle of wine, and chill out in the sun. Hangang park extends for miles in each direction, and is pretty much one giant cycle path, so if you have a bike, this is a great place to get exercise in peace and safety, without having to tackle the potential nightmare of cycling on the roads of central Seoul."
Ride a bike!,Riding along the Han is one of my favourite things to do in Korea. Rent a bike and go exploring. Order some pizza or chicken and have it delivered to you at the park while you watch the water display at Banpo Bridge or a show on the floating stage.
Superb park where the old meets the new...so peaceful and tranquil,"Trees in blossom, very neat and tidy. Some superb traditional wooden structures, layout and information in both Korean and English. Nothing to dislike"
It's Spring!! Great Park for Chilling~,Has been knowing this park from Running Man and wanting to come here for a look. Luckily the time of my visit was during spring. Slightly sunny day and windy. Should have bring some snacks along to have a mini picnic with my deary friend. This park is ideal for outdoor activities. Saw some people setting up tent on the park. How I wish I can do that too!!! like overnight in the middle of the park and the weather/environment is chilling. cooool~
A park for all,Truly an ideal park for outdoor activity. Bringing families and friends are advised especially on weekends/holiday. A special bike track or skateboard and the like is available. Restaurants/cafes are also within walking distance. The view to any directions is fantastic. 
Go For a Walk/Cycling/Picnic/Admire Gangbuk from This Beautiful Park.,"I walked to this park from Yeouido Park - and was impressed by the size of this park. Overlooking Hangang, you can go for a stroll, rent a bicycle, have a picnic, or simply sit anywhere in the park to admire the gorgeous city view and Gangbuk from this side of the city. With a good weather, I can only imagine how lovely it would be walking from one end to the other in this park at night - that will be in my list during my next visit for sure! :)It's near to subway stations (Yeouinaru and Yeouido stations), cafes, stalls. Super clean."
great place to chill,visited the park during the early part of the cherry blossom season and was lucky to see the beginnings of the blooming! grab a chicken and beer leaflet from one of the ajummas hanging around the subway station exits and order some fried chicken to munch on while relaxing by the riverside!
Nice,"Nice and pretty place in a spring season, you can see a lot of cherryblossom .. you can also find many traditional foods, but difficult to find Halal foods (for moslem)"
Bring a picnic lunch!,"Great spot to relax and people watch! This park connects to the river and the extensive bike trails in Seoul. It is a great place to hang out with friends, go for a run, or a bike ride."
Interesting,It was nice to see the older building preserved and restored. The shops and restaurants in the area were also interesting.It isn't hard to find and is worth the walk.
Suffocated by crowds,Actually the cherries were not fully blossomed when we went . The crowds were absolutely suffocating so the whole experience was a miss for us.
Pretty Cherry Blossoms,"We are so fortunate that the cherry flowers waited for us :) The pretty numerous flowers from the strip of many cherry blossoms trees welcome us, telling us enjoy and take a lot of pictures until you can :) The lights which added shimmer to the cherry flowers made it more magnificent and captivating."
Great Cherry Blossom Street,"There is some cherry blossom inside the park, but there is a long long cherry blossom street just next to the KBS building, this is great for photo taking"
Cherry Blossoms,Went here to catch the cherry blossoms and it definitely did not disappoint. A good place to spend the afternoon by the Hangang River. Yeouinaru Station on Line 5 Exit 1.
Sakura is amazing,what a amazing view of Sakura of Yeouido Hangang Park. I went there on week day. So not that many people there that I could take many many photos with my wife. It's cold out there because that park is located beside the Hangang river. Be careful of getting cold when you get there.
Nice for walking and running,We were fortunate to have stayed in Yeouido so we were able to get there on foot and run along the path beside the Hangang River. We went for early morning runs so the path wasn't crowded at all. The park is very well maintained.
Peaceful and nice view,"It's very peaceful park. Super big that your legs get tired walking around. There is bicycle for rent (I think it's for rent, didn't go to ask for the fee and condition). The han river is very nice, it's quite chill and windy, so make sure you wear long-sleeve shirts or sweater (I was there in April)"
Eco-lung in Seoul,"Although rather concrete, there is quite a lot of grass and trees (especially good in flowering season) where you can wander in relative tranquility."
Beautiful Park,Long lanes to walk/Bike thru to see all the different areas of the park. A great place to bring a blanket and enjoy some sun on a patch of grass or a picnic with a S/O. Has areas to play basket ball or hold a stage for live music and a festival. I happened to be there on April 12th and it was the first day of the Cherry blossom festival. 
Excellent for unwinding,"Excellent grounds for walking, running, cycling, picnicking or simply to chill. About 2+km circuit around the park. There are also mini parks within. Cherry blossoms were starting to come up. Have an icecream, coffee, redbean fish cake - it's all good."
Cherry Blossoms!,We really didn't do to Yeouido Hangang Park for anything but cherry blossoms! we would have loved to bike around if the schedule permits us to do so.
Beautiful blossoms,Probably the most well-known place to see cherry blossoms in the spring in Korea; not sure if it's the best. Crowds are overbearing as all of Seoul comes there within those couple weeks. Other than that there is nothing special about the park.
Beautiful park to visit especially during cherry blossom,"A beautiful park. You can rent a bike and enjoy the park especially during Cherry blossom, especially along the river. "
good place to relax,"This was a great park to relax. Very spacious and clean, with the Han river right in front of you. It was pretty warm when we went, and around lunch time. We saw a lot of office workers, (maybe?) in their suits walking around. Right across the street is the Yeouido Park were many walk for a little exercise during their lunch break. I didnt know if it was fog or smog, but it was pretty foggy when we were there even though the sun was high. Yeouinaru Station exit 2 or 3 will get you to the Yeouido Hangang Park. "
Good place for picnic,"If you have visited all the major tourist attractions in Seoul and wonder what else you can do, you can visit this park and rent a bicycle to cycle around the park. The Yeouido park is linked to Hangang park. We did not have a picnic there but saw many groups of people sitting on the grass and just enjoying the breeze. KBS station is nearby so if you are a fan of Korean varieties show or drama, you can walk to the station for some photos. The radio station has a glass window and the studio is visible from the outside on the ground floor. If you are lucky, you may spot some Kpop stars."
"Mediocre food, cool breeze.","If you are not looking for great quality food, you can eat at one of the food court at the park. Otherwise, I recommend to bring your own food or get something instant from convenient stores."
Relaxing Place,The most relaxing place there is.. Dont forget to rent a bike and cycle along the park.Negative review would be the Korean cyclists.. So fast!! Yeah they ride the bike so fast.. So find the place where they are few cyclist around so u can enjoy ur ride.. Bring along a tent if u got one.
"Chill, cycle","This is a place to chill at night, sunset is beautiful, you can picnic with loved ones, have dinner on one of the boat cruises, enjoy street performances! Best of all, rent a bike and cycle along the Hangang with the locals. Bike rental is affordable and the bikes are very new and comfortable to cycle on! One thing to remember is the river is quite long, so if you would like to complete the entire cycling route, you might want to rent the bike for one whole day, or at least 4 hours (which is still rather inexpensive), considering that you would need time to travel back to the rental shop.If you get lost, the good news is that bikes are allowed onto metros, you can easily find the nearest metro station and take the metro back to the Yeouido station, which is only a few minutes away from the rental shop. Bring a photo ID along, you'll need to deposit it with the rental shop and will get it back when you return the bike.PS couples, young families and friends will definitely enjoy picnics here"
It's beyond description.,"A lovely park with gorgeous scenery. The park itself is clean and spacious. It's a great place for gathering, resting, relaxing or perhaps everything! There is a huge water pool and a fountain in the middle of the park, and everyone is welcome to have fun in the water. It's just amazing. A stroll along the park not only brought you the beautiful scenery of Han River but also the picture of how it's like to live in Seoul. It's just so vibrant and lovely. Do visit the park in the evening and come back at nighttime as well. The sunset and the night scene are just amazing. I will certainly come back when i visit Seoul again."
Clean park with lots of open space,I was there in early September and it was hot. Nice place to do a picnic. You can rent a bicycle to cycle around the park but the condition of the bicycles are not that good. Best to visit in the evening. 
Great place to chill with activities around!,"Went in August so it was still slightly warm but that didn't stop locals from coming to the park with their picnic baskets, tents, mats and bicycles.You can rent bikes, jet ski or take their Han River cruise.It's a really nice place to chill if you're on free&easy and need some time to just relax.You'll see locals here just chilling in their tents while their kids run around, couples cuddling together and friends cycling together."
Beyond beautiful,"I went in May period where the weather was a decent 25-30 degree celcius range and my gosh does it make for an amazing experience! Yeouido Park isn't just simply some nice green with couples, friends and family sprawled out all across the bank (many who bring portable BBQs and tents to shield their pale skin even more from the sun ;)), it's also filled with bicycle rentals for you to enjoy a large portion of the river (bikes for solos and also 'couple' bikes hehe - seoul is renowned for their strong 'couple' culture), there's a man-made pool in the middle of it all with interesting architecture all around. Must go during the day and at night! I witnessed a proposal as well! So there's always plenty going on including buskers, food stalls and much more! Make this a destination!"
Let's Go Fly A Kite!,"Kites are everywhere in the springtime and summer. The park is extremely close the 63 building. It is always teeming with people. Perfect during the cherry blossom season, but also quite crowded. I loved taking a blanket and picnic basket and simply spending the day out by the river. You can also rent bikes there. And it was also nice to see families spending time together since everyone works so hard in Seoul."
Great place to see the Cherry Blossoms,"Both times I went was during the Cherry Blossom period (Apr) so the whole stretch was filled with blooming flowers with festival celebrating the coming of Spring. It is a great place for couples and phototaking, but I would recommend to just go there for the Cherry Blossoms. :)"
I go every time when in Seoul,"When it comes to Seoul, I'm usually all just about food and shopping, but my Korean friend took me here one time (soooo close to the subway station, literally, you walk out and you're there), and from then on every time I'm back in Seoul I HAVE to come back here.On weekends (not sure about weekdays), they usually have these young musicians / singers playing music right down the stairs by the Han river, and there are loads of young people hanging out there... The atmosphere is just awesome, especially if you're there to watch the sunset.Another time I went at midnight - Seoul is like super safe, that night we saw 4 different police vehicles and similar objects driving before us every 3 minutes, I genuinely thought they were having an outing that night or sth :P - got fried chicken and beer (totally korean style), and it was still a great hangout place even though there weren't that many people.If any doubts, seriously, just go, you won't regret it, worst comes to worst, just go back into the subway station which is like 30-90 seconds away depending on how quickly you walk :P"
Cherry Blossoms!,Great timing as the Cherry Blossoms were in full bloom at the time of our visit. There are picnic areas all over the park and the view of the water is great. Take Line 5 (purple line) and get off at Yeouinaru.
"A nice place to ride a bike, though a bit crowded.","This is a lovely place for a bike ride, and there are plenty of rental bikes -- cruisers, mountain bikes, tandems, and kids bikes. It's nice that it has decent bathroom facilities every so often to stop at also. Two things to note:1. I'm 5'10"", and it turns out most of their cruiser bikes were really too small for me to ride comfortably. The frames seemed small and their seatposts were too short to safely extend as high as I would need. I ended up paying the extra 2K won per hour to rent a mountain bike which fit much better, but it was totally worth it for a more comfortable fit.2. The paths were quite busy with riders and walkers when we visited on a Sunday, with riders of all levels and speeds -- from young couples flirting and weaving slowly on tandems to riders in full road racing kit (oddly, most on high-end mountain bikes) riding a little aggressively. So, small children will need active supervision or be on the back of a tandem bike.Overall, a nice bike ride by the Han river with lovely flowering trees."
Biking in Yeouido Hangang Park,I love biking to Yeouido along the Han river (hangang). Here is what it looks like to bike to Yeouido: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUFNa3gn3nQ
