Hip place,"Daehangno is well known for the theatre in Marronnier Park, the Naksan Park, and Ihwa Mural Village. The closest subway to these places is Hyehwa Station. The theatre is the centre where many people gather to watch and enjoy free outdoor performances which are performed by students or young people on weekends. There are many restaurants and cafes to keep the night lively."
"Nice area for theatre, dinner and drinks","Like Hongdae and Sinchon at the opposite end of Gangbuk, Daehangno has a distinctively youthful and laid back vibe, with shops and F&B places catering mainly to University students and young adults. The area is rather quiet even on weekend mornings, with crowds building up only 4pm streaming into the cinemas and many cafes in the neighbourhood. Walk away from the shops and cafes to visit the Ihwa mural village which has colorful, witty pictures handpainted on the walls of old buildings, returning to Daehangno in the evening for dinner and drinks. Those who do not fancy Korean food or Korean version of American grub may opt for one of several Thai and Vietnamese resthurants in the area. The pubs with alfresco seating offering craft beers, sausages and tapas are worth checking out too."
Great place with a nice park,"Great artistic place with many small theartres. Many restaurants, coffee shops, perfect place to meet friends, good place for a date."
Vibrant place,"This place is opposite to SNUH and adjacent to Korea Open university, Marronier park. The place is very vibrant, with multiple options of food and shopping outlets. Multiple beauty shops and shops selling clothes are there. However, things are more costly here. "
Attractive place for young people,"It is just 15 minutes walk from Dongdaemun. Many arts were installed along the road which is quite attractive and humour sometimes. Many restaurants could be found, especially there are several Korean Barbecue and desserts shops. Fashion and Stationery shops could also be found here."
ideal for a relaxing walk,"A very interesting district with lots of nice street arts, cafes and little shops, as well as cherry blossoms at the right timing in spring"
Daehagno,It is really one of the most underrated neighborhoods in Seoul. This place breathes art! A place for college students because of all colleges around. Lots of restaurants can be found and some shopping as well.
delicious coffee shops and hippie shops,"if you want good coffee, come here. if you want to see some art work, come here. its got really good places to eat, and see some amazing plays. "
Shopping Street around University Area,"A lot of shops, eg. cloths, shoes, accessories, etc. around Daehakro or University area. Also have a lot of arts halls too."
Authentic neighbourhood,"It's one of the underrated neighbourhood in Seoul. We went there after visiting Gyeongbok palace and Bukchon. In different with Hongdae, Gangnam, Myeongdong, it's more like a authentic neighbourhood with lot's of restaurants, cafes and bars with cheaper prices. It's also nice place for a walk after dinner. Besides, Daehangno is famous with a lots of theatres, it's possible to get a ticket after dinner. Here's another place where people can spend their night life here."
Great place for going out !,"There are a lot of restaurants, pubs, bars and theaters. Also you can buy lots of things on the streets. Also there is a painting-wall village near here so there are a lot of travelers and tourists. worth visiting."
For Play Lover,"This place is very famous for the play. You can check out theaters, but mainly they perform in Korean. I do not know whether they offer translation or not. But if you have time, go and enjoy! There are some good places to eat out too."
One of the city's most underrated neighborhood,"Daehangno doesn't usually come on top of Seoul's touristic attraction list, but it definitely should. In such a small district, you can experience different facets of Korea's cultural, nighlife and culinary scenes. On the west end, you have Sungkyunkwan University (Korea's oldest higher-learning institution) and it's university street, food of shops and affordable restaurants and bars. In the middle, the actual daehangno, which is Korea's Broadway, since it has the country's highest concentration of theaters and music halls. On the East side of the street, you'll find bustling Streets with a vibrant nightlife. More accessible than Gangnam, more authentic than Itaewon, more stylish than Hongdae, it features bars, restaurants, music venues and stores of all kinds. If you head East even more, you'll reach Naksan Park, which is actually more of all small mountain, and offers amazing views of Northern Seoul ; as well as the lovely Indie Iwha neighborhood."
Philippine outdoor market at Daehangno,Daehangno is a nice place to spend an afternoon walking around the restaurants and shops but on Sunday afternoons Filipino vendors sell all kinds of products from the Philippines as well as some harder to find western products. Lots of street food. Relatively sanitary...i.e. I haven't gotten sick eating any of the street for there. It's only a couple of blocks long but there are many side streets in the area with lots of shops.
Great way to knock off some of the day,"Something for everyone. Excellent street food, coffee shops, restaurants and stores. Usually very crowded but this adds to the experience. Good variety for family as well. If you are looking for a spot to entertain your family for a few hours - really good spot to spend part of a day. "
Here is the street with the young and romance,"Do you like performances like play, concert or musical? Especially if you want to watch a play with your lover, friend or family, and go to a nice and intimate restaurant for dinner, don't hesitate to visit Daehakro. I bet you will have a successful date. Here is the young street full of romance! It is close to Changedeokgung Palace and Changgyeonggung Palace, and also close to the downtown Jongro area."
Seoul's Cultural Center,"Known as Seoul's theater district, off course Daehangno is filled with local cafes, shops, and a lot of local youngsters.Daehangno is a hidden gem, very nice place. A lot of shops uniquely decorate their place so I can't stop snapping my camera :)You must visit here if you love to catch some music and performing art shows (or not), or you can just strolling around with a lot of shops and cafes nearby."
Street for young people,"Known as the street for young people, also ""Play Mecca"". It's like cultural center of Seoul. You will see lots of small theater all over the place when you visit this area. One of the famous thing in here, ""Sunday Filipino Market"" open every Sunday. http://travel.cnn.com/seoul/visit/filipino-market-429413I love more than any other places in Seoul. In fact, I live in here!"
bit of young Korean culture?,"Daehangno - means University road. there are 2 or 3 major university aroundfull of young people on the street day and night. Food and drinks are cheaper compare to south side of the river. full of small theaters, little concert halls around the park as well as bars and restaurants. it used to be number 1 night out destination but I think Gangnam and Hongdae took over now tho..."
Nice and Probably Better if Better Planned,"Lured by the possibility of catching an interesting show or jazz performance, we headed to Daehangno one evening for some food and entertainment. It was too late to follow the walking tour guide of the Seoul Metropolitan Government (which takes you around public areas and places to eat), so we just explored the immediate area around Hyehwa station. We were drawn by the small stores selling clothes, shoes and make-up; saw plenty of restaurants that seemed to cater to a younger set (hence, cheaper – and they have Saboten!); and generally liked the atmosphere of the town -- busy, bright and not too touristy. Unfortunately, because we sort of jumped right in without carefully considering where to go and what to do, we ended up in a so-so chicken stew restaurant where the staff only spoke Korean. We were also unable to find a jazz bar or a non-verbal performance theater where our lack of Korean language skills wouldn't matter. In short, we ended up going home after a meal and some accidental/incidental window shopping. I believe this place deserves another look after more careful research and planning. I'm coming back in the mid-afternoon so I can follow the official walking guide. There are a few interesting daytime places in Hyehwa – there’s a palace/botanical garden, Sungkyunkwan University and a pretty park."
Heart of Korea's Theatrical Culture,"If New York has broadway, Seoul has Daehakro. Unfortunately, most theatres are limited to sketch show types and not many musical in this area. Also, all shows are in Korea. So this may limit your experience depending on your language skill.However, this area has other things to offer many cheap good quality restaurants owing to its proximity to SungKyunKwan University and very long time ago(1970s ish) Seoul National Uni(now moved to South Seoul). Whilst Seoul National Uni main campus has moved down south, its medical school has stayed put. It's one of the top 3 hospitals in Korea with extremely skilled physicians and surgeons. So if you are visiting this hopspital elective/ fellowship training etc this area cannot be avoided.In terms of accommodation, there is not much accommodation close to this area unfortunately. But easily accessible by line no. 4(blue) which is the name same line as Myoung-Dong, Dongdae Mun and Yong San."
famous street for the plays,"it is one of best areas to enjoy"" play "" of th etheater however, I am not sure if it is same to foreign visitors. atmosphere of the street is very animated in the evening"
Seoul Daehakno (University Avenue),"Its Street name: Daehangno, a.k.a. University Street. (Named for the Seoul National Universities College of Liberal Arts and Science that once stood here; now only the medical school remains). That is awesome place. I can enjoy a lot of play... very cool..."
