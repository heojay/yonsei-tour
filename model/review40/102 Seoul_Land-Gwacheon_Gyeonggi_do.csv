Dated but still fun,This amusement park is older and dated but it was still fun as there was not really any lines for any of the attractions. You will notice that many younger children or families go to this amusement park however it is still good for all ages as there are rides for children and those who are older.
After visiting Seoul Park you definitely need to visit Seoul Land which is right next door,"download Klook and buy entry ticket which is a lot cheaper than buying at the entrance, you can do this even if you are already at the entrance and its great to redeem the tickets immediately. We went on Easter Friday but the park was not as full n crowded as Everland so way way more fun in Seoul Land.Very large park with lots of rides and things for the whole family to enjoy, its enough for a full day outing, many many restaurants inside to choose from for eating."
Fun Park to Visit While In Seoul,"This park is in the Seoul Grand Park area not far from the Zoo and has some really cool rides including 3 roller coasters. The nice thing about this park is that since most people go to Lotte World and Everland, it doesn't get as crowded. There's a good mix of rides with something for everyone. "
Splendid time at Seoul land,"The place is suitable for both young children and adult. Many attraction can be played by all family members. The place is big enough for us to spend full time and play same attraction several times. The crowd was less than I expected and we were lucky for that. Overall, we were happy to get the chance to play all the attractions with beautiful view of autumn scenery along the way to Seoul Land by walk, or by sky lift from nearby station."
Close to Seoul with great public transport leading to the theme park,"Although this is one of the most convenient theme parks to go to in Seoul/Gyeonggi-do, it lacks a real crowd drawing ride. Kinda like Lotte World's lesser cousin.A good place to go when you have nothing else to do or are unable to go to Lotte World of Everland."
view,the trip is nice to go down of the hill and the view is lovely .. you can see the park and lack and trees and mounting 
Seoul Land Amusement Park,This is an outdoor amusement park. Highly recommended for kids and you have many rides that you can enjoy without queuing for long.Many local food stalls within the park and you will not go hungry.
The theme park is big,"This is a outdoor theme park consist of different kind of themes for children. If you would like to have fun with your children, this is one of a good choose for you. But it is a bit cold in winter."
Short queues and not crowded at all,"Maybe this theme is old already or maybe I came during winter, or maybe combination of both. There is really very little people in this theme park. There is so little people that I believe because of it many of the rides is closed or seems closed. But if you approach the rides some of them is actually open and the staff will return and operate it. (they seems to be talking to other staff which also their rides have no guest riding it lol)A little anti climax since the mood is so different from lotte world or everland, but a very good point here is that you can practically ride everything that is operating even if we came at noon time because there is no queues mostly. Only thing to note is many street food stall is closed so you have to eat at their restaurant, which is also empty, so don't come here on empty stomach.Everything is old and such don't expect pretty stuff, but during winter, they have ice sledge which in my opinion is the most fun ride and worth coming. No waiting time, can play as much as you want, I will not grade this theme park higher or lower than everland, both are as good, just different expectations."
Ice sledding and more,"Very near Gangnam District in Seoul.Just show the Korean address of Seoul Land to the taxi driver and you'll be there in 20 to 30 minutes. The staff at the main Information Office at Seoul Land just before the entrance are very accommodating and helpful, and they speak good English too. We asked for a taxi from Seoul Land back to the hotel and we waited not more than 10 minutes. Great!"
For babies!,"This place is definitely for kids, probably younger than 6 or 7 years old. Rides are not exciting or thrilling at all. Boring."
Better than Everland or Lotte World (for younger kids)!!,"The place is so deserted and empty when we went on a weekday. Perhaps the rides are more suitable for younger children (5-12 years old) or its not as popular as the other 2 theme parks. Or maybe some of the rides are abit run down.There are probably only less than 80 people during our visit and my kids can repeat the same ride 6 times without ridiculous queue. Mostly younger kids like 12-15 years old and lesser couples. They have a huge rollercoaster and drop down just like the popular theme park. Price is half compared to Lotte World when you purchase through KLOOK app. Super worth it and you need walk 3 mins after exit from train station to take the elephant ride to the theme park. Or walk to park in 15 mins. There are restaurants, 7-11, cafes and 1 halal Kebab stall (near Tomorrow Land). For muslims, there is a dedicated musollah near 7-11, please ask the staff to open the door for you. Very clean and spacious with separate rooms, however we can't use the tap so its handy to bring a bottle of clean water."
Enjoyed ,We has fun with our parents and young children . The sky lift was too short and expensive though but had good experience . Visit in clear day .
Amazing place to go to for fun and culture,"This place is absolutly amazing, i went on both the big rides and walked around looking at all the cool exhibits that they had such as an village styled from the past, which served some delicious BBQ chicken kebabs, everywhere i went i saw people having fun and children laughing, made me feel happy to be able to visit this amusement park"
Amazing TOUR to Seoul Land!,"I love the kmovie My Sassy Girl so much! ^So I book a discount ticket online to Seoul Land. It's really big and beautiful! What impressed most is the Sky-X! It's great damn fun! The fee is not included in admission. I enjoy the tour so much! By the way, I book the ticket on Hulutrip, it was so fast and easy^"
Great Value,"Multicultural families in Korea can get half-price yearly passes and foreigners visiting Korea can get great deals on tourist websites. Seoul Land is a bit tired and needs a bit of TLC, but there is plenty to do and the kids love it. My 6 and 7 year old can go on most rides. Parking is free during the week and the surrounding mountain views are really pretty. For a full day experience, combine Seoul Land with the Grand Park (zoo). We love the rollercoasters, flume ride and Larva Twister the most. Food and beverages are not too expensive and outside food is allowed in, if you prefer to have a picnic. There are lots of water fountains too. "
Love this place !,"Very nice place. My family loves these old theme parks - nostalgic, not that crowded, not much queue and traditional rides.Have been going to these old parks in Japan and continue to do so in Seoul.There's a zoo in the same area if time permits too."
A lil old but worth the visit!,Although the facilities seems to be a lil old - it's still great. The rollercoasters are not that bad. Love the viking - felt more thrilling than the rollercoaster rides actually. The view walking from the subway to Seoul Land is amazing and breathtaking - especially during sunset.
Great for young kids,"I have visited Lotte world and Everland every time I visited Korea. However, this year i choose Seoul Land. We spend 4 hours in Seoul Land and my kids really enjoy themselves. You can reach there by the subway.Comparing to Lotte World and Everland, the entrance fees is a lot more cheaper."
Not recommendable in winter season,"Because of cold weather and small number of visitor, some rides are not operated. Parade and events were not lively compare to other season"
Amazing,Came here to try the 2 famous rollercoster.. And all beyond what I'm expected.. It is really nice to spend our hole day in here.. So many attractions and and much places to take a photo..
Sunday funday,The place was good had a great time but the majority of the park was for children. Snacks inside the park were great. Would recommended it for a day of fun. 
Just nice.,"I visited little word the past year and didn't enjoy it as much as Seoul Land. In Seoul land, everything is outdoors and going during spring is perfect. There weren't too many rides nor too little. I enjoy Seoul land because you don't have to spend an entire day at the theme park. Thus giving you more time to explore the country. I paid W10 000 because I went with a Korean friend who had a discount card. I recommend trying the grilled butter squid while waiting in some queues and a nice bowl of pat bingsoo or shaved ice, after the rides as a way to cool down. We packed our own lunch because we were Saving on cost. There Are plenty of rest areas there. NOTE: DO NOT ENTER THE HAUNTED HOUSE. it isn't your typical haunted house. Everything is in Korean and you enter in groups of 20. There is a 'guide' who will take you they several rooms but nothing really scares you. I waited 1.5 hours in line for it but I wasted my time. We spent less than 5 minutes in the haunted house. Other than, I thoroughly enjoyed my time there ^^"
A day at amusement park,"Im very happy the ticket price for foreigner is cheap. Rides is ok. Not much of choices. Food selection is normal for a park. Ice cream, corn dog etc.. good for a day trip to bring your children during weekend. Less foreigners. "
Super fun trip with friends,"Went here with a group of friends and had a great time! Going through the zoo was nice, and there were a few fun rides to go on in the park itself. You can get special discounts through Kakao Talk if you're able to read Korean!"
"great kid's destination, good value and variety amusement park","we visited Tokyo Disneyland, Seoul Land, and Lotte World on the same vacation (right, two countries) and my 6 year old son loved Seoul Land the most by far. the rides were great, versions of lots of classics for kids at every age (his problem with Disney, which is better for 10 year olds that are really into those characters). the cost wasn't high either, for entry or food, and lines weren't so bad (main rides lines could be long at times). they even had a kids play area so that we could get out of the rides and lines mode for awhile (a playground theme place, there was also a day-care indoor version we didn't use). it reminded me of the classic parks I visited as a child, kind of out of fashion in the US now since ever-bigger rides and commercial themes have taken over."
"Incredibly laid-back, enjoyable amusement park","My wife and I went here with her brother and his wife while we were visiting their family in Seoul. Compared to most amusement parks in the US, it was incredibly clean, well maintained, and efficiently run. We never waited more than a minute or two to board the rides, and thoroughly enjoyed the ""sky tram"" ride that gives you an aerial view of the park. Food was reasonably priced and delicious. Make sure to take pictures with the ""Gangster"" stockades in the center area; always good for a laugh!"
Fun place for younger kids,"We went on a Monday morning to avoid the crowd but surprised to find that the amusement park was quite deserted. My 2 kids have fun but some of the rides were not opened, don't know if it's due to the winter season. I find that most of the rides are more suitable for children of age 3-10 years old. We missed the snow sledding timing, a real pity as it looked fun!"
An option if you have kids,This park looks older than Lotte World but it has a zoo there and less crowded. There are the usual roller coaster rides but some of them might be closed during the low peak season.There is a science museum opposite the park which can be an place to go after the park
Loved it,I love the amusement parks here...no extremely long lines or outrageous prices. This time we (foreigners) got half price admission. Very well worth the trip and excitement. Very family oriented and the food is not bad. The trick is picking something you know you like before trying something new. 
Fun Date Spot,"I came here on a date the day after Chuseok and there were a ton of people there! This is the oldest amusement park in South Korea, but it doesn't feel dated. I had more fun here than at Everland. There are more attractions and the energy in the place was more potent than I experienced at Everland and Lotte World. There is very little shade though...so go prepared with tons of water. The food options are traditional Korean food. For some reason I was expecting theme-park food. After you have enjoyed your day here you can head over to Seoul Grand Park, which is another great location. There is accommodation available if you want to stay in the area as well."
Lovely place,I liked the palce very much. and I believe from time I visited the place ( it was 1999) it became even better. Excellent zoo and very nice amusement park makes it ideal for having a great day. you can also staying in the Seoul land cottages and plan your enjoyment there for couple of days as the territory is huge. one should plan visiting the place not in a hottest day as some areas need long walkings in open areas.
Nice zoo,"Its right next to the ""Seoul grand park"" subway station. The zoo has a sky lift and apart from usual animals , it features a dolphin show. There is a colourful-bird section dedicated to parrots. A trail runs among the mountains surrounding the zoo."
Military Family Goes to Seoul Land,"We are a military family with a 9yr old and a 3yr old. First tip - take the subway.....if you don't read anything else in this review, remember this....take the subway. It's easy, inexpensive, drops you off right at the Seoul Grand Park entrance, and you do not deal with any traffic at all. So, we took the subway, exited the station and walked about 1/2 mile to the tram station. 2,700 won later, we boarded the tram and the 2nd stop is Seoul Land (1st stop is the zoo). The tram ride is one way, it will cost you another 2,700 won to take it back. TIp #2 - pay the won and take the tram or 1/2 your day will be walking to and from the entrance. I have no idea why, and the website said we would have to pay close to 120,000 won, but they charged us 45,000 and we could ride all of the rides until the park closed. The park is dated, but for $40 for the entire family, how can you beat it? There are 3 big roller coasters, a bungey jump, Free Fall (for anyone who has ever been to a 6 flags), and a few other rides intense enough to make you want to throw your breakfast up. Tip #3 - This is very important.....If you littlest one is over 100cm, I would seriously pass on this amusement park. Our littlest one is 101cm and they measured him off prior to every single ride. Thank God he busted 100cm or else it would have been a very long, disappointing trip. We went expecting Seoul Land, not Disney, and not Busch Gardens. If you go there wanting to have a really cool afternoon with your kids, there is more than enough rides for every age group. No, it's not huge. No it's not Busch Gardens. Yes, we had a great day with our kids, spent about 7 hours at the park, with absolutely no lines, no hassle, and a very friendly staff willing to go out of their way to make it a special day. Tip #4 - If you are a Westerner, you may want to stick to the burger restaurants, but there is fried chicken, and a Turkish booth selling Kebabs and Gyros. With the subway, the tickets, the tram, lunch, snacks, drinks, and even a few toys, we paid around 100,000 total for our family of 4, no kidding. Last and final tip - Go!"
Winter Seoulland,"We went to Seoulland on Xmas eve 2012 and we absolutely love there. Though we came on a day where there was no Xmas performance, there wasn't any queue either. We hopped on to many rides countless of times and enjoyed ourselves in the chilling weather. There were gift shops and restaurants around. This is more of a 'local' amusement park where the locals hung out compared with Lotteworld or Everland. We enjoyed snow sledding there as well. Not as grand as Everland but the scenery and atmosphere made up for it =)"
Seoul Zoo,"Just went there today with my 2 children aged 10 and 8. It's a pretty interesting park with an amusement park in one section, the zoo in another. Had already read the comments on the zoo and no one mentioned that entrance into the zoo required cash or a korean card. I wanted to buy a package that included the sky lift (which was awesome!) and tram and zoo entrance with my canadian credit card and they said that the zoo entrance fee could not be paid by my credit card. The tram and skylift were separate and went through ok. There was one ATM machine but it does not work with north american cards. Zoo was ok. Yes the enclosures seemed small compared to our zoos. I can't comment on the animals. We have a world renowned zoo at home and they were all doing the same thing...sleeping.We enjoyed our trip and would come back and join all the active seniors just to do the hike up the mountain!Unlike many public places in north america, the washrooms are super clean as are all the subways!"
"Too old, but foreigners get a discount ticket for 10,000won","definitely don't go here in the winter. even going in march is not a smart move. i nearly lost my face when going on the rollercoasters, not from screaming but rather the ghastly icy wind gushing at my face. should seriously rethink going to any amusement attractions during winter!"
The beautiful maple leaves,"I went to see the maple leaves at seoul park together with my kids,my sister and nephew.Wow....the leaves all in red colour are so beautiful.I really love it very much.We took cable car with red roof-top up to the middle of the hill and you can see a lot of animals along the cable car goes up.Here we change the blue colour roof-top cable car up to the top of the hill.Here you can see a lot of maple trees with red leaves.There are few tourist so we can enjoyed the amazing scene without any disturbed.We went to the amusement park called ""Seoul Land"" too.Kids really love it because they can play many times as they want since there are just few people comes on Monday."
Seoul Land,"I went to Seoul Land with my family. I think there's the amusement park part and the zoo part. We went to the zoo part. Actually we were planning to go to the amusement park but we went there by accident. Anyways, it didn't cost that much. There were many animals. It wasn't bad... I guess we had a good time.But I think I would go to the amusement park next time if I have a chance."
just ok,"we took our 5 nieces and nephews here on Oct. 28 and the place was OK, I guess. As an American that has visited Disney Resort and Six Flags, this place is of much lower quality. The rides are very dated for an amusement park. There is one roller coaster that is Six Flags Quality and the rest of the place seems to be stuck in the 70's. For western visitors, I would say this would be a giant letdown. The food available is OK, but unless you have lived in Korea for a bit(i did for two years) and developed a taste for the local food, you may have trouble finding anything other than fried chicken. My advice for Westerners, take the kids to a temple or historic site where they can learn something about another culture. If you live in Korea, sorry this is what you have to put up with for an amusement park."
Old style theme park,"Seoul Land is an old style theme park with somewhat antiquated rides and games. Very few activities available but for a day out of school on a field trip, it fits the bill. Have accompanied my children there on several occasions and have never been impressed. Tight parking spaces and no pre determined traffic flow caused unnecessary traffinc jams when it came time to go home. Not really recommended."
Disney crosses paths with Six Flags,"Disclaimer: I have not been to Everland or Lotte World. However, as parks go, this was a great experience. First, mind the audience, which is for young people or families. Second, it is inexpensive. Third, it is an older park. Finally, the rides are more intense than their equivalent in the USA.We went on a Tuesday when it was cool and school is in. There were a number of young kids there on school trips and they were the only ""crowd"" to be had. It was very sparsely populated. The temperatures and short lines were great.We only paid 28,000 won for two people all day & all rides, though it was shown to be 32,000 per person for that ticket. That was a super deal and we got it at the counter. I don't know why. Additionally, the park food is very reasonably priced, just a smidge above street fair price.The park was built prior to the Olympics in Seoul and most of the rides are meant for younger people; however, they are more intense than their equivalent in the states. The flying carpet, pirate ship, ""frontal spinning ride"", two roller coasters, etc., are all worth it. If you go on a cool day when most the crowds will be minimal, you will have a blast!"
Terrible - not worth even the low entrance fee.,"My wife and I visited Seoul Land on Oct. 17, 2011. Having already been to Lotte World we were expecting something similar, but were disappointed. The park looks like a 40-year old Disney prototype that's been left to the elements for 5 years; there only seemed to be three rides intended for anyone over 6-7 years old. If in the area stick to the zoo, or if looking for an amusement park go to Everland or Lotte World."
