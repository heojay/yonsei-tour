Korean history,We visited this imposing memorial on the hop on hop off bus.It can be reached by local bus as well.There are several bronze memorials to the US Marines and South Korean army and an amphibious tractor and artillery displayed.The attached museum gives an interesting account of the 1950 Incheon landing that defeated the Communist North Koreans in the Korean War.
In need of an upgrade,"It is a very informative museum with everything you need to know about the most significant event during the Korean War. However, most displays haven’t changed in years and they can use some improvement."
"The Memorial Hall for Incheon Landing Operation, Incheon, S. Korea.","As a former member of the United States Marine Corps who in 1958, after the war, was attached to the 1st Marine Division, I wanted to see this museum at all costs. To do this, I got my wife and myself a hotel room for three nights at the Incheon International Airport so we would be relatively close to the museum. I studied how to get to the museum and off I went from our hotel on the Number 304 bus. I had planned to transfer to the number 8 bus but I simply could not figure out the connection after I left the number 304 bus. So I hired a taxi (U.S. $8). Money well spent. I don't think I would have ever found the museum off the number 8 bus. I also hired a taxi to return to catch a number 303 bus back to the airport.Every S. Korean won I spent, and every minute it took to visit the museum, were well worth the cost and the effort. The museum is FREE and it did not disappoint me in any shape or form. I began by visiting the exterior exhibits. Then I went inside to see the displays in the Memorial Hall. It was an outstanding and a deeply moving visit for me. Would a visit be for everyone? No. I feel you must have a sincere interest in the Korean War to enjoy the museum.BUT, immediately next door, just down the street, is The Incheon Metropolitan City Museum. I really enjoyed this Trip Advisor attraction a lot. So it is a very worthwhile attraction to visit even IF you are not interested in the Korean War.Bottom Line : How can you go wrong with two great attractions next door to one another"
MacArthur,This memorial is dedicated to the US beach landing at Incheon which helped turn the tide of the Korean War to the US/ROK favor. Lots of good military history here. 
Comprehensive museum that tells you everything you want to know about the landing,"This museum is a must for military war buffs. If you have any interest at all in the Korean War, this is the 2nd best place to visit in the Seoul area besides the excellent Korea Military Museum in Seoul. The Incheon Landing was the key to saving South Korea during the Korean War. It was risky but perfectly executed. The museum describes everything in detail. Several statues also show respect for this battle. The museum is quite a walk from the metro station but I managed. It takes about 30 minutes. It might be worth looking into a bus or taxi if you don't want to walk so far."
A historic few hours,"It was a nice smaller tribute to the war. I enjoyed the putdoor and in door stuff, well laid out. As an american visiting it was nice to see the view from an in country exhibit"
historical lover,"best time to go at evening, i happened to go there because I participated in walking event in summer, and the other time, because I want to see tulips to take a picture during spring"
Small scale model of the Incheon Landing operation,"I loved the displays and historical artifacts from the Incheon Landing. But I definitely love the beach landing representation of where the allied ships are, the troops, the aircrafts, it's totally amazing how the Koreans made this! Very well done and gives honor to the sacrifice and bravery of the Allied forces and their South Koreans who have fought and paid the price for their freedom. You should check it out. Free admission and parking. We parked toward the upper street above the museum."
look great from the outside,"I have been in this place several time, historically important for Koreans, but except for the memorial itself there is nothing so spectacular about the place. "
Great memorial,Another great memorial dedicated to the people involved in the Incheon landings. The memorial hall is very informative and its worth having enough time to go through. There are a few military displays of vehicles and replicas of critical moments during the landing. We caught a city bus from Songdo where we were staying.
Great exhibition ,"An easy 10 minutes walk from the songdo incheon line subway station, it's a free exhibition especially dedicated to sir Douglas mcarthur on the incheon landing operation (operation chromite), if you've watched the film it's a great reading addition to understand the background of it all. Loads of telegram info, detailed description. Loved it."
Free Museum: A must see for Military Buffs,"The museum is actually inside the tall structure. The museum is free, and takes about a good hour to tour everything. A lot of facts on the Incheon Landing and how the Amphibious Landing was planned and executed.This is also nearby the actual US Marine Corps Landing locations. "
Very Educational,Our family really enjoyed our time at this small but informative museum. We learned facts about the Korean War that are not well known or taught in American schools.
Good Museum with a great view of Songdo Bridge,"I was staying in an apartment near to the Incheon Airport, and decided to visit this museum. I was short on time and decided to take a taxi, which turned out to be quite an expensive option. The taxi charged 30,000 won, and it would have been much cheaper to take a public bus 4,000 won or airport limousine bus for 7,000 won. I was not disappointed by the museum, as the outdoor exhibits of a tank, jet, guns and various statues and monuments was very good. We had previously visited the Seoul War Memorial, which was excellent, and found this museum well planned, although not the size of the larger Seoul museum.Entry was free, and provided access to the museum and the outdoor exhibits. It should be noted that a visit to this museum is included in the free In Transit tours offered by Incheon Airport. There was another building to the left of the museum, which we later learned was a video room which needs to be booked in advance by groups only. On entering the museum it may be best to head to the video room which allows you to play a short video on the history of the Incheon landing and the Korean war in general. The video may be played in quite a few languages, including English.In the center of the main display area is a model of the General MacArthur lead invasion by sea, which we found to be quite detailed.There are many weapons from both sides on display, in addition to the items used daily by soldiers. There is a small section near to the exit which shows the Chinese involvement in the war, including a model of a Chinese soldier, and a few Chinese weapons. An hour should be enough to view the museum, and there are great views of the Songdo Bridge from the top of the steps of the museum, where there are more monuments. If time permits, there is a path behind the museum where a short walk offers a better view of the Songdo Bridge.A visit here may be combined with nearby Jayu Park, which has a statue of General MacArthur. This was one area of Incheon where we found it very difficult to get a taxi, and we had to walk for 5 minutes to the main road, before seeing a taxi. It may be a good plan to check bus routes before visiting this museum, as this seemed the most efficient transportation option in this area."
See a bit of history during your layover,"This is a great museum to visit during a layover. The Incheon International Airport has free tours. We took a 2 hour tour which went to this museum and also a temple. The museum has nice displays and a lot of history about the Korean war. It would have been nice to have more time here, but it was still worth the trip. Great views of Incheon as well. Piece of advice...time your trip well. We had a 12 hour layover and left the airport within an hour of landing. To go on the tours you have to clear customs. What we didn't realize was to get back through customs we needed a boarding pass. We ended up waiting 3 hours until the airline counter opened and we could get a boarding pass for our next flight. The rest of the airport is amazing, but don't make the same mistake we did!"
Of Great Historical Significance,"This is a must see for anyone visiting Incheon. It's near China town and it offers a glimpse into Incheon's liberation by the US during the Korean War. Definitely worth a visit, and it's free."
In memory of veterans,"I loved visiting this site. Very well laid out, well lit in the evening. Despite the noises of the city, it is a quiet place. There are explanations in English. Near the monument, there are ancient planes with their descriptions. Very interesting."
Great statue for a great cause,"This statue is located in liberty park, at the top end.At this statue, you can go down and reach the japanese era style part. Taking the right side will lead you to chinatown where you can catch the metro."
Moving memorial on the Inchon landing,"Too often our history is forgotten or overlooked. I remembered the landing from history books. My uncle was in the Korean conflict. Interesting that we cannot call it a war.The memorial is on the hill overlooking Inchon and has vehicles and statues to portray the conflict. Unfortunately the hall was closed during our visit.Still, without access to the hall it was a moving memorial to a wicked time in Korea."
A tribute to the soldiers,The memorial was erected to commemorate the struggle by the soldiers. The location on the hilly part of Incheon is good. 
"Well worth seeking out, especially for those interested in modern history","Although this is not easy particularly easy to find, it is worth making the effort, especially as you have another museum almost next door. It's quite a striking building, although the exhibition itself is not particularly extensive. Some of the signage and narrative is a little strange...and certainly very pro-South Korean....but that quirkiness added to the visit.Take the time to read and look at everything. It's quite fascinating.If you don't have a car, it might be worth taking a taxi."
Near to the Wolmi Gardens,Nice to see such great memorial statues within the park. They commemorate the different forces involved with different wars and issues.
Incheon Landing Memorial,The memorial is very informative of the Incheon Landing. It contains larger than life photos of the key players in the planning and execution of the battle. Captions are in Korean and English. There is a mockup of the battle that depicts many details of the landing. The bronze statues are life like and realistic. One can sense the intensity of the men as they climb over Incheon River embankment. There are many static displays of weaponry used over the years in the defense of South Korea through the grounds. 
Quick stop,We did this with a group of friends when we had a short layover. Wish I had more time as they have some great info and a film to watch. Amazing how much it has changed around there with all the fill in they have done. Nice change of pace instead of hanging out at the airport. Recommend it for anyone who wants to pass their time more constructively. 
Included in Incheon Airport Free Transit Tour,"If you have time to kill and not want to hang around Incheon Airport but get a some fresh air - join the 2 hour tour!I did it while in transit and it was a breeze. Shuttle and guide are all free from the airport. Good understanding of why Incheon was a key landmark in the Korean War back in the 50s. Was told by guide that Liam Neeson will play Korean War hero General Douglas MacArthur in the a new movie Operation Chromite that features Incheon Landing Operations, schedule to open next year."
Good for a short visit,Good place to go if you are in incheon...apart from the memorial there is also a museum..carry your hat as there are no shades except for the musuem hall
A detailed history of the Incheon landing,You'll find all the details of the Incheon landing here. It was interesting to see the amount of participation from the various UN countries. The US was by far the biggest participant. A very interesting exhibit. 
"Nothing special, but decent views","This memorial is unremarkable. Climbing the short 20 minute walk up the ""mountain"" behind the memorial does offer fantastic views of Songdo, Incheon Bridge, and the Yellow sea though, which can also be enjoyed to a lesser extent from the memorial itself. The neighborhood itself that the memorial is in is a red light district full of dozens of love hotels."
A great short visit,"If you're looking for something to pass the time for a couple hours, this museum is perfect. The inside showcases interesting historical accounts and artifacts, with an awesome interactive model of the Incheon landing operation. Outside are tanks, artillery guns, rockets, and even a jet plane. The culmination is the walk up to the eternal flame commemorating the many brave soldiers that fought and died during the operation and the war. If time allows, there is a short 20 minute hike up the hill behind the museum which leads to a breathtaking view of both Old and New Songdo and the Incheon Bridge. This trip is very entertaining for both adults and children (5 and up age appropriate)."
I enjoyed the peaceful aura of this place.,"Incheon Landing Operation Memorial Hall is a small,quiet,but an amazing energy,I sensed as I climbed the very steep stairs to the monument.It was constructed t commemorate the Incheon landing Operation at Wolmi Island,launched under the command of General MacAurthur( the Commander in Chief of the U.N Forces) during the Korean War.I really enjoyed the history surrounding this monument and the peaceful auras of this place."
Old fashioned,"We enjoyed this, but it is all black and white photos. I did get my photo taken with Douglas Mac arthur! "
If your interested in Korean War History,"This is not a large museum, and the grounds are quite small. The walk up to the monument is very steep. There is a small collection of machinery scattered around the grounds (go to the war memorial in Seoul to see a good collection). However to get a good perspective of Operation Chromite it is worth a look. There are a few interesting artefacts in the hall. If your not prepared to climb the hill behind the memorial, there are good views from the balcony. Go if you are in the area and enjoy history, otherwise you may be disappointed."
Peace and Quiet,"The memorial hall is a good place for visitors especially those who have watched the Korean TV series "" you came from the star"". There are also tanks, missiles, air fighters exhibits."
Interesting,On a stop over tour. My only knowledge of this topic was watching MASH.Interesting display. Steps not for the infirm!
Definitely a part of Korean and American history worth visiting and the view of Incheon and the Ocean is spectacular.,"Google Maps and Trip Advisor have this one dead on the money as far as location. Probably shouldn't use the new maps from apple though. You may fid yourself somewhere that isn't on the map. Other than that, this is a cheap and picturesque place to visit. I went in the beginning of October and it was extremely peaceful. Just imagine what it was like 62 years ago almost to the day."
A supplement to the War Memorial in Seoul,"The Memorial Hall for Incheon Landing Operation is located in Yeonsu-gu, Incheon where the most important UN operation in the war was conducted on September 15, 1950. It was a turning point in the war and the beginning of the UN offensive toward the north. For those who are interested in the Korean war (1950-1953) and wish to learn a little more about it and its impact that has shaped South Korea today, the Incheon Landing Memorial is worth a visit. Actually, it is a supplement to the Korean War Memorial in Seoul. Exhibitions include detailed description of the Incheon Landing Operation thru photos, document, war objects, military equipment and video shows. It is very difficult to mention the Incheon Landing Operation without referring to Gen Douglas MacArthur, then the UN Force Commander and mastermind of the landing. Drawing from his WWII experience of the US counter-offensive against Japan in the Pacific theater, especially his amphibious landing tactics, Gen MacArthur executed the Incheon Landing that saved the ROK and UN forces from total collapse and defeat.  About 10 km to the north of the Incheon Landing Memorial lies the much-toured China Town and the Peace Park, where Gen Douglas McArthur’s statue stands silently upon a hill overlooking Incheon. The former battle ground is now a park for rest and recreation. When I am walking leisurely in the park, the local people are enjoying themselves with picnics, Korean songs and dances. Some tourists do take photos with MacArthur’s statue, of course with relaxation and out of admiration."
Nothing Exceptional,"This memorial to the landing of the UN forces at Inchon at a pivotal point in the Korean War is fairly new and is tucked away at the top of a hill a good distance from the waterline. Since it's built on a pretty steep slope, it's got a pronounced vertical orientation. Daunting flights of stairs dominate the central axis and lead up through the various levels, but there are much gentler ramps for those who don't feel like undertaking that grueling climb.There's a small plaza in front of the museum where a couple of amphibious tractors and artillery pieces are displayed, along with the flags of the countries involved in the landing.The museum features a short film about the Inchon operations. (One drawback: there are no benches in this room.) There are also several exhibit rooms showing costumes of the UN and Korean forces, weapons, equipment, memorabilia, and so forth. It's not an extensive collection, but it's not bad.There's a snack bar outside in a separate facility. Restrooms are also to be found there, as well as on the bottom floor of the museum. There's also more military hardware outdoors over that way, including a jet fighter, and then down the trail there are some benches under the trees where the locals like to hang out to enjoy the relative quietThe topmost level, behind the museum proper, has a small eternal flame and a statue of MacArthur, if I recollect rightly.It's not the greatest experience, but it's not too shabby either."
