Good experience but pricey,"Lots of stalls offering the same seafood. We bought about 2kg King Crab and a 2kg Lobster + a few freebies (few prawns and oysters) that costed about krw170k which I don’t think is cheap compared to where I came from where seafood is imported. However, these are fresh and therefore delicious.Do note though, the price of cooking these at the 2nd floor is not cheap either. It costs me about krw100k. Cooking goes by a fix krw4k/pax cover charge and krw8k/kg cooking charge and additional charge for rice, drinks & etc.To conclude, you can go for the experience if you don’t mind spending. If not, you can spend this money somewhere else."
Varieties of Seafood!,"My Daughter and I walked around the market being wowed by the different varieties of seafood but to avoid the hassle of haggling to buy and paying the preparation fees, we opted to go directly in one of the restaurant upstairs. We choose a restaurant that served a course menu of Korean style sashimi with 14 dishes. I would say, the food was average when it comes to taste but but the squirming chopped live octopus was definitely an amazing and unique experience."
Best place to get seafood in Seoul,"The best place to get seafood in Seoul. The fish stall are linked to the restaurant, so Khuan need to select and they will cook for you. A bit pricey but the king crab is worth the price. A heartfelt meal for the whole family."
Fresh seafood but be careful of the Restaurant Price,The lady that sealling the fresh seafood was very friendly and give us advise on the seafood that we chose. And the price is reasonable too.But be careful of the restaurant you going to choose.they will charge you the price very high..that what happend to us.
Fresh...Fresh Seafood!,"Visited on a weekday morning and it's not crowded. Abundance of stalls selling live seafood. The lady selling us the seafood was extremely friendly but the guy was quite arrogant! She also brought us to a small restaurant on another floor to prepare the seafood for us. The food preparation was fine but the charges just for the cooking was expensive. Overall, not really worth it."
Best whole fish market in Seoul,"All fresh seafood are here . Not too expensive. And you can choose the restaurant for cooking upstairs . The price for cooking is also cheap . Very impressed . Some use English speaking, very easy to communicate"
"Great market, but beware of the restaurant","Went to Noryangjin fish market with my wife to treat ourselves to king crab. Managed to get a good price for 2.8kg crab ($180Aud), however, we were stung by the restaurant preparing our crab. First there was the serving fee ( which almost doubled in price because we didn't have soup), than the steaming fee for the crab (charged per kilo). What started up being a simple day of buying and eating fresh crab, ended being an expensive day at the restaurant, charging us approximately $60aud just to steam and serve our crab with a garnish of 4 pieces of lettuce, 1 chilli and 1 sliced fresh garlic. It's cheaper to go to a restaurant that has king crab and get them to prepare it.Btw, the crab was delicious. Meat was firm and sweet. Much better than buying the frozen crab legs."
Big one!!!,My friends mum said this place made new building.So big..!!! We choose sea foods then go up stairs one of restaurant we can eat these we choose sea foods. but quite expensive here ...Sea foods cost + cooking cost +cover charge etc...We spent 5 of us W 320000 all up.But one day of experience is GOOD!!!
Fresh seafood with different level of pricing,"There were plenty of seafood, it was very interesting we went round and round the market. King Crabs are a common sight.. Fresh Fish if you want it sashimi style. We check the price, it was very costly. They have different layers of pricing like buying the fresh seafood price. They lead you to the Restaurant upstairs, There is a surcharging of per dish fee, tea fee, side dish fee, per head fee before you sit down. In the end, we decide not to have dinner there. But it is a good visit, I get to see new seafood that I never seen before."
The freshest seafood you could possibly find in Seoul,"My daughter and I visited this place because we wanted to get fresh seafood, and true enough this was the perfect place. There are fresh seafood vendors inside and outside and we opted to just eat fresh sushi but there are fresh seafood inside where you can purchase and take to the restaurants upstairs and they will cook it however way you would like it cooked. It was a great experience anyway and we wanted to visit the place as well. For a seafood wholesaleMarket , it was pretty clean and organized and not chaotic. It was easy to catch a cab in the other street after we ate. The place closes early in the afternoon so make sure you go there early in the morning or late morning . "
Costly seafood,Heard from friend to give it a try. Ordered crab and 2 large prawns and cost 73000 won with cooking fee. Seafood tastes very fresh. 
Pricy but the experience is worth it!,"We went there after all what we heard and read about that place! We really enjoyed the evening! The food is super fresh and tasty. Picking such fresh fish isn't something you can do in many places around the world! Yes, it was pricy and yes they charge foreigners more and yes you have to negotiate the price but isn't this part of the fun "
"Visit, take lots of pictures, don' t buy","A clean large fish market with a huge variety of fish and seafood. When you just buy as a final customer, it is really expensive. Busan is better in that respect."
Lunch at the fish market is pricy,"As many of you have probably read in other reviews you buy seafood from one of the vendors on the main floor. Then you're brought up to the 2nd floor where they take you to a restaurant where they cook the food for you. I bought a king crab (price is by weight) and an order of prawns which came 5 in an order. That cost me KRW 60,000 which is about $50. I thought that would be it but when I went to pay the restaurant charged ME another approximately KRW 30,000 as a service fee for cooking the food. All in with a beer cost me about USD $90 or fractional more. The food was fresh and good but I wasn't prepared to spend that much. Oh well you live and learn. "
Must visit,Come here and view an auction or just walk around looking at the different selection. There are a couple of restaurants on the 2nd floor that will cook you any of the fish you buy. Food was fantastic and the experience was well worth the time
Overpriced,"This is the first time I’ve brought my parents along, and this isn’t my first time here, was pretty excited as my parents love to have seafood. We had fun selecting our seafood with reasonable price but the nightmare started when we finished our dinner and was going to pay our bills. Couldn’t believe my own eyes how much it costed us. We had 4 seafood, 3 out of 4 dishes was steam, we only had our crabs stir fried, yet the bill was exorbitant. Our seafood costed 56000won with a fish, 4 abalone, 2 crabs and 8 prawns. The bill for dinning in the restaurant was 71000won. "
Highlight to Our Trip to Seoul,This isn't a place to save money. It is an experience that is so memorible and delectable it has to enjoyed. My 3 children and niece were mesmerized by all the edible sea creatures for over an hour. When we finally chose our dishes they were prepared upstairs... sushi downstairs (where my hawk of a mother-in-law made sure we got the freshest selection) My five year old had sea cucumber and enjoyed it. I will remember that taste for a long time.
Fascinating ,"Was there towards the end of the day with colleagues. The market was still rather active, more sellers than buyers at that time of the day. Assortments, types of live seafoods were incredible.We bought several types of fish, abalone, prawn and brought them to the restaurants upstairs. It was packed, very crowded. Nonetheless, the fish prepared in sashimi style, except abalone and prawn, which were steamed, were served in no time. Very fresh and so tasty.Highly recommended for seafood lovers."
Lots of seafood,"We spent about $400 worth of seafood. Great price, but when added the cooking fees, it was not really a good deal at all. However, seafood tasted fresh and really good.. Recommended to visit and maybe spend less $. Must bargain all the times."
carefull,Can vist but advice not buy to cook in the above restaurant.Too expensive.Be Carefull the charger of restaurant charger.Even We asked bf bring It to restaurant.
Interesting offerings,"Though not a ""fish person,"" I truly enjoyed visiting this market which offers numerous varieties of seafood not readily found in the US. There were huge shrimp/prawns/scallops, even larger crabs and lobsters, and vendors nimbly climbing on the tanks to retrieve product. We did not elect to eat at the market, but if one didn't want to ""chance"" a cooked-to-order overcharge, they could opt for a wide variety of offerings from the restaurants on the second floor."
To Experience it.,"This place is in my itinerary for Seoul trip. Just wanted to experience the fish market in Korea. We took public transportation to get there and venture into the market. The 1st floor (ground floor) is dedicated for seafood heaven. All sort of fresh seafood selling here. Know how to bargain, know which seller will give you their best price. Usually people will buy the seafood here and will go upstairs to the restaurant for them to cook it. Well,we did not do that as we rather cook it ourselves at the place we were staying. So, in our bags we have prawns, scallops, cockerels, fishes, squids. Upstairs, on the 2nd floor you have the restaurants, more seafood vendors, meat section and dried section. We even bought some anchovies and dried shrimps. All set with heavy bag, we head on to the subway, heading back to our place. Overall, it was pretty interesting to experience the market, interesting vendors, friendly and we really enjoyed it. Beside the seafood are indeed fresh. "
Avoid !!!!,"We were charged abt 250000 won for cooking service whereas our seafood is around 320000 won.. the cooking service was overcharged… Will never go again n will not recommend too… In total , one meal we spend Singapore dollars 600 plus.. for one king crab, 6 scallops, 6 abalone, half steam fish, a piece of bbq salmon, 2 octopus fried with vegetable, one dish of vegetables, one fried rice, 4 pcs of sea urchin, small plate of shading octopus, one plate of fried prawns . 6 adults one kid …"
Biggest Fish Market in Seoul (i guess),"the place is well maintained although the elevator has a stinky, fishy smell when we went there. Lots of fresh seafoods inside the aquariums for you to choose.just let the ""on-site Cooks"" know ahead of time to not overcook your seafood 'coz they have a tendency to do this.If you're looking for the live raw octupus to eat, this place has it. they sell baby octupus that even when chopped alive, the poor creature still moves and has the suctioning parts"
Overpriced,Cooking fee is expensive and 1 seat costs 6000 won each. Insane.Seafood is alright but the fee is unreasonable. The sellers always push us to buy their seafood and some of them have bad attitudes.
Fascinating place ,I visited this place after watching multiple YouTube videos about it with my husband. This was a fascinating place to visit lots of weird and wonderful fish that you won’t find anywhere else in the world in a fish market. I recommend stopping if you are visiting Korea it’s one of those once in a lifetime experiences that you won’t get back home if you are From a very western country The only complaint we had was trying to get a taxi out as none of the drivers speak English and they refuse to take you anywhere if they can’t understand you. Taxi rank is hard to find due to construction 
Seafood Trip.....Regretted!,"Overrated and not worth at all. The seller keep pushing for you to buy from them. Once bought, the restaurant upstairs not bothered to entertain you as I am going with my family , total 4 persons. Finally got a place, after 3 restaurants rejected us as they are expecting more crowds/ table during meal hours. Then the seat and the cooking fee they charge is more expensive than the seafood we bought! Never again will I go to Noryanjin Market, ever."
Sitting charged and cooking fees,"The minutes you walked into the fish market. They approach you quickly n very aggressive into buying crab, fish, clam, octopus and etc. We paid $140 for the smaller crab, halibut and some clams. What pissed me off is upstairs restaurant over charged us for sitting and cooking fees included the soup $130.00. Not very honest peoples and wrong way of doing business. Never again.. "
Stay Away!! ,"Hmmm...family comes here w high hopes of having fresh fish. The place is absolutely not tourist friendly. If you don’t speak korean then you’re out of luck. Instead you get duped into the hands of a racketeer. A lady and this man on the corner beg us to buy fish. The man says that this lady owns a restaurant. Have no idea whether having a connection to a restaurant owner is a must to eat there because I don’t speak Korean. So I give into this ploy, buy the fish (30,000 won for a flavorless flat fish slippery-tasting fish that he kept pushing on us, along with a meager portion of salmon and tuna thrown which we had requested) and off we go into this restaurant that the lady leads us to. The idea is that they would bring the fish to us filleted. We get side dishes (lettuce leaves and darn-jahng) brought to us and we buy some battered shrimp and fish there. When we get done we are waved down saying we owe money. What? We paid for the fish and the tempura. What would we owe? They charged us for not having ordered the soup—try 5,000 won per person so 20,000 won. It’s ridiculous. Oh and if the story can’t get any worse, my husband gets sick from the food. Yep, upchuck on our trip to Korea. They should take the license away from these swindlers and make them slough dead skin off of people. Stay away. Trust me. It’s not worth it."
Tricky transaction,"Its a fish market so I am not sure if the management can actually improve it since there are so many vendors. To begin My tolerance level is quite high and i understand its a business, and business is tough. I get it. But after the experience today this place needs a review so that no one else should have to put up with this. This review is for stall #43 not the whole market itself.Now this is not the first time Ive been to this market. The first time was 2 years ago and the experience was fantastic (Old area). The second and also last time I will ever go again was today.We began doing our rounds asking for alaskan king crab prices since this was our priority item. Vendors were throwing out prices per kg left and right. All ranging from 70000 won to 80000 won. Okay we thought. First of all. Its market price and that fluctuates or maybe its not the right season etc. Whatever we just wanted some good crab. Eventually we came to a stall with 2 older ladies that spoke mandarin and gave a price at 65000 per kg. Sold. The lowest price so far and we were getting tired of browsing. First mistake.We ended up buying a whole alaskan king crab weighing 2.4kg at 156k won. They quickly grabbed one from the middle tank, weighed it and shoved it into a plastic bag. Second mistake.After we paid. A guy appeared and took us upstairs to a restaurant where they cooked it. Eventually the steamed crab and abalone arrives to our table, it was already cut since it was an option. Too messy to do it myself. Upon grabbing the largest leg. I realized something was off. Little to no meat, mushy and was sticking to the shell. I inspected all the other legs and found it to be all in same poor quality. Final thought the crab was not fresh. This was either a dead crab that was swapped during cooking or pre frozen. It cant be the same crab we bought 20 minutes ago. Then we realized we did not inspect the crab before they bagged it. Upon even further inspection we found one of the legs was also missing. This was the tipping point for us. We went back to the stall afterwards and feedback to the 2 ladies. Their reply was oh. The restaurant must of overcooked it. Overcooked? This is a drastic difference in meat quality. It was literally mush. We also mentioned that it was missing a leg. ""Oh yeah the one you bought is incomplete. Thats why its so cheap at 65k. The complete ones are 90k won"" ...now you tell us this after we made the purchase. This type of business handling is street vendors looking to scam tourists. And I must admit. I was at the bad end today.So there are my 2 cents for this visit. I know there are honest vendors in the market. But after the experience today it just tainted what good it had going for it. Its a shame really."
Definitely Overcharged,"It is a big building with live and dead seafood. There are hundreds of stalls selling either shell fish or all sorts of fishes. We went on a Monday late morning and we only see a few Koreans in this market. I guess most Koreans do not come to this market for seafood.We got some prawns, scallops, fish, cockles and octopus and a lady brought us upstairs to a restaurant. The seafood costs about KRW 80,000. The food are either bbq or steamed. I must say that the bbq ones are lousy. The cook basically put the prawns and scallops on a hot plate and waited for the food to be cooked without any oil, butter or any sauces/herbs. They came out dry. As for the cockles, the cook just poured the whole bowl into some hot water to cook the meat. Though the flesh is supple, it becomes dry in a very short while. The fish which is steamed is the best. What many reviewers stated is the same. I was quite shocked that the cooking price came up to KRW80,000, especially for such lousy cooking skills and methods.Overall, good to go and take a look at the live seafood. Buy some if you want, but i would advise to bring back to cook yourself. "
Go if you like such things...,"... not to eat. I enjoy fish markets the world over. I go very early in the day to look around and take pics. This place is impressive, if a bit odd. It’s very close to the subway station. I didn’t bother to buy anything and have it cooked at one of the upstairs restaurants. "
Overcharging for seafood and restaurant fees(specially),"From the past reviews here, I was gamed and prepared to experience the bargaining for such tourist place. But little did I expect the fee at restaurant (door no.17) was more than the seafood purchased at level 1.To summarise, each dish/seafood is chargable 10k to 20k cooking fee, unless u specifically tell the service staff to steam (still chargeable 8k per kg). That is on top of the 5k per person fee.I have experienced the fish market in other cities in korea, but not as expensive as noryangjin fish market. I can say the seafood at level 1 is fresh and that's it. But as tourist we can bring those around without the restaurant.I have sensed the market was oddly quiet environment @ 11am, not a single other tourist sighted except us and fish sellers. Definitely, restaurant #17 at least, although the service staff explained its is the standard rate there and blah blah. As I was travelling with a large family, I didnt argue much. Lesson learnt. Black listed place. First and worst experience in seoul so far."
Pushy sales people following you around,"FYI: This is a working fish market...wear sensible shoes (avoid flip flops, high heels and open toe shoes). I have really mixed reviews about this place. Definitely good to snap a few memorable photos but I don't think the locals like it unless you buy something from their stall. On the other hand, I also probably ate the best king crab I ever had with my spouse and his buddy. Part of the experience was rather uncomfortable. As soon as we walked in, there were people who started following us, speaking in Mandarin and pressuring to buy the seafood and take upstairs to cook on the second floor. Probably close to no one there speaks a word of English. I would also recommend to pay premium and buy something that is alive and swimming, not something that has been sitting on display on a bed of ice as we learned the hard way. The skewer of scallops that was on display on ice ended up hard and chewy. The live king crab (close to $100 USD) was worth the price even though when you take it upstairs, they charge a cooking fee (we took it to Dragon Palace #17 where lots of people were eating...clearly a good sign)."
Go there with a korean,"Its a cool place to see, but I wouldnt personally go there again without someone that knows korean. When there, do not only check out the new fish market tho. Also give some time to the old one, which whilst is not as fancy. Its pretty interesting to see, and was for me more fun than the indoors market."
Great Market Tour and Fresh Seafood Meal,"We always make it a point to visit local markets during our tours to see the kind of fresh food they have. This is more like a huge seafood distribution centre which also does retail sales. Despite coming with empty stomachs, we almost couldn't finish all our food. Were too ambitious and bought too much food. Had a king crab, some prawns, abalones, scallops, and huge plate of mixed sashimi for four of us. The steamed king crab was the highlight! Really juicy and full of meat! The abalones were lightly BBQed and it was tender and juicy too! The sashimi was really fresh and we had never eaten so much sashimi at one seating! TIP1: choose those king crab with one leg less ... they charge less per kg for the imperfect crabTIP2: watch out for those ""freebies""... ours (the prawns and scallops) turn out to be not really fresh ..."
WARNING - RUINED SEAFOOD,"We visited the markets post reading some positive reviews and some not so positive, as well as numerous travel blogs recommending this as a must when coming to South Korea. Well, those that rated it highly must be rating only based on the novelty of the experience or have no culinary experience, a lack of taste buds, low expectations, or a mix of it all. The first part - the seafood market - delivers as expected. Lots and lots of sea creatures to buy either alive or already dead. Including some already ready to eat as sashimi. It may not be to everyone’s liking though, seeing all these fishes and crustaceans crammed in small containers...so be prepared. A lot of venders, all pretty much selling the same stuff. So shop around for what looks best if you want, and don’t forget to barter if you can be bothered which is almost an expectation (note that most places don’t show prices for that reason). It helps to buy all you need from one vendor to get a better price overall.We stopped at one vendor, who actually spoke reasonable English, and bought large prawns, octopus, king crab, scallops and he threw in some free oysters and clams - however I have to say that we got well overcharged for what we chose (yep, we didn’t really bother bartering), so the free stuff feels a lot more like a sympathy gift, or a bonus for all the money we gave him 195,000 KRW ($240 AUD).(Note: You will have to pay for your food to get cooked, and you pay per item - so stuff they throw in for free, will be charged to be cooked...)After we paid for our sea bounty, the vendor handed us over to a younger guy whom we followed to a restaurant on the second floor. The restaurant looked clean, had two small groups of people, and didn’t really smell like any cooking had happened. But we sat any ways. The option was only 2 cooking methods, steam or BBQ. The lady serving us took the prawns to BBQ and the rest to steam. We went along with it thinking let’s trust in the seafood chef. What we got was so disappointing, considering the amazing seafood we had over paid for.None of the food came with any sort of soup, broth, herbs, spices, anything what so ever. The steamed oysters had no flavour (lucky they were ‘free’). We wanted them just raw or grilled at most. Maybe some ginger or garlic, something!The crab was nice but bland and dry, again not cooked in any special way - just steamed.The prawns had been cooked on the bbq for way too long - they came so dry and chewy (not cooked with any butter or any sort of sauce). The octopus first came out sashimi - which was a fun first time experience. After a few mouthfuls of moving tentacles, we asked if they could grill the rest of it, but again they came back steamed. We had a few more mouthfuls and left the rest due to lack of flavour - at one point the waitress came over and took the octopus plate away, and returned it having been steamed a second time (you have to laugh at the madness).So...after having selected what we thought was going to be an amazing seafood bounty, paying through the nose for it, we were left completely gutted that they had ruined it all by simply steaming every bit of it, over bbq’ing the prawns, no sauce, no broth/soup, no flavours, not even a garnish. And all of that for 52,000 KRW ($64 AUD)!We left with a lack of delicious flavours playing in our mouths (I was seriously expecting something delicious like I’ve gotten all over Seoul so far on this one month trip), a big hole in pockets, and a very poor view of this ‘highly rated’ must do when in Seoul experience.Go buy the seafood, barter barter barter (or get a Korean to go with you - maybe even buy them a gift it will still save you money), and take it home to cook yourself, if you need use some YouTube videos or other online cooking guide, I don’t think you could go any more wrong than what we got served today!"
Great experience for photo taking but not food,"plenty of seafood to sea in a market, but wasn't really please with the restaurant. Note that the purchase price of seafood and to cook it is a separate cost altogether. Nothing fantastic about the style of cooking so its probably just worth going there for the experience"
Fun to shop around and then eat what you buy,"You really shouldn't fault the hawkers for doing their job - hawk all that fresh seafood! And the fun is in the banter in broken korean and english with them and if you are keen to eat the freshest and most diverse, then you should try it out. And there will always be a another keen restauranter who would be keen to help you cook and prepare what you have bought. For us, it was fun, and plentiful of good tasty pescetarian delights!"
Yummy seafood Good eats Worth the Stop,"Honestly, it's a great place to eat fresh seafood and have it prepared at one of the many restaurants that are located behind the market ans delivered right to your table.Pros: 1. Friendly merchants who attempt to square dab2. Fresh sashimi from a fish that was just swimming in a tank as opposed to those ""frozen"" places that I have to wait to eat so it thaws out before you can even it.3. Fresh oysters cut on the 1/2 shell that melt in your mouth.4. Yummy steamed shrimp served up and ready to peel/eat. 5. Very affordable for a family of 4 if you stick with the basics...All of the above go down well with beer or soju! Enjoy.Cons:1. Be ready for the smell of the fish market and wear your shoes that you don't care about just in case they get wet and smell like seafood for the rest of your trip.2. Sometimes, it takes time to get your fish cooked soup brought to your table."
Definitely a NO to Noryangjin Market,"The sea products varieties are there. But the hawker are pushing you to buy the king crap or other prized product. Once you bought and you go to 2nd floor to the restaurant, the same attitude is reflecting. They will look at what you have purchased. If you buy too little seafood, they will chase you away or ignore you. Personally for my experience, I have bought abalone, shells, squids and salmon fish and after bargain, only we can eat in one of the restaurant. And the charges of the cooking services(plus the seating place) is much more expensive than the sea product that i bought. Never again will I be back."
Not worth going,"The fish market is quite big and easy to go by train but we think can skip this place. We have a bad experience and impression of Korea on the second day of our trip. A lot variety of fresh seafood. The price of fresh seafood is ok but of course have to bargain but this is just the beginning. The worker/owner of the seafood stall will keep following and ask us to go to their restaurant. They don't cook seafood the way you want even we told them to. The cooking fees shown on board of the shop - KRW3,000 per person without soup and KRW5,000 per person with soup. Be cautious, they still overcharged us. The amount of seafood we bought is KRW65,000 but the cooking fees we paid is KRW79,000 whereby no soup and just steam all our seafood. How come they steam our oysters. We want to eat it fresh. We also noticed they only serve soup to Korea citizen and no soup to tourist. When we ask how they got the amount charged for cooking fees, they don't even bother to answer us. This really caused a bad impression for Korea tourism. Hope no one will be the next victims like us. Don't visit the restaurant No. 4."
Boring market,It's just another fish market and nothing special about it. Some stall sellers will approach you but I think they are mostly China Chinese. I doubt the price will be good. I think you can spend half an hour there just to get a feel of the place.
Noryangjin Fish Market,"Her türden deniz canlısının bulunabileceği ilginç bir deniz ürünleri pazarı. Fiyatlar ortalamanın üstünde, fakat görülmesi gerekli bir mekan.Interesting market with any kind of sea product. It is possible only to buy, also it is possible to have them cooked immediately there. However, prices are not so cheap!"
Underwhelmed with the new fish market,"The old and the new fish market are right next to each other. Initially we walked through the old one first from the subway to get to the new one. I had learnt that some vendors decided to not move to the new building, so the new fish market was quite awkwardly empty in such a huge space."
Good seafood,"Nice place to visit if you want to see all possible things that live in the world ocean.You can buy directly from the market and go at the 5th floor of the next building and prepare it. Recommend, nice experiwnce"
Interesting Tour of Noryangjin Markets,"Enjoyed seeing all the different types of seafood available at both the old and new fish markets. Our guide and host Taein knew his way around the markets. He selected very fresh fish and octopus, which was cut into sashimi and sushi and also a fish stew.Delicious! I recommend this air bnb experience to get the most out of your market tour."
"Average seafood, very touristy and pushy in sales.","The seafood in this place is not of the best quality. Stall owners there learn Chinese to sell to mainland tourists. Extremely pushy in sales, will follow you all the day and hold you to bring you to their restaurants. It's unique that they cook seafood for you in the way you prefer after purchasing it fresh. The live octopus is also unique to Noryangjin / Korea (haven't actually tried this anywhere else!) "
It’s worth the experience!,"We reached Noryangjin Fish Market via subway, stopped at Noryangjin station, walked out at exit 7. About 50m, enter the tunnel on your right and there are signs leading the way to the market. It took us couple of minutes. First stall we approached was stall number 28. Quote for King crab was 39,000 won per kg. It’s much cheaper than what we read on tripadvisors so we didn’t explore other stalls. We bought a 2.5kg King crab, 3 abalones for 10,000won and 5 big size prawns for 10,000won for 3 of us. Happy with our purchase we were led upstairs to the restaurant to prepare our food. We had the King crab steamed, prawns and abalones grilled. King crab meat was so fresh, tender and sweet. Food preparation came to 45,000won, not cheap. Unless you are willing to go from restaurant to restaurant to compare the food preparation, I would suggest just factor in the preparation price into the seafood price. 165,000 won was really worth it especially for such a huge King Crab."
Fresh seafood with a reasonable price!,"Very cheap seafood. You can find variety of fish, squids, lobsters, etc. for a very reasonable price. For me it's very cheap compared to Japan. After select the seafood you want, you can go upstairs and bring them to the restaurant. There would be a cooking service available but quite expensive (but worth it anyway)"
Rip off ,"Never ever left a negative feedback on TripAdvisor but I have to share my experience at the Noryangjin fish marketWe did ask the cooking price in detail before picking this restaurant as one of the restaurant speaks mandarin. We were told 3000 won “sitting” fee for head and 8000 won for cooking king Crab if weight more than one kg. However, we end up being charged 20000 won for each stir fry, 7000 won per kg for king crab and 8000! won each for grilled prawn, 5000 won sitting fee. When we questioned the charging, another staff (who also speaks mandarin) said all the charges are correct and apparently there are 2 types of “sitting” fees.If ordering meals at the fish market, please be cautious. Make sure you have checked the cooking fees per dish beforehand and have the fees written down so there will be no disagreement later. "
Not worth the trip ,"This so called traditional fish market, apparently due to its popularity and inflow of tourists, is not so ""traditional"" anymore. Though open for 24 hours, we went there during night time, most of the stalls closed and limited seafood available, most of the stalls selling the same range of seafood. I would rather go to a better restaurant with the same price. "
"Local, authentic fish market","I headed here on the Metro system early one Friday afternoon recently and more or less followed my nose out of the station, through an underpass and came out between the two buildings that make up the bulk of this extensive fish market. I first wandered over to the old building. There were still many stallholders selling their wares but around 2 o'clock in the afternoon there were few buyers. It's safe to say that you should be able to buy any type of marine life you fancy eating here. I wasn't buying and I was rarely stopped for any hard sell.Later, I walked over to the much newer building where, again there seemed to every thinkable type of marine life available for purchase. Again there were more than enough stalls but few customers. I took the escalator up to the first floor where there was very much the same extensive selection, including loads of dry fish and stalls where you could buy sauces, pastes etc. Lining this floor were many small, rustic type restaurants where I'm sure fresh sea food is a guarantee. I headed deep into the interior of this floor and found an edo sushi restaurant which I simply couldn't resist. This is certainly the place to come if you are curious about seeing a traditional market with the complete focus on the sea and everything that swims, crawls or simply exists in it."
Just nice,"Went here by taxi from Myeongdong hotel, it took like 15 mins no traffic 6:30 am. Pros: just nice to see the difference between the seafood here and other places. Stingray seems popular. We came early so the restaurants are closed and we never bothered to make sure bec it’s early to have a hearty fish meal. cons: It’s not a small place. It’s pretty big. Can be exhausting for seniors.Price can be expensive so choose what’s exotic for you. "
A fascinating and very hectic place,"The fish market is a fascinating place to visit - probably not the sort of thing high on people's list of ""things to do"", but it is well worth a visit. There is a wet and dry fish market. The former is full of fascinating fish and shellfish (etc!). You can purchase some fish and have it prepared by one of the restaurants around the market."
Authentic and delicious - a must!,"If you like fresh sea food and enjoy authentic experience, then this is the place for you! We loved every minutes of it and the food and service, despite the language barrier, was exceptional."
Incredible experience !,To see maximum activity you would have to come very early.The place is really huge and the diversity of sea food species is impressive. What a photo safari!My only regret is not having dared a plate of raw fish at 7 am.
Wet fish market,"Visited this market very early in the morning, and could view all the different types of fishes on display."
Fresh fresh fresh seafood,"We went to the wrong direction as we came out from exit 1.The best exit is exit 7. Then u walk 5mins u will see IVY BUILDING on the left (opp the road). Then u see a slope going down to the tunnel - BINGO there u can see a BLUE sign NORYANGJIN MARKET.We went there ard 7.30pm and lots of stalls r open.... We nego 3-4 stalls then we finally settle on one. After/before u pay the seafood, some guys will come and bring you to the restaurant. Dont worry they will let u know the cooking price before u decide ...If u r a die hard seafood fan... Must visit here..Cheap n fresh"
Just as good as the first time!,This was our second visit and we can without doubt say this is one of our favorite fish markets in the world. It’s not huge and you don’t need a guide. Some markets people don’t want you to take pictures of their items but vendors here are very friendly -just asks first. They will even hold up items and pose for your photos. The best part about this place is buying the extremely fresh seafood and heading straight to one of the adjacent restaurants ( if you’re not sure where to go the vendors will hook you up with someone who will walk you there. Don’t worry. It’s not a trap). At the restaurant enjoy your purchases along side a bunch of soju like a local. 
Fish Market Tour,"Highly recommended tour of the “old” AND “new” fish market. Our guide “T” took us on a tour of the fish market and some of the history behind the district. He was VERY personalable and informative. “T” was able to talk and negotiate for the fresh seafood and most important, have them prepare it how you like (traditional) way. If you like seafood, this is a MUST DO when in Seoul!!! Unlike myself, I didn’t read the whole description of what we would expect would be included when booking... included are:- tour of old and new fish market- options of seafood your group may like to try (additional cost if you want something like lobster or in our case, some abalone and scallops). - choices of preparations of food you chose- ENJOY the food that was alive just minutes ago.Our group had a blast!!! And we are hoping that this tour will gain more popularity with those traveling to Korea (Seoul Hunters)."
"Tai, jyeon ah, baby octopus, meyeon tang ","Red tai skin on and off, abalone, cut-live baby octopus, and soup made by the tai head/bones were the dishes we ate! Always fresh and delicious. Barely $100 us + $40 for prep at the restaurant (including beers/soju) and meeting tang soup enough for 4 people+.We always come here when we visit seoul."
What you buy is what you get!,"Peruse the many fish stalls here, choose your fish (barter a bit on the price, if you are brave enough!) and then sit down have a beer whilst it is cooked fresh for you. Every fish eaters dream! "
New Exp for seafood...,"I swear to god, If u are seafood lover, this place is the paradise. U can enjoy all sea living animals but the prices are quite expensive. Be aware of not wearing slippers or flip-flop there because of fishy and wet floor, better with boots. U can't ask so many questions due to difficult communication. Bargain is acceptable but not for too much. It's better to go there only if u dare to choose alive sea livings to eat otherwise it's very difficult to make decision to choose. Ahh! I almost forget to review that restaurants in old fish market are poor in hygienic..."
Many types of fish,In this market you will be crazy by seeing thousands of fish and other sea animals for sellLike the way they display And prices are so cheap
Seafood...More Seafood,"This is a fun experience for the family especially for kids. My kids said this is a better experience than the aquarium, because you can see them, touch them and eat them later...LOL.We went there during summer, so not all the vendors were opened, but there are enough vendors for you to choose from. They have so many kind of seafood, you buy them, and they will cook them upstairs for you. The king crab is a must! So much cheaper than getting from a restaurant. If you re brave enough, try the live octopus, it's a little chewy but very tasty! You do have to neogiate the price to get a good deal, make sure you visit a few more vendors before settle on one. Overall I'll definitely go back again."
Fish market fun,"This place is a must do in Seoul if you like fish. No Korean required. Here’s how it works. Walk in. Walk around. See what looks good. Don’t stop at the first place that speaks English. Once you settle on something, start talking. It’s all right to point, then gawk, then walk away if you want. If you pick a live fish, they will kill it there. If you want it sashimi style, they will cut it up. Pay for the fish. Then, go with a man who appears from nowhere and takes you upstairs. Don’t ask questions. He will drop you in a restaurant. Tell them how you want the fish cooked. Sit down. Drink. Cooked fish will appear. Eat. Drink some more. Pay as you leave. Thank me later."
Very interesting! Tourist-friendly place!,There are two separated parts in the Noryangjin Fish Market: the old marked and the new marked. The first one looks like the old traditional market while the second one is a very new and modern market where the tourist can roam around and discover different types of fishes and seafood. The best thing is that you can buy your own fresh seafood and fish at the ground floor and then carry them to the first floor where there are lot of restaurants that cook them for you in a very reasonable price.
An amazing gastronomic experience ,"We had a great first time experience at the new wing of the fish market. (Go at dinner time! The restaurants are open until past 10pm.) Probably because we took our time to shop around and suss out the ""market rate"", at no point did we feel ripped off, unlike some of the reviews. Arrived at 6pm via subway. After asking about 10 vendors, we found a more honest seller (stall 13 near south gate no. 2). She quoted significantly lower prices than the rest, but did not entertain much further haggling. We bought crabs, sea urchins, prawns and octopuses from this lady, and a huge platter of sashimi from the stall next door.A boy guided us to an affiliated restaurant called Hyun Dae. There, the Mandarin speaking lady boss came out and asked us how we'd like each item to be cooked. The cooking fee for each style was clearly stated on the wall, in Korean, so we felt reassured. The seafood came out beautifully steamed, grilled and boiled. The restaurant was full of local diners, including couples on dates, and office workers having after-hours drinks. So it did not feel like a tourist trap. The star dish was something we didn't quite buy from the market stall: my friend copied what she saw on a travel show, and got the restaurant to take the empty crab shells with some roe/cream left inside, and make fried rice with them. (Pictured) Best. Fried. Rice. Ever. I think this is a dish any restaurant at the fishmarket can whip up. So do try it. The restaurant bill, which included cooking fees, booze and side dishes for 3 persons, came up to 67k won. Overall, we had an amazing dinner, and would totally do it again if we ever return to Seoul.Directions: To get there from the station, do not take the overhead bridge across the train tracks, as Google will recommend. Though it works, that route will bring you through a dodgy and foul smelling car park. Instead, go via the underground tunnel. It's newish, brightly lit and smelled fine (for a fish market)."
Nothing like it,Fascinating exposure to a wholesale market of the delicacies of the sea. Wonderful opportunity to see foods you've likely never seen before!
Interesting place. One time visit only,"I went on a culinary adventure to Noryangjin as some of them wanted to try eating live octopus. The place was easy to find and the market is certainly an interesting place to visit. It’s amazing how much seafood is harvested and eaten by humans :) I feel like we were ripped off though. We purchased a piece of tuna from the fish display and took it to one of the restaurants on the 2nd floor. Many of us think that they might have swapped our tuna for a different piece while it was being cooked. The piece we purchased was very non uniform and the one we received looked just like a well cut piece. This concern aside, the food was ok (not amazing) and the experience won’t be the same in a 2nd visit. IMHO a place for a single visit. Be careful with people and watch your fish as it may be swapped on you too."
It is just okay,"we visited this market (old&new) around noon, and it was empty, a few customers. We did not buy anything from the market, but had lunch at a sushi restaurant on the second floor in the new market. Food was good and price was reasonable.Fish market was okay...no action and kind of boring..sorry..."
Noryangjin Fish Market South Korea,"I love coming here for the fresh Seafood especially the King Crab... One can just choose whatever seafood you and have it cooked in whatever style you liked... However, as it is so fresh, steaming is the best..."
Interesting,"I have mixed feelings here. It was a nice place to visit, but it was empty when we visited 12 pm on Wednesday. It was eerie almost. We did buy 3-4 lb fish, but spent $35-$40. Then spent another $30-40 cooking it. So, I spent more than I wanted to. But it was fresh and delicious. I visited Old and New market.. but didn't have a preference of one or the other. "
No trip to Seoul is complete without visiting the fish market,"There is an old building and a new building next to each other. We first walked round the old building which is just one level and saw all kinds of seafood products, many of them still alive. Afterwards we entered the new 3 storey building and saw more of the same. The market sells about 150 tons of seafood a day. You van purchase the seafood from the vendors and take it upstairs to the restaurants who will cook it the way you want and add side dishes (for a price). There is also an area where they sell dried marine products but the whole fish market was one of the highlights in Seoul."
A BIG place,"I was there at roughly 11pm, when no business activity was going on, just the preparation for the early morning hours, so I was just strolling around. Anyway, I had a good time just looking at the quiet stands and people getting ready for a big action hours later. Could imagine that in such a large place the wholesale is a big affair."
Very cool to see!,I’ve been to many fish markets around the world and I found this one very interesting and photogenic because of its gloomy atmosphere in old building. The saleswomen were nice and not many tourists around. Loved it!
Fun and exciting experience,"Fun and adventurous experience. There is an old and new side of the market. I personally prefer the old side, which you will access directly if you came from the train station. It’s definitely wet and dirty but you enjoy such an unique experience! Honestly most of the stores sell similar items, and I kind of got overwhelmed from them trying to sell their seafood. Some were extra friendly and allowed us to take pictures with their lobsters and even octopus! My favorite part was trying raw octopus (10k won for 4 small ones). I would definitely try it again. Being a little squirmish, I started with small tentacles and kept chewing on it. I didn’t experience getting sucked by the tentacles thankfully. The freshness and delicious flavor is a huge draw for me! The drawbacks of the market was that the prices were a little high - 190k won for tiger striped fish sashimi and 170k won for crab. The ladies brought us to the restaurant behind (quite old looking and abit shabby). We were charged 100k won for the cooking and other dishes (ban chan, rice) for 9 adults and 2 Children. The tiger striped fish was served as sashimi and the bones were boiled as spicy or non spicy soup. The crab was boiled and tasted very sweet. The fat from the shell was then used to fry rice with seaweed for about 3 portions - tasted very good too. I don’t know if you can haggle much but it is definitely worth it to check out a few stores before deciding which to go to. One of my favorite experiences in my trip to Seoul/Jeju!"
Thing get pricy after cook,"Bought a king crab and abalone with some freebies (prawn, scallop, optopus..etc). Was lead to a restaurant upstair to cook our stuff. Was told that restaurant will charge 3k won (restaurant asked for 5k during billing, and we told them we was told 3k before we came up)per pax for cook services, but in actual there some hidden cost associated with each dishes. The 3k is only cover the king crab, cooking scallop and the rest all need extra k. End up the cook services we paid for is equal to the stuff we bought. (Mean total cost became double). We got our stuff at the new market which is just next to the old one. Don’t be hurry to get your stuff, walk and ask around. Ask each item’s cook service. As for the taste, seriously just so so only the way they cook it. (Usually either steam or baked)"
Fresh seafood,Has our lunch here. The seafood is nice and sweet with simply cooking. Order king crab and use go fried rice is awesome. Remember to bargain the price 
Fresh Seafood,"Always wanted to visit this fish market for seafood so i ask my Korean guide to bring me there. As i was with my Korean guide, ask her to help shop for seafood. Ended up with a large whole lobster, 1 kg of scallops and another kg of tiger prawns and the stallholder threw in a 2 or 3 fresh abalone. Didn't think the prices were cheap but i just had a craving for seafood.A restaurant staff member is usually nearby and would handle the fresh seafood and lead us up to his shop. At the restaurant i was brought to, it was 8000 per pax for steaming and grilling my purchase with the usual free flow of side dishes, rice and water. Seafood soup and drinks were at an additional cost. The lobster, scallops and abalone were really well prepared and tasty, the prawns so-so. For a total of 6 pax, we spend a total of 210000 won or about USD 30 per person and my stomach was really full. Don't know if it was expansive for Korean standards but from where i come from, it is reasonable price for fresh seafood especially having a huge whole lobster for lunch."
"A little scary, but so glad I went!","So I've got 2-3 hours left in my 12 hour Seoul layover before I have to catch the AREX back to the airport in time for my flight. What to do? Shoehorn another palace in there? Maybe Namsan tower? Nah... I'm going to the fish market because I want to try live octopus!It took a little longer than I planned to get there, and by now I'm starting to chicken out. Maybe I'll just take pictures, I start to think...But sellers are pretty aggressive... and one thing leads to another, so pretty soon I'm bargaining for octopus. But still I think it's probably not going to work out, because I don't speak any Korean. But soon, a diner who speaks English comes forward to help me out and tell me how it works. I pay the seller 2000 won for the octopus, take it, wiggling in a plastic bag full of water, to a restaurant around the corner (more like a few tables and plastic chairs with not exactly the most pristine looking kitchen), I pay the kitchen lady 3000 won and watch her chop it up and put a little sauce on it... and soon the octopus emerges -still wiggling but in pieces now -along with some Korean hot sauce and a couple side dishes. The pieces don't want to stay on my chopsticks, so she gives me a fork. It was delicious. I still wasn't too sure I did a wise thing. But then I watched another lady buy a styrofoam crate full of live octopi from the same seller. She picks one up, and lowers it into her mouth, whole! Wiggling tentacles and all. Sauce? We don't need no stinkin' sauce!So I guess it's Ok... I'm thinking I'll find out within 24 hours... or perhaps during my 12 hour flight home. A week has gone by now and I'm fine. The poor octopi... less so. Seek out new experiences.... but carry activated charcoal just in case. Caveat: While I spent a grand total of 5 dollars on my whole experience, I've read reviews of people who've been ripped off. I think I got lucky. The Korean diner who helped me out said that it cost him 3000 won to cover his table. Granted, all I had was octopus for one. A multi-course seafood feast would probably cost more, but I can't imagine it should really cost the exorbitant prices some people are paying. Probably best to go with a local."
Ripoff experience,"We bought the seafood at reasonable prices but the cooking was very expensive. We paid just as much for the cooking as for the seafood. It costs 8,000krw/kg to bbq...and 15,000krw to stir fry. We stir fried some items which was measly onions and carrots...What exactly am I paying almost $20 CAD for as we provided the seafood.Complete ripoff, stay away...you can get much better value at the various markets (Namdaemun market, Dongdaemun, etc..)"
Great Morning Spot,"If you are battling a little time-zone oddity where you are up early in the morning, too early for other things, the Fish Market is the place to be. Open all the time, go watch an auction in the early morning or just walk among the hundreds of stalls and tanks of fish, squid, shellfish and things of all manner of delight. Be sure to check out the older area under the old overpass."
Can't get any fresher fish than that,"Fish, fish, fish and whatever else comes out of the sea! Take your pick at the many stalls and have it prepared into a typical local meal right in there an then. You point, they prepare and serve. A fish dish can't be any more local and fresher than that!"
Can I consider this place as a China fish market?,Prices is very expensive. Nothing fantastic! I definitely will not recommend this as a must come place. 
The biggest fish market in Seoul...,"As a tradition, most of the fish are still alive in this market, you will find a lots of variety of lobsters, crabs and much more. They have a lots of restaurants on the first floor, so you choose you fish and they cooked it for you, great place to eat soups and fresh sushis. "
Return Visit,"Wrote a review in Nov 2016 and I raved about it. I'll take those words back. Given my previous experience, I decided to bring my parents there this time. Lo and behold, the prices have at least tripled due to high exports to China. Stall owners were all ferocious Chinese ladies and when i tried to bargain a little (I'm not even someone good at bargaining), they shouted and told me to get lost. I tried to find some of the ajummas I was acquainted with before but I couldn't find them at all. This place has been invaded by Chinese merchants and prices are exorbitant. Sadly, I cannot recommend this place anymore."
Unique & Fresh,"Fresh seafood to choose from, then choose your cooking style. Consists of the old and new market. I recommend the new market and select your seafood from the second floor (more selections at individual stalls allowing for better pricing). Then to the restaurant to cook. We checked out the restaurants first, found the one we liked and they escorted us to the seafood stall to select. Not cheap but good and fresh and reasonable. "
Tourist ripoff ,"Overpriced especially at the restaurants, charged close to 70k won for cooking 4mini Abalone & steaming 5shellmeat. This is excluding cost of seafood. "
Tourist ripoff ,"Overpriced especially at the restaurants, charged close to 70k won for cooking 4mini Abalone & steaming 5shellmeat. This is excluding cost of seafood. "
"If you want to eat, keep in mind our experience!","If you want to visit and eat in this place keep in mind our experience:1 In this place no one speaks English so misunderstandings will be at any time...2 We bought 16 pieces between shrimps, clams and oysters for W 25,000, after that, they guided us to another place where the fish will be cooked (a not so nice and neglected place) where a woman asked us how to cook the fish (try to imagine how to comunicate with no english.... ), **We never asked about the cost thinking that cooking will be less expensive than buying the fish (our mistake***) finally when whe ask for the account, the woman asks for W27,000 and then we said if the fish were already paid, why the amount? the woman did more than 3 times the sum trying to justify the W27,000 including things like cover for two persons... so please first ask if the amount is by piece or by weight (kilos), Just take care!"
Great Place to visit to experience the Fishery market in Korea,"There's 2 market at this location.the old market is still operation, but not sure when it will be total tear down for construction.the new market is just beside the old market, with air condition and fully covered.there's 2 level of the market and you can have some Restaurant helping you to prepare the seafood that you bought form the market.Nice experience to see so many different kind of fish and seafoods.with live octopus."
"Rip-off, trourist traps","We bought shrimps, abalones, one medium sized crab, clams, a flounder, and a live octopus for W170,000 (3 people). After negotiating, they took down the price to W150,000 (US$150). Took the seafood to a cafeteria type of restaurant upstairs which cooked all of the above + 3 Cass beers for W86,000 (US$80). All the foods were steamed and grilled, but the clams were made into a soup. All these cookings for W86,000??? The next day, we went to fancy supermarkets and found that the abalones at Galleria and Shinsegae were sold at the same price as the seafood market at W40,000/kg. What the point of going there if the price is the same as a fancy supermarket???Oh, the shrimps were not even fresh cos it stinks really bad after cooked!Not worth coming! A tourist-trap, avoid at any cost!!!"
Similar to Addiction Aquatic Development in Taiwan,"Very similar concept with the Addiction Aquatic Development in Taiwan that I visited recently. (I'm sure the latter got the concept from here). There is the old and new wing; I went to the new wing as it is indoors and the weather was just too cold for me. Upon entering, there are many stalls selling similar seafood at similar prices e.g. krw80000 per kg of King Crab, abalone at krw10000/pc, krw10000/2pcs, krw10000/4pcs, depending on the size. Most sales are based on weight so it might be a good idea to ask for the item to be weighed before committing. As most stalls are selling at similar prices, you might want to take a walk and soak in the oceanic atmosphere before buying from the lucky stall. Also, many of the sellers speak Mandarin so bargaining was easy. Other than giving a discount, the sellers might also throw in a few free shrimps or clams to sweeten the deal. After buying, the seller would send you up to their preferred / recommended restaurant on the 2nd floor to prepare your meal. There are generally 2 types of sitting in the restaurants; either the chair or the floor. You don't get to choose the restaurant so I ended up sitting on the floor for my meal, which was pretty uncomfortable. However, the prices are again standardize throughout the restaurants, i.e. krw5000/cover, krw7000/kg for steaming, so you don't have to worry about being overcharged."
"Fresh seafood, reasonable prices","Big fish market, most of them are selling similar produce so walk around before deciding. Most of the stalls are working with restaurants so you can get your food cooked fresh. We bought a lot of seafood and the prices were reasonable. If you're nice enough, the sellers might even throw in some 'service' E.g 4 small Abalone was W10,000 (she gave us two extra pieces). Must visit if you love seafood!"
Fresh seafood to fill your gastronomy,I love this market very much. you can buy fresh seafood (especially if you want to taste fresh king crab and sashimi) and asked the nearby restaurant to cook for you on the spot and I believe everybody can image how yummy these fresh foods would taste. 
Fresh seafood ,"The seafood is fresh but the price is not really cheap! We tried king crab, scallops and abalone at krw57000 and the charges for cook is abt krw40000. "
Ok,"Walking through the market was fun. After bought our seafood, we followed the seller to a restaurant with our fresh live seafood, but the cooker was very mediocre, over cooked, rubbery, salty. Wish we know some good restaurants there before we went. So before you buy your live seafood, it is good idea to find out which restaurant to bring them to, or cook yourself."
Live fresh seafood ,"Loving this place, you can pick your own seafood lively and proceed to the restaurant and tell them how you want it to be cook. The price is very reasonable too. Good place to have fresh seafood. "
Fish for every dish!,This place was a bit interesting to find. We had to walk through a tunnel that dumped us into an older and newer fish market. We went to the older one to get a look at all of the sea creatures for sale. We were able to order items and get them cooked at restaurants near the market. It was a unique experience and I recommend going for freshly caught/cooked seafood. 
Affordable Live Seafood BUT Expensive To Have Them Cooked Upstairs,"We took the Seoul Metro to the market. We went there to check out if the seafood are cheap. Inside the building that houses the fish market, there are rows and rows of stalls selling seafood. We chose a stall to buy some seafood for lunch. After some bargaining, we bought a Snow Crab (1kg+), 6pcs of medium sized fresh Abalone, 6pcs of large Prawns, 10pcs of Scallops; all for KRW130,000. They stall operator recommended a restaurant upstairs that could cook the seafood for a fee. The restaurant, Dragon Palace, charges exorbitant price for cooking the seafood that we bought from the stall in the market. For all the seafood to be cooked, we were charged KRW80,000 (61% of what our seafood cost). We asked for a breakdown and we were given a ridiculous explanation.Therefore, I would recommend anyone who is interested to make a visit to check out the vast variety of seafood available. You should only buy the seafood IF you are staying in an accommodation with cooking facilities (bring the seafood back to your accommodation to cook)."
Below expectations ,Expensive but not much variety. Similar seafoods from each vendor. Poor environment but seafood is fresh. 
Another Must See in Seoul,"I never knew so many breeds, types and approaches to fish could be such a business. Many stalls with more fish and seafood than one can imagine. You can select your food downstairs and then be directed upstairs to have one of the restaurants prepare the food for you. Very interesting."
Cheap seafood,"Worth a visit, you have to cross the bridge above the subway, first you will find outdoor stands but I think indoor stands provide better quality and cheaper prices, so go straight to the building after.Enjoy 6 oyster at a price of 5000kwr or big clams which cost 5000 per piece"
Brilliant Sunday lunch ,A large platter of assorted sashimi' a dozen fresh oysters steamed' octopus sashimi still alive' sea squirt (something truly unique) a lobster from live to sashimi tail and remains simply steamed' and the grand treat for this lunch a whole king crab simply steamed 100% amazing' the whole meal costing little over 200 dollar how could you complain ' head for stall 16 at the second floor' for all you seafood to be cooked' love this place we shall return one day soon and bring the kids along amazing place for the whole family l! 
Seafood land,"pretty varied options, but pricey. The sellers are also pretty friendly. Just wish the seafood was more affordable and the restaurant options too"
The best fish market globally,The fish market is located partially in a modern building and partially in the old one.Use variety of fish and sea food and you can buy and take it to a market restaurant for preparation.The amount and variety of yellow fish tuna lobsters crabs rays squids and even sharks is more than you see while diving. Amazing and tasty
"tour guiding a Nigerian tourist, so happy visiting the market","exotic experience for foreigners, finding the octopus alive, a variety of fishery from all over the world."
Fresh and economic seafood meal!,"I went there for seafood lunch with my friends during my trip in June 2017. It was a pleasant and funny experience as we selected the fresh seafood by our own in the fish market and the fishmonger passed the selected seafood to restaurant which is on the 1/F of fish market. We simply went to the restaurant and waited for our food. We tried the uncooked sea intestine and octopus (i.e. sashimi). It was excitied and funny that you could feel the octopus moving in your throat. The chef just added sesame oil and salt on the sea intestine and octopus but it was superb tasty. Besides, we tried some roasted big clams and the big crab. We were all superb full after this delicious lunch. "
Fresh seafood,"I bought the seafood from the 1st floor and they introduce me with the restaurant on the 2nd floor. There are 2 type of charges, 1st they charge based on how many person who come to eat. 5,000 won/pax and 2nd they charged for the cooking fee. They also can speak chinese very well."
2 stories of fresh fishes.,"Although i'm not a fan of fish, my visit at Noryangjin Fish Market was great. Easy to find and access with the public transportation, you will find all kind of fish you can ever imagine.On top of that, you can chose some fresh fish from the fisherman and get it to a local ""restaurant"" on site. I had the best salmon and tuna sashimi ever.I think i got to pay a bit too much for it (Thanks for being a foreigner) but totally worth it.At the local restaurant there, what a great service and the staff is cool. Although the english is limited, you can easily manage your way around."
Seafood market,"Interesting visit to this seafood market a Korean friend recommended. All sorts of shells and fishes and octopuses. You select what you want to buy and the stall recommends a restaurant upstairs that can prepare it for you immediately. Live fishes were prepared immediately for sashimi, so they are very fresh.Many stalls have Mandarin speaking people, who can help if you can't speak Korean but can speak mandarin"
All sea creatures you can imagine ,"From the metro station, both the active parts of the old fish market and the new modern market building can be easily reached. You can buy and sometimes eat at market stalls, but also visit one of the restaurants in the new market building. This place is open (more or less) 24 hours, but most active in the early morning."
Seafood was cheap but cooking was a total rip off!,"Asian looking tourists need to be cautious as they walk through the aisles browsing at the live seafood as some Chinese speaking will try to be friendly and approach you to offer you their seafood at reasonable price.The catch is really on the cooking! The seafood as you see on the pics cost 55,000 won while the cooking came up to be another 51,400! I questioned the Chinese speaking restaurant staff on the breakdown to know that she was so hostile and not even bother to explain! I didn’t want to ruin my holiday with my children and left the place feeling ripped off! Please be careful should you visit the stalls and restaurants! I’m sure there are black sheep amongst them!"
Expensive seafood place!,"I understand that seafood expensive, but had expected it to be cheaper considering it’s a wholesale market. Am unsure if we got scammed slightly by the Chinese vendor.The idea is to buy the fresh/live seafood from one of the vendors at the wet market section. The vendor will then bring you and your paid seafood up to a restaurant in another place, where the restaurant will cook your seafood for a small fee.The experience overall was still memorable as we had live octopus. I will recommend getting seafood that can be eaten raw as you can’t get that level of freshness anywhere else!"
Expensive for the cooking,"The seafood is fresh (not cheap though) but the cooking service is too much over charged. We bought snow crab, abalone and scallop for about KRW 155,000 but the cooking charges was KRW 85,000 !!.Better dine at decent seafood restaurant at Myeongdong. Also no bill given feel like being conned by eating here so beware of this. I will not come back again."
Cheap seafood but expensive to cook it @ Palace Dragon mandarin speaking rest.,"We (2) bought a sashimi plate for $38. A live big clam and an small octopus for $14. Raw oysters for $5. A dude took us to a mandarin speaker waiter restaurant called Palace Dragon or Dragon Palace. Ordered one soju, stir fried the clam, cut the octopus sashimi style and bbq the oysters. IT CAME OUT FOR MAKING THOSE 3 ITEMS FOR $55!!! Hella expensive and a rip off..and they didn't even gave me a receipt!! TOTAL RIP OFF IN THE RESTAURANT!"
Good experience in Seoul....,"It is a fish market in a huge complex (several floors) housing more than few thousands shops. You can get everything which lives in water. You can bye and take the stuff on the top floor which is lined with several restaurants. They will cook for you for some charges. So, visit during lunch or dinner. And if you want to see the actual local flavor, visit the market early morning (1.00 a.m.) when auction is held. Metro: Noryangjin (Line 1) exit 1 or 8 (not far from Seoul Railway Station)."
"Used to love the old market, dislike the new characterless and expensive market",This is our second visit after 3 years. All I can say is the new market is a total disappointment. Characterless and lots of foreigners selling IMPORTED(so much more salmon being sold and prawns from south east Asia for example) expensive seafood. As the number of stalls have increased I see that most of the live seafood is not as fresh ie most are oxygen starved in crowded tanks. At the restaurants it is all about $. No longer a great local experience this has become just another place to eat expensive seafood especially if you dont speak the language. 
New experience in seeking seafood cuisine,"Eating at Noryangjin is not a novelty. I have been to many countries that do the same. But still there is something special about the place. How is how it works. Go look for the food (fresh) in the market. Pick the food you and at the price you want to pay. The seller will accompany you to the row of restaurant that will be so willing to cook it for you. Here is the difference. The variety span from huge snow crabs to oysters. Everything fresh (and moving). My kid was thrilled by the octopus. The sellers do allow him to play with the creature. The best of the whole buying experience is, you can pay by your credit card! Prices are very reasonable. I got the whole snow crab, abalone, sea cucumber, octopus, scallops for US$138. Have that cooked add the fried rice mixed into the crab shell, a hotpot soup and throw in a couple of drinks for another US$78. Total damage for a feast slightly over $200 that can feed 3-4 persons."
Great place for breakfast!Good place to stay with a friendly and helpful staff.,"Went at 5:00 am to see all the live seafood and ended up by picking what we liked, taking it upstairs to the various restaurants, and they cooked it up for us to have for breakfast! We had fish noodle soup, fried rice with roe, oysters in an omelet, steamed flounder, etc. It was really good and though it sounds strange to have all that fresh seafood for breakfast, I am sure you will enjoy it as much as we did!"
Awesome place to eat fresh seafood,It is not far as you can take 2 stops by subway from Seoul station. It is a big fresh fish market that sells everything those can swim. After buying seafood downstairs you are guided to upstairs where there are many restaurants that help tou cook. It costs a little bit more but it is worth as the food is so great. Try king-crab and sashimi! 
Go for the King Crab - that's the only highlight,"Noryangjin market is a definite place that you should come to if you are looking for a large size King Crab meal.Getting to this location is best by the subway, rather than taxi - during dinner time, the traffic was horrible and i had a pounding headache at the end of the taxi journey.lots of stalls selling King Crabs with various owners telling you why their crabs are better. You definitely need to bargain, do not be afraid to make a low bid, if the stall is sticky on the price, get them to give other freebies like clams, prawns, or abalones etcwe order also abalones, clams, prawns & sashimi. my verdict is that other than the King Crabs, the rest of the fare are simply average.after you order the food, it is passed over to another representative from a shop that will cook the crab for you. They charge a fee for the cooking and steam is the best way to have the crab IMO."
Five Star Fish market,The fish market does not stink...No signs of dirt or waste on the floor and well maintained. It is said to be the largest fish market in the world. most of the sea food are live and on demand the dress it up give it. There are near by outlets which offers good and sumptuous sea food. A varied experience . Never thought of visiting a fish market especially in a different country since my country is full of markets and fishes...
Cheap place for seafood,A must visit if you are a seafood lover. But take note that there are the original old fish market and the new fish market (a newer building) just next to the old one. The price at the old market is definitely much more cheaper (about half price) as compared to the new market. Order whatever seafood u like from the stall and the ahjuma will call their restaurant contact to bring you to have the seafood cook and eat at the restaurant. Walk around to compare the price but majority of them sell the same things and you can bargain abit for better pricing.
Just okay...,"This place was just okay. We checked out both the old market and the new market. Definitely the place to go to if you want live fish or crabs but I noticed most of their shrimp were frozen. Came for the live squid sashimi but you can also get that the Gwangjang market and would not have to travel far. Wished we had a Korean speaker with us as most of the vendors don’t speak English. Overall, probably not a place I would go to again."
Smelly great place,"It's smelly, fishy, but if you want a fresh yummy seafood then this is the place to go. It cannot get any fresher. you choose a fish that swims in a big water tank and after 20 minutes the fish you chosen is on the table for you to eat. Big, loud, usually crowded, get there early in the morning for the best deals."
Fresh live seafood experience!,There are many seafood vendors to choose from and restaurants upstairs to cook your food. There are comments about this place being expensive. Yes....you are not going to get a live king crab for $50 here. But it still will be a bargain compared to what you pay in the US. Also if you are spending some big cash don't be afraid to ask for some free extras for the vendors. Overall I would highly recommend coming here at least once for the experience and to get some super fresh seafood.
Fresh seafood but pricey for cooked items ,"This place is visited by their locals as well. Take subway to Noryangjin station exit 1. Walk across the bridge and you will come to this open air space/carpark, turn right and walk for another 3 meters. You will see a stairs with some Chinese words scribbled on the wall. 2 floors down and you will see the wet market. Prices are quite competitive. We walked 1 round and decided to settle for one of the stalls with local customers. Some stalls can communicate in Mandarin. 5 pieces of scallops ₩10000, 5 Xlarge prawns ₩10000, 5 small abalone ₩10000, 1 small fish ₩20000, 1 bag clams ₩10000. Simple cooking ie: bbq, steaming, stir fried (clams), pot of soup (fish) costs ₩38000. Whole meal costs us ₩98000 for 2 pax. Price did not include rice or drinks. I would say can come for the experience like witnessing your fish being killed in front of you etc. For cheaper alternative, go for sashimi style like most of the locals. You can't get to choose which shop to cook your food as it's all designated by the stalls. "
Pricey pricey,Be prepared for lots of accosting from the stallholders when you set into the place. The seafood is pricey and bringing it upstairs to the restaurant for sit-in meal is even more pricey. Not worthwhile to pay for the experience. We had better experience at a seafood restaurant in Myeongdong - fresh seafood and better value for $$.
Fresh seafood !!!,"We enjoyed our fresh seafood where we tried the live octupus, crab, fish where there are restaurants available to cook them for us. Price is a bit high maybe compared to Busan Jagachi market "
Just for the experience,There is a new and old market. The new one is cleaner and doesn't smell as much as the old one. Bought the seafood from the new place and bring it up to 2nd floor for them to cook. There's a lot of restaurants to choose from and prices are similar. But it is not cheap to eat there. Buying the seafood is already pricey enough. Letting them cook is expensive too. The charges are depending on what type of method you want them to cook. Total bill comes out to over $100 for 2 of us when we did not even order alot. I think eating out will be cheaper than this. I think there are more locals going there to buy the seafood to cook at home rather than asking the restaurants to cook. They charge a $5 USD for individual seating. The restaurant did recommend what type of style to go with the type of seafood but seems like everything they say best fit is grilled.Just an experience but probably not worth going again.
Must come!!,"Highly recommend this place if you are a seafood lover! Totally spoilt for choices here and the price is reasonable! First, you choose a stall and pick your seafood ( you pay for the price of seafood) then the stall owner will ask if you have a preferred restaurant in mind, if not they will recommend. Then they will take you to the restaurant and you can choose how you would like your seafood to be cooked! Steam, bbq, sashimi etc.. and you pay for the price of how it’s being cooked. It’s such an interesting experience for us! Do drop by! And it’s 24 hours!! "
A 100% must in Seoul ,"This is one of the most remarkable and unique experiences of the trip. There, you truly enjoy the Korean experience. A lot of young Koreans go there for dates or just to eat and drink with friends. If you like fresh and good quality seafood this is a total must! There is a metro station in front of the market so it's easy to get there. Note that there are two markets, the old and new one. I recommend to go to the new one since it's cleaner. The main idea here is to buy seafood in the first floor and then go upstairs (2nd floor) and go to a restaurant so they can cook it. There are plenty restaurants that offer the services, in fact I believe they only do that. They charge aprox 5,000 won per person so it's mad cheap. Also, while you are buying seafood sometimes you can find the ""agents"" of the restaurants upstairs so it's easier to talk to them rather than go upstairs without someone that can help you out. We bought: 1 kg of mid size shrimp 1 kg of live large scallops, half a pound of fresh salmon (in Korea you get very good quality salmon, they fly it in every day), 2 live flounders (1.5 kg each) , 1 live seabass (approx 2kg) for a total of 138,000 won (130 dollars). We were 8 people and we were all full. Note that you will have to negotiate always. Try to buy shellfish and fish from one person so they can make a bundle deal. You can deduct btw 10-20% of the starting price. The whole experience was amazing. Way better than see temples and palaces, this was truly Korean "
It's visit ( shouldn't be priorities) but expensive ,"Well it's ok to visit if you just have extra time. Nothing huge just simple fresh and live fish could cook for you in restaurant buying the fish is so expensive and cook in it even worse , and type of cook are limited to Koran because taste best option was grilled , I could eat 3 times more in amount I pay for that meal in any resturant in Seoul "
New facilities are beautiful!,"Since last october, they moved into a new building next door. Now 2 levels of seafood stalls and restaurants on the 2nd floor (now majority with tables and chairs vs. Floor seating). We had rock tai/aji sashimi, abalone, chige with the tai bones...DELICIOUS! Of course, everything is price negotiable for the seafood so give it a try!"
Very Fresh Seafood,"Loads of fresh seafood here. Had the king crab and abalones. Be wary of the prices as you will need to negotiate here.King crab costs about KRW 90,000 for 2kg+ crab.KRW 10,000 for 3 abalone."
dont haggle if you will not buy,"after nuying fresh fish, restaurants on the 2nd floor. choose from korean or somewhat japanese style restaurants :) they give freebies also"
"Fish, fish, fish!",Loads of freshly caught fish and other sea-stuff for sale. Fantastic how this works and interesting to see what things from the sea Koreans eat beside fish and shellfish... If you buy something they can send if upstairs where it is prepared for you.
Yummy sea food ,"We bought a 4-kg king crab at 50k won/kg (better bargain should be 35-40k won). And brought it up to 2nd floor restaurant for their cooking and some additional service charge. Still happy, as it is much more expensive in my hometown. Very fresh food, yummy. "
Amazing selection of live seafood!,There are hundreds of vendors selling every kind of live seafood you can imagine. Pick out what you want and they weigh it for you. You can either take it home and prepare it yourself or let them take it upstairs to the restaurant where they prepare it exactly how you want it. You can't get fresher seafood than this!
Excellent experience,"The market was very clean, easy to find ( thanks to google map), all the ahjuma and ahjussi were friendly, large variaty of sea food . We finally get to tried the king crab and its cheaper than where we come fromthe ambiance is so korean as we hardly saw tourists thereWe definately wud love to go back there again, its a must visit place in Seoul"
Seafood Feast (Oct 2015),"We skipped breakfast to visit this market for branch. The market is situated in a large building right next to the Noryangjin metro station. Once inside, the large building has a mezzanine floor for restaurants, and the main floor was just for selling tons and tons of seafood. Once you have picked them, you could bring them to the restaurants to cook for a fee. And so we walked around to pick some seafood, when up to a restaurant recommended by one of the seafood counter-owners. The different seafood we bought were obviously ok because they were all fresh, and we actually had lobster sashimi for breakfast! However, prices were not cheap, so don’t expect too much -- just tread it as a place to go for a walk and a bite."
Amazing place to spend few hours,"People are saying it is expensive but I think for this quality and choice and freshness it is not at all! Close to the metro station which is very handy. You can buy fres fish - fresh means alive an restaurants will prepare it for you - you can say barbecue and will know how to do it, we have bought f;at fish and giant claims (do not know the names) and it was delicious, do not forget soju:)I would advice to visit the ground floor first and after the first floor which is more lat is say modern."
Unique experience,"Expensive but unique experience. Walked around the market and eventually picked out a large crab. Had the runner bring it to one of the restaurants upstairs where it was steamed. Might not do it again, but as a unique touristy thing to do it was worth the trip."
Famous fish market!,"On our way to the 63 Building in Seoul we stopped by the Noryangjin Fish Market and was amazed by the variety of seafood available. We were only there for a short time but we saw jumbo-sized shrimps, lobsters, king crabs and lots of other sea creatures that I had never seen before. It's a nice place to buy your fish and have it cooked or fillet the way you wanted. We wanted to grab so much stuff but had other stops along the way. Wish we had more time so we could eat there!"
"Fresh catch, delicious food. Could work on the customer service.",Very little haggling. Take your time to shop around at the stalls for the best deal. Stay with your purchase until it gets to the restaurant. Use google translate as the restaurant owners are limited on English.
Unique and unforgettable experience,"The market was located near the subway station and was easily accessible.Choosing your seafood and have it cooked at the 2nd level is indeed a very unique experience for my family of 8.We didnt really look around different stalls and were approached by the 1st stall when we stepped in. As we saw some locals buying from the stall as well, we thought the pricing shd be reasonable. We paid 98k won for 1 king crab, prawns, clams, salmon, 7 abalone, octopus and a local fish. Seafood itself is cheap. The expensive part is getting a seat in the restaurant and getting it cook. i paid 88k won for 8 pax seats and steaming of most of the items and 1 bottle of korean beer. sashimi preparation is foc. I have the fish half in sashimi and half in soup. Overall i think the price is considered reasonable for the freshness and also unique experience. It is cheaper than eating the same items in my country. This place is one of the must see in my list."
great fish market for fresh seafood cooked on the spot,"This is a huge indoor fish market, where first floors are venders selling all sorts of live seafood! you come here, pick a shop; pay for the fresh seafood ingredients and a guy from the 2nd floor where all the restaurants are will bring the food upstairs and process/cook them for a price. Price is very good so this is a paradise for seafood lovers! this is one of my favorite place in Seoul!"
Very expensive,"This place is more for locals or tourists with a local guide. It's a typical wet fish market. Most of the seafood are still alive. I had to walk for quite sometime before a gentleman greeted me in English. Apparently, he speaks Mandarin too. So, lucky for us. He explained that I had to choose my seafood from his stall and then follow a lady to a restaurant where the seafood will be cooked and prepared. You have to pay the fish monger for the seafood and pay the restaurant for their service separately. There are a few restaurants so if you're picky, you might want to check out the restaurants first. The price was rather steep but we got to sit with the locals, on the floor, in the restaurant."
Fresh Seafood you must try,"It is a must go place for me as I love fresh salmon sashimi and it's my dream to try the king crab at least once in my lifetime. There's alot of things that you need to take note before going here. Your ability to speak basic Korean can determine whether you love or hate the experience. Bargain hard, it's your right! If they refuse to give discounts, ask for service, they might throw in some prawns or octopus for you :) Do not just buy from the first stall you see, explore around and find one with a good deal. Another important note, if you plan to dine here, there will be extra charges from the restaurant and this may vary in prices. So, ask their charges first before even agreeing to enter their restaurant. I will be going back again this year! "
Fresh Seafood,"Heard about the Noryangjin fish market - so we decided to make a trip to try out some seafood. Took the subway and it was conveniently located near the Noryangjin station with just about a 10min walk. There were many stores selling almost the same things. Basically you pick some seafood (be sure to bargain) and checkout several stores first before buying. They will then bring you up to a restaurant where they will cook for you.Overall we were very satisfied with the seafood - fresh, well prepared and yummy.The only thing to note is that thy will charge you for cooking the seafood etcThy charge by weight but you'll never know how much thy actually weigh. We paid about USD40 for cooking of lobsters, abalone, Scallop, prawns etc including drinks.But it's a good experience and satisfying dinner !"
Great place for authentique food,"Went there with some friends, including a local. This is essential if you want to experience the thing fully. We bought fish and had it cooked (some) in a top floor restaurant. Was great."
"If you like seafood, this is the place to come to in Seoul!","This fish market is smaller than the Tsukiji one in Tokyo, but there is one big difference, you can actually select the seafood (most are still alive) and have them deliver to a restaurant on the second floor to have it prepared the way you like. There are dozens of stalls each with tanks of live seafood - it is fascinating just walking from stall to stall and looking at the seafood. I was lucky to come with a local Korean so language is no barrier. The lobster and crab were huge - but for two of us, we selected abalones, clams and a fish. The fish was prepared 3 ways - Sashimi, grilled and the bones used as delicious fish soup. The abalone was grilled with butter while the clams were steamed. It was absolutely delicious. It was mid-priced - not cheap, but given the freshness and convenience, definately worth coming back."
Biggest king crab,The biggest King crab I ever seen.You can find many kind of sea product at this market.Just select payment and get it cook at the restaurant near by at the cheapest service fee
Huge,"We visited the Noryangjin Fish Markets today, free to get in and walk around.Loads and loads of different stores all selling much the same seafood.You will get harassed/approached by lots of the staff as you stroll through each isle.So many fish, crabs, lobster, prawns etc.Given the language barrier a little hard to ascertain the exact price. We did end up having a conversation in chinese (through my partner) and were advised you buy the seafood, take it upstairs to a restaurant who charges you $30,000 won to sit in the restaurant and then you pay a per kilo cooking fee. We opted out as it was too hard to work out watch you would actually pay although the seafood all looked great.Well worth the visit."
Rip off. Beware!,Not the first time here. Did it to re-experience from 3 years ago at the old market.Bought a large lobster & crab for $200.Then the restaurant (named Hwang Jae) charged me $60 to steam them. $60??? WTF? Never again.The lobster was over cooked and the crab was way too salty. 
Bargain with Vendors and don't follow the restaurant runner,"Direction: Noryangjin Station Exit 7 walk straight and uturn to an underground tunnel and you will see the new market. I have been here twice. The old one and the new one. You really have to shop around and check out the price per kg etc. Once you see the stall with the reasonable prices, get them to weigh every seafood and record the weight.* After that don't follow the runner. I got overcharged for the cooking fee at a restaurant named dragon head or something operating by some Chinese. 7,000 and/or 10,000 won per kg. Immediate regret. It has free wifi though. Walk around on the upper floors and ask the price. Not worth your time unless you have time to spare and you wanna eat live abalone. Go to the old market. I will never come back again. It is really a ripoff. "
Total Rip-Off !!!,"We visited Noryangjin market in July 2016, selected 1 small crab, 4 small abalones, a little bit of clams, 3 small whelks, a small piece of salmon at the ground floor wet seafood stall and they charged us 90,000Won. The worst part is we still had to pay another 60,000Won at the 1st floor small restaurant just for the seafood to be grilled !!!I personally DO NOT recommend this place for seafood as it was a Total Rip-Off !!!"
Lots of sea creatures ,A very nice market to visit. I had never seen most of the sea creatures there b4. It smells alot but you can endure it. I think the market is worth a visit. If I lived in Seoul I would buy different fishes and now a meal. But as tourist is a shame not be able to do so Take the metro and take the exit 7 I think....look at the exitmap an follow wich exit u need to take. When you exit the metro... just go straight about 5 min. Then turn right...follow the tunnel (Lots of older women selling vegetables there) to the end and you see the noryangjin market....first you see the new building and at the right side of the building there is the old market. My favourite was the old part.
Torts Are Everywhere,"New market is clean, bright and very different from other seafood market.We were there to understand and experience the different kinds of seafood that be found in Seoul.Varieties are great and fascinating.However, TORTING is very rampant to a point it was very disturbing. It seems that the absence of PRC tour groups have deeply impacted the business.It will good if the authority can look into this else the TORTS will severely impact the reputation of the fish market"
Go once justfor the experience,"It's a fish market so expect the noise and smell. The old market (nearer to train station) is still operating however places to have your bought seafood cooked is limited and dinghy looking. So we did not buy any seafood but just walked straight through onto the newer market. New market is better lit, better laid out but still wet and fish smelling! Almost all vendors sell the same variety of seafood so unless you want to patiently scout and compare for the cheapest or you could just target one stall and negotiate for the best price you are willing to pay. Becoz it's a tourist trap you are bound to get fleeced regardless. A young Chinese speaking tout followed us around the entire market which made us feel really uncomfortable. Eventually he confessed that he wanted us to come with him to the restaurant he worked for upstairs to get the seafood cooked. Pls note this cost is separate so do budget for another KRW7k-10k per separate dish to be cooked. There were some hard negotiations between us and the owner and they kept insisting all shops will charge the same for cooking fees therefore no need to price hunt anymore. Totally I paid KRW85,000 for small Alaskan crab, KRW10,000 for 4 small abalones, KRW15,000 for 6 small sea urchins = KRW110K plus another KRW25k for steaming and side dishes. Don't follow the tout, although the restaurant he brought us to was clean, the service was poor and servers try to push sell you with the more ways to cooked seafood and extra costs of course! Do price research prior to going back to "
King Crab! ,"We took subway line 4 then line 1 to Noryangyin Station, look for exit 1/2. We took wrong exit and ended up got lost... There are 2 fisherman market, we went to the old one first, was interested what the new one looks like so we didn't buy anything from the old market. The new one was just next to it - much better environment, not sure why they don't move all vendors. We bought live octopus, King Crab, Abalone, shrimp, uni and clams. A guy from one of the restaurant on 2nd floor lead us the way to the restaurant. We think the restaurant charged too much, consider we only paid $125 for all the seafood while the restaurant charged us $58... live octopus was a fun experience. "
Live octopus! Need game plan to shop for seafood,"Eating live octopus is on our list for this trip. It was fun and unique experience. There are many fish stalls inside both new and old markets. The sellers kept selling aggressively. So it helps if you have ideas of what kind of seafoods you want first. Go around most of the stalls at least once before started the conversation with the sellers and until you found the one has all of seafood type you want. The sellers started with a higher price, there's room for negotiation if you purchased all your seafood in one stall. Each stall works with a restaurant who will cook the seafood for you. The restaurant is not fancy just an authentic place to enjoy the fresh seafood."
Fun at Seafood Market,"My family has been wanting to try live octopus and this is definitely on our top priority to do list when we visited Seoul. Other than live octopus, we get to select other live seafood and have them cooked the way you want it. Wonderful experience!"
Lots of options,"It's a great place with lots of options. Kind of far, if you don't have a car. However, you can find cabs riding down the highway."
No worth the time spent,"It took a bit of time to get there are it was not in the city centre. We got there on a weekday afternoon and it was very quiet. There are 2 sections, the new and the old. The new is clean but the old section has more of a fish market feel. Our tour guide told us honestly that the seafood was expensive and it would have been cheaper to order seafood from a restaurant. Everyone was selling about the same thing. Even though there were restaurants nearby who would cook what you buy, they didn't look like places that I would eat in. Can't be compared with the Japanese seafood markets."
Seafood market,"Big seafood market. Note there are two markets, one which is older and one new.If you buy any of the seafood, you can bring them to the first floor of the new market and go into one of the resturants and get them to cook for you.Warning : getting the resturants to cook is not cheap but maybe we were ripped off. There are two of us and we paid 30, 000 won for the resturant to cook for us , mind you cooked only two steak salmon!!!"
fisheries show,"this market is the largest fish market in korea i think and i can't remember having seen something similar in other places in Korea (even in Busan). I do not like raw fish but I found very interesting to watch at all the different fishes and seafood and the life of the market. There are other types of seafood that in Europe. Tough, if you are not a seafood or market lover, i would not recommend the visit as there are no other sights nearby. My korean Mum bought a fish that the fishmonger prepared as sashimi to eat at home (and some beef for me from another shop !) You should not expect some cheap prices because it is a large wholesale market if you buy as private. As an industrialized and rich country, prices are in Seoul generally very similar to Europe (for instance France or Italy). Dry fish specialities (dry anchovies for instance) and Korean ginseng are expensive !"
Interesting,"A huge variety of fresh seafood. Interesting to see a fresh sea worm, red clam/coral. Abalone is a much And it's really delicious. Friendly vendors with very competitive pricing. No need to really bargain but no harm asking, we had free prawns. "
There’s a world of crustaceans in here,"Whoever invented the fish market with attached restaurant was a genius. Because what better way to entice customers into consuming a highly perishable food than offering to cook it right then and there?Here’s a fish market with the luscious lobster, springy calamari and plump shrimp I want on my lunch plate or dinner table tonight. This Seoul destination also functions as a eatery, complete with floor seating and table service on the upper level. What you’re buying here may or may not be, but it’s high quality and a worthy splurge.The most remarkable part of the market is its expansive selection of whole fish as well as live seafood, including eels, crabs, lobsters and sea urchin. Browsing the colorful, enticing sea creatures is irreplaceable. This is the true truth as I say it as it is…"
Accessible but expensive,"It is easy to travel there by the subway and once you tap out, you'll see many signs directing you to the market. It is tough to haggle sometimes, with sellers attempting to give you free seafood instead of lowering the price. Once you enter, it is quite likely that a local would start following and helping you to communicate with the sellers. This local would be an employee from one of the restaurants on the second level who would bring you to his restaurant subsequently where they will help cook the seafood which you have bought. Although the final cost is pricey, the seafood is indeed fresh. If you don't mind skipping the experience of the market, I would suggest just going straight to a well-known seafood restaurant in the city as the price point would be similar."
Expensive but worth a visit,"We were looking for a nice but not crowded place to have lunch and suddenly the idea of eating at a local fish market crossed our minds. Location was good as it took only few minutes from subway station. There were hundreds of stall selling fresh seafood. We chose to buy at the outside and old area, and brought what we had to a nearby restaurant so they helped us to cook. Seafood was of course really fresh, delicious. Service was good though people could speak a very basic English. It was expensive but worth a visit and try I think."
Too pricey!,It is too expensive and we still have to pay the restaurant to cook for us. Not worth the visit. They kind of standardized the prices among the stall too. 
"Eat eat eat, go by subway train and easy to access to this place. And worth the money to have the shasimi.supposed ","I love the shasimi, worth the price. And really fresh as if you enjoy drink ( alcohol). You should have to enjoy with shake. Highly recommend. Go Go Go "
confusing,"Warning! Bad English! The market is very close to Noryangjin MRT station. Walk out of exit 1 and you will find a bridge on your left. Cross the bridge and you will find the old market, so keep walking until you see the new building. If you want to eat, go to the second floor, there are almost 20 restaurants but they seem to sell the same food. One rule that you need to know is you have to bring your own raw seafood! People buy them from the first floor and bring to the restaurants. The standard seating charge is 3,000 won for one person which include fresh vegetables and dipping sauce. They will charge you for cooking but I did not remember the rates (standard rates for most restaurants). I bought only one tray of sashimi, no raw food for cooking so they charged me 5,000 won/person instead of 3,000 won!!!They have basic menus like fish bone soup that you won't need to have your own materials. I ordered one pot of soup and it costs around 10,000-15,000 won. In total I paid 25,000 won for the soup, two bowls of rice and seating for two people. Most restaurants, guests sit on mats with shoes off just like traditional Korean style."
"Reasonable price, must try",Bargain bargain and bargain! That's the rule in all markets. No need to feel shy :)Nice seafood but always in seafood price.
For experience.....okay,"4 of us ordered king crab 2.3kg with the price of 115k and plate of sashimi 20k, the owner bonus 3 pices of orange shell (dont know what it is) and 4 abalone cost us 10k. The owner helps us to discount on cooking restaurant. The female king crab meat is a bit soft not good as male king crab (more expensive)."
For experience.....okay,"We went with my friend last April 16, 2017 around noon. I agree, the seafood's are fresh and almost all stall have the same price. The second floor was closed like some abandoned facilities (kind of scary) and trash was still inside. We tried looking for a restaurant outside the market and found one. If you are looking for some market experience then this will be okay but if you want to eat live octopus, there are decent restaurants that offer that menu."
Nice place but the staff are a little fishy,I enjoyed my time there. We eat the live octopus. We were able to choose what we wanted right out of the fish tanks so you know everything is fresh. They have restaurants that cook the food for you located right above the market. 
Super fresh seafood ,"Affordable and extremely fresh seafood. The life octopus is a must-try! You can also opt for live fish to be instantly cooked into soup. The king crabs are rather reasonable in price (130,000 wons for a super huge crab). Take note that the default soup flavour is quite spicy, you might want to specially remind them to cook differently if you can't take spicy. "
A place to eat LIVE octopus and King Crab!!,"Noryangjin fish market is the largest and most popular seafood market in Seoul. You can buy other kinds of fresh seafood that are fresher at Noryangjin Fish Market at very low prices. The most common seafood sold are clams, king crab, abalone, shrimp, sting ray, sea cucumber, octopus, halibut, giant lobsters, eel, sea bass, snappers, sea urchins, salmon, and tuna...After buying your fish or seafood someone will direct you to a nearby partner restaurant, where you can find sit-in restaurants, they will cook and then serve them as a meal to you with due the separate fee you have to pay for condiments and cooking methods. How to Get there? : Getting to Noryangjing Fish Market is easy! If taking the Seoul metro, get off on the Noryangjin station (Line 1/Blue Line). TGo up the stairs and go straight to Exit 1 (look for signs for the Fish Market) and follow signs to a stairway leading down to ground level and from there you can enter the warehouse.*Note : Pay in cash! They do not accept you pay with credit cards."
Delicious king crab,"Choose the seafood that you want at the market and then the restaurant upstairs will cook the seafood for you. My family bought a king crab and a sole fish. The restaurant boiled the crab for us and deep-fried the fish. The seafood was served with rice, salad, kimchi and spicy sauce. It was delicious, although overpriced."
A must... if you enjoy raw food,Great place to eat the freshest seafood! You can eat sashimi of great quality and quantity IF you negotiate hard!
Just don't go there,"We went there following the suggestion of the lonely planet guide and we were incredibly disappointed. It is basically a huge smelly fish market where you can buy and have cooked your own food. (Quite hard to buy it due the very poor English spoken in the market). However we managed and we spent about 30 Euro for some fish( some prawns and clams). Then they bring you upstairs where a ""restaurant"" will cook for you the fish. Basically for doing some bbq and a small soup we paid over 30 euro. Considering that we were brining our own fish, I found this incredible. Plus it wasn't that good.I would strongly recommend to not waste your time and money there. There are several places in Seoul where you can eat better and spend less."
Pricey but good experience,"This place has a lot of seafood that you can probably find near your hotel, but the experience of walking past these stalls is quite an experience. We chose a plate full of sashimi after making several rounds over and over again. We tried to pick a place that didn't have overcrowded tanks and dead fish floating inside (not a good sign). Once we picked our plate of sashimi for $20,000 won (we didn't bother to haggle but you can), we paid and they led us upstairs to a restaurant. The chopsticks and spoons are inside the side drawer of the table you are sitting at. It should be the drawer facing the aisle.We ordered Makouli (Korean alcohol) and at checkout (you pay at the register) it was $10,000 won which we thought was very pricey for 1 Makouli bottle since it's super cheap at any 7-11 or convenience store. Great experience but wouldn't order alcohol again. "
If you love fresh seasfood - this should definitely be a stop on your list!,"There's actually two sections of this market: the new and the old. While the new is nice, I definitely recommend the old for cooked dishes - go, pick out your fish and seafood and the vendor will bring you to a partner restaurant for them to cook it up for you on the spot. While we did not get it, the king crab looked to be quite popular. We got some clams, scallops and the live octopus, which forewarning, is not for the faint of heart. It's a little bit creepy how it still moves even after the dish is served, but it was our hands down favorite part of the meal - a must try for any adventurous foodie! Don't fill up in this section however, go to the new part of the market and get a platter of fresh sashimi - but a warning, the vendors will try and bring you to a partner restaurant where you have to pay a table fee. We decided to cheap out and enjoy our sashimi bonanza at a plastic table upstairs from the restaurants and brought our own soy sauce and chopsticks - so fresh and sooo good!"
must visit,"i visited both the old and new market.the new market is clean, bright and odor free.we have our lunch at the new market, slightly pricy but worth to try."
Freshes Seafoods,"Although this place have a very strong seafood smell (like a typical Singapore wet market) but it is a must visit place for seafood lover when you visit Korea. All the seafood here are very fresh and after you bought the seafood from the store, the restaurant staff will guide you to their restaurant and they will cook the seafoods for you! "
Interesting ,This was a must do. You will see all kinds of interesting things and then you buy what you want then take it over to the restaurant and they'll cook it up for you. 
Noryangjin fish market,"What an amazing experience. Of all the times we've been to Korea, we have never been here before. My only recommendation would be to walk around first before getting sucked into a vendor. We weren't sure what to do so when my mom asked one of the ladies we got pressured into buying our fish from her but she had no other types of seafood. After we went up to the restaurant my mom had to go back down to find different types of shellfish for us to try. Other than that it is a definite must try if you are a seafood lover!"
Fab experience ,We went here twice during a Seoul visit. The first time we bought some large prawns and abalone which we then had cooked for us in one of the restaurants upstairs.The second time we went all out for a huge snow crab with a big plate of sashimi. It was cooked and prepared for us upstairs. We ate in many places while we were in Seoul including Michelin star food but this was the best meal of the week!Well worth a visit even if you are not planning to eat but do eat if you have time - it is a great experience. You obviously pay for the fish and you then pay for the restaurant to cook it. I am not sure how this really works out but we paid about 25.000 won for it both times (plus drinks) for the whole party.
Great experience!,"Vin Merlot, Mrs Merlot and son young Merlot travelled by subway to this market for the experience. Vin hails from a long line of fishmongers, having started at the Melbourne fish market when he was 7 years old helping Papa Merlot.The great advantage of this market is that whatever you choose to purchase you can take upstairs to be cooked for you in one of the many restaurants. We arrived about 10am which was a non busy time with many vendors and restaurants having a mid morning break but still serving.The women vendors were dressed in pink aprons. We witnessed the full range of sales techniques from friendly and helpful, to a little forward but with good humour to plain pushy and no humour!!We weren't hungary but bought half kilo of prawns to have them cooked upstairs. I am surprised by some of the TAs views that it was expensive. Half kilo of good size prawns 14000Kwon (approx $AUD 14). Cooking price with green tea for three, plus condiments 16,000 Kwon (approx $AUD 16). We thought that was fair plus restaurant staff very helpful, despite little English but they somehow twigged we were ""kangaroo"".Then went back downstairs to the old market part to return to a fishmonger who had been helpful in explaining his products in limited English. Needless to say he was delighted and probably surprised to see us but we bought a large plate of sashimi 20,000 Kwon (approx $AUD 20) and a fillet of salmon a bit more than half a kilo for 20,000 Kwon all of which 4 of us have eaten tonight.Perhaps pick your time and we're closed shoes and you will have great time. A stroll down memory lane for Vin, highly recommended and a vwobderful experience!"
Skip this,We decided to give this place a go despite reading bad reviews and they were right. It is a tourist trap so unless you plan to buy and cook your own food give it a miss. You get to see some fresh seafood but it gets repetitive. They will push you to buy fresh seafood and will bring you to a bunch of restaurants upstairs and charge you exorbitantly to cook it. Worst meal we had in Seoul. And it costs an arm and a leg. Many better markets around the world. Don't waste your time. Go to a pub and have a beer instead...
Go with a local ,Go with a local and let him/her do the talking. They will tell you different more expensive pricing when they realize you are a tourist. You choose what seafood you want and they will take you to a restaurant where they'll cook what you chose at the market. It is interesting for a first visit but I wouldn't go again.The floors of the market are all slippery and wet so careful with your choice of shoes. 
Fresh seafood at great prices,"You can walk around the market and choose the seafood you want to eat, then you can bring it up to the restaurants on the 2nd floor to have them cooked the way you want it."
Fish everywhere ,"Wow any kind color of fish, she'll fish, lobster and crabs. Live fish and prepared fish. Very friendly trying to sell you must be careful cars trucks motorcycle everywhere."
Interesting experience!,"My experience on Noryangjin Fish Market was an interesting one. Apparently, I learnt that I came at the wrong time. My wife and I came around 6pm and the market was so crowded with locals! After we bought our seafood ingredients, the restaurants were full and we were stranded with no place to go. I almost wanted to give up because we were hungry and it was hard to communicate with the locals. After almost an hour, we finally found a table to settle down and got our ingredients cooked and served. That was when the night got slightly better. The highlight of the night was the live octopus. Loved it. Not cheap, I guess.Throughout our dinner, two local guys who sat beside us even shared their sashimi with me. They spoke basic English and they were very polite. Delicious food and what a night it was. I recommend the visit due to its uniqueness but not during their peak hours."
Fish Market in Middle of Seoul,"From the 66 building, this is only a mile or two to drive. Price is ok, if you came from North America. Very clean and no smell foul that you normally have in a wet market. Ocean products comes in different varieties of types and sizes. You have options on the restaurants that prepare the food. You can do traditional sitting, low table(cross-leg) or with the standard chair and table. We did the traditional settings and I did survived the cross legged for an hour. A very good experience and a must see. You should be able to speak korean or have a good tour guide in buying and preparing the food. Excellent food."
Good seafood market in Seoul,"First time to Noryangjin Fish Market, the market size is big with variety of fresh and dried seafood."
Good for seafood lovers,"Seafood is not my cup of tea but I happened to be there one morning, walked around and took photos, the seafood was pretty fresh."
the most original place in seoul,"once you arrive with the metro to noryangjin stop you will have to pass trough the railway station , there is some small streets or a bridge. be also careful there is to fish market , the traditional and 50 meters after the new market, you have to see both"
a fishmarket that's bit different from what you might have seen before,"we got here very early in the morning and the place was packed. What's different about this market is that it has an enormous amount of fish tanks. What you may not like is seeing alive and dead fish in the same tank but to me it beats seeing live fish on a tray with no water and they're gasping for air. The selection of mussels, small and large fish, crabs, etc. is pretty incredible. You can take an escalator and see things from above to get a better view. It wasn't overly smelly there. Been to many where the stench was overbearing."
Fresh experience ,"Bargain, bargain, bargain. It can be tiring if one doesn't like it. So Noryangin may be a one-off experience for us. King crab was fabulous tho it's was only boiled. Grilled abalone was to die for.Best prices we got for the seafood before cooking:King crab: KRW155K for 2.8kg ++ crabAbalone: KRW10K for 3 good sized onesWish you guys luck!"
For seafood lovers!,I'm the grilled fish lovers so this is my best place for finding good and fresh fish in Seoul. You can find variety of fish selections at wholesale price. Everything here is fresh and still can be negotiable. There also small restaurant on 2nd floor if you want to cook right away and small stall on ground level beside the building. They also have a new fish market beside old market.
Very fresh seafood for Seafood Lovers,It's very big fisheries market in Seoul. Very convenience to visit by subway. There are 2 buildings (Old and New) and some items are different. It's better to visit the New Building first and go to 2nd Floor to meet visit the prospected restaurant and ask the staff or chef to go with you to select the items. He/ she can recommend you what kind of menu that suitable for each one.
Not very nice and pricy. Tourist trap,"Nice fish market to walk around and seafood is fresh. But the restaurants on the second floor is quite pricy. 3000won to get seated per person and 10,000-15000 to cook a dish. Feels like a tourist trap as it standa"
Unique fish market,"Great fish market consists of two parts old and new in a modern space. Do not hesitate to choose the live fish, which will bring in a restaurant. I suggest you should try the live small octopus. Enjoy the fresh raw fish."
Not worth visiting ,"Nothing compared to Tsukiji Japan. Not worth visiting. You basically shop for seafood downstairs and bring it to 2nd floor where you can choose a restaurant to cook for you. But .. Cost $3000 w per person service charge for seating in the restaurant. Cooking charges is $7000 w per dish. For 4 dishes and 4 person - need to pay $40,000w, that's with zero food. Prawns, abalone are charge by per kg. "
Restaurant was a rip off. ,"While asking around for directions from the Noryanjin station, we bumped into one of the restaurant chefs. Though her, we were introduced to the wholesaler. The first good point about this fish market is that by linking up with the restaurants before buying the seafood saves you money. We bought 10 scallops and 1 Grouper fish at 10,000 won and 20,000 won respectively. That was good value because they were charging us twice the amount before realizing that we already had 'connections' with the restaurant.Unfortunately, the dining experience was a huge let down. The scallops were too salty , and the fish had too much seasoning for a fresh seafood. We couldn't taste the essence of a live seafood. Secondly, they charged us additional 10,000 won and 15,000 for cooking the scallops and fish. On top of that, 4,000 won for me and my mum for seating.While the fresh seafood is cheap and good, the dining experience was a bummer. It might be that sole restaurant called 'The Chef' that was a poor choice on our part."
"Thumbs down, really.","The reason I rate this place terribly is because I am comparing this place to the many fish markets I have visited before in Japan, Taiwan and China. Fresh seafood is a given and what else do you expect? However, the cooking is another matter. At Tsukiji in Tokyo, you eat exquisite sashimi and sushi. Fresh fish cooked in Chinese style brings out the delicate texture of the fish. Noryangjin is a letdown in the dining aspect. The only exception is the grilled Alaskan crab.The ground level is where fresh seafood is sold but it is advisable not to buy yet. It is more important to go upstairs and get a table in any of the restaurants. The restaurants have linked up with the vendors anyway and will get the type of seafood you desire. If you have not been to a fish market, then Noryangjin or other seafood markets in South Korea would be an eye opener otherwise it is nothing unique. Allocate 10-20 minutes of exploring a section of the vast market then head upstairs for lunch or dinner. Avoid peak period if you do not have any reservation."
Worth Visiting if You're Willing to Bargain,"PRICE: We went to the old fish market (right next to the new fish market) b/c that's where it seemed like most of the locals were going. The only issue is that you have to speak Korean/Chinese in order to bargain properly in that environment. The prices are very fluid and rather than decrease the price of the seafood that you want, it seems more effective to try to get more of each item given a certain price (ie. 4 octopus for 10,000W rather than 3 octopus). Despite probably being overcharged (b/c we're very obviously foreigners with our cameras and all), the pricing was decent.QUALITY: All the seafood at the market is very fresh and pretty good quality. I personally think everyone should try the live octopus and the tuna. If you go early enough and ask around, you can get them to cut out a fresh portion of the entire tuna belly for a decent price (maybe 50,000W?).RESTAURANT: We originally went to a restaurant deep in the old fish market on the first floor, but the lady was very aggressive and wanted to overcharge us (3000W per person for seating and side dishes + 20,000W to cook the food after a lot of bargaining [we didn't buy that much food, plus the lady at the entrance of the market that we spoke to told us that she wasn't going to charge us for sashimi, so we could always go back to her as a fall-back plan]), so we left. Instead we went to a restaurant on the second floor (the middle of the market) which immediately charged us 27,000W to prepare all of the food for us (no bargaining needed!). Furthermore, the second floor restaurant was a lot cleaner and had a better overall ambience, so we went with the restaurant on the second floor."
Worth visiting,It was an eye opener to see such wide varieties of seafood. You can choose from over 50 stalls. Most of them can speak mandarin but not so much on English. Of course cooking of the seafood will be additional cost. I would recommend going to the old market as it has a traditional fish market feel. 
Eye opener! Frash seafood at great prices! ,This place is highly recommended for all tourists! The seafood was fresh and fantastic! The price was very reasonable too. There are 3 restaurants around that will cook your seafood buys for you. Will definitely come back again! 
Over priced and lots of haggling,"We initially wanted to have our dinner at the market, after hearing that we can pick our fresh fishes and have them cooked. The market was large, with many stores neatly arranged in rows selling almost the same thing. This has obviously caused a lot of competition among the stall holders. Seeing us as a large group (12 of us), we were being tugged and haggled by almost every stall to buy from them. Mistaking us from mainland China, they started speaking mandarin to us. We stopped at a stall to inquire on the price of the king crab, which is apparently in season, and was shocked that it will cost us 200,000 Won (cost of cooking not included). Since we are a big group, we will need 2 crabs....! Now, this is much more expensive then in Japan or even at the seafood restaurant back home. Frustrated, we left the place and decided on dinner elsewhere. "
King Crab Feast!,"We actually visited both old and new market but decided for the new for hygiene sake. It's definitely worthwhile to get your hands on to the king crab that you will never able to get in SG for $120, at 2.2Kg! We also got ourselves a big plate of fresh salmon at $12 and 2 tiger prawns and 4 small abalones for $24! Tell me now, where to get? But do note that buying of the seafood and the restaurant fees are different. Thus you will need to pay extra cooking fee when you eat in-house at level 2."
See-food,"Local markets are always a sight to behold, as they exude so much of the local culture. In terms of uniqueness, markets will always be markets, but that doesn't mean the Noryangjin Market is not worth the time.In fact, come prepared with your cameras to capture some of the most amazing seafood up for sale in this market. You can see a lot of different seafood up close, such as stingrays, abalone, lobsters, crabs and even eels. Just be sure not to stay at each stall for too long and take too many photos, because some shop owners will not be pleased and are generally intolerant with tourists. Some owners will be outrightly displeased and may even scream at you, but that is just how they are, so as long as you ignore them you will be fine.If you do love sashimi, choose a friendly shop owner and they will recommend the freshest fish to you. Of course, coming in a big group and ordering more will also mean that you can get bigger discounts. One thing I recommend is to try sannakji (산낙지), which is live octopus. Be careful, though, as the tentacles may suck onto your tongue, so be sure to chew it thoroughly before swallowing it. It is a pretty unique experience that you should try since you are already there anyway.To get there, take Seoul Subway Line 1 to Noryangjin Station, and get out from exit 1. You will cross a small overhead bridge over the train tracks, and then walk down several flights of stairs to the market."
Good place for fresh seafood,"It is easy to get here by train. Short walk (200m) through an ally and you will reach this market. You may get a lot of fresh seafood and plenty of restaurants can prepare seafood selected by you. I suggest you cook them yourself if you stay in Seoul long enough. Since there are many Chinese visitors, price of seafood is not much cheaper than those in local market. Worth to pay a visit if you love seafood. "
Market was interesting but......,"It was a good experience at the market. The kids saw many interesting seafood. The sellers do not speak English but they speak Mandarin so it helps if you can speak Mandarin. We don't know much about the prices of seafood. We bought a king crap, lobster, 4 pc of abalone and half a portion of salmon sashimi for KRW100,000. Not sure if that is cheap. We realised that there will be a ""runner"" once they know you are going to buy some seafood so that they can set up the restaurant to cook your food. They will whisk the food away from you to the restaurant which is located behind the market. We basically had steamed crap and lobster, barbecued abalone, fried seaweed rice (using crab roe) and salmon sashimi. The steamed lobster was not done well. The meat was hard and we could hardly eat it. Perhaps it shouldn't be steamed but this was recommended by the restaurant. The cooking of the food is a separate charge that cost us KRW60,000 for just steaming, barbecuing and 3 portions of fried rice with no drinks. I think that is very expensive considering we only paid KRW100,000 for the seafood. So be very careful with the restaurant charges. It's the most expensive meal we had in Seoul!!!"
Fresh & Cheap Seafood!,"Went on a Monday afternoon to avoid crowd. Easy access via overhead bridge connecting the train station. Walked between the old and new and had lunch at the old market. Fresh snow crab & lobster about KRW42k each and other seafood such as bamboo clams, little oysters, prawns & live octopus about KRW10k each type. Seller brought us to a nearby stall that help customers cook the seafood to their liking at a charge. We paid about KRW50k for 4 pax 7 dishes. Not sure if this is reasonable, guess depending where you come from.Remember to pickup a latte or smoothie outside the markets at a little store between both market."
Cheap and fresh seafood,"Went to Noryangjin twice and bought scallops, prawns, salmon sashimi, oysters, king crab, abalones and octopus. Each time, it cost us about 50,000 won. On both occasions, we went to the same restaurant on level 2 which charged us 25,000 won with soju included. Great price for super fresh seafood! Would go back again in future!"
A great experience!,"The Noryangjin Fish Market is easily accessible by metro.You should come early morning to benefit from the most exciting period of the market. You can buy your fish here and bring it to the restaurants nearby to have it cooked!Try it, it's worth the experience!"
Seafood market,Noryangjin Fish market is a must go place for me. Every time I go to Korea I must bring my friend and my family to there and eat seafood. I like this place because you can choose seafood on the first floor and ask people there to cook it for you. Also there are people that they can speak Chinese so there is no problem for communicating how the seafood are being cooked. I think the price is not very expensive (middle price) and the taste of the seafood is very fresh. Until now I can still remember the taste of those seafood which make me want to go visit in the near future.At last I would like to recommend you check carefully for the location because it is quite hard to find that place if you are not well prepared.
Seafood lover's paradise,"A new complex building was opened recently. There are still stalls being operated in the old wet market though. The two are just adjacent to each other. On the second floor of the complex building are restaurants. At a certain fee, they can prepare the seafood you bought from the market for you. To go to the market, simply take metro and gat off at Noryangjin station. Take the bridge at the exit and follow the path to reach the staircase entrance to the fish market."
Seafood Galore,"A seafood paradise and not a place to meet if you are a seafood lover. Everything from Alaskan king crabs, prawns, scallops, etc are either alive or super fresh. A must visit!!"
Brand new fish market building,"Went there 2 years before at the old market which was pretty dark and wet. Heard that a new market was opened in April and we decided to give it a try again.The new building was bright and spacious but most of the vendors there were Chinese which was good for us because we came from Hong Kong. After a good bargaining on seafood, we went upstairs and entered a restaurant that had most customers. We had King crab, abalone, sushi and octopus/fish soup. Everything was very tasteful and the price was far too good compared with Hong Kong."
Don't be put off by bad reviews,"Not saying they are the most honest people on earth but please do not be put off by bad comments. After reading the reviews, I nearly gave this place a miss but thankfully I didn't. Most commented about how they feel cheated about the food preparation cost. I felt that way initially but when I questioned the cost (with my limited Korean), I began to understand how it works. So the usual 5000won or so includes the side dishes, drinks and the provision of a place for you to eat. If you need then to cook season, the extra cost will depend on the amount of cooking required. So the more cooking or preparation you required for your food, you will pay more. The culinary skills does leave much to be desired. BUT since I was there for LIVE seafood, what better way than sashimi or steaming it. The natural sweetness of the fresh seafood is to die for!Expensive? Perspective here please. Needs some bargaining but it's not crazy. Most shops quoted me within a certain range. Standard prices for 4small abalones - 10,000won. Bought a king crab for 75,000won and got the lady to throw in some raw baby octopus. Found out that I probably overpaid for the crab and went back another day. The shop owner recognized me immediately and I told her to give me a discount because I overpaid the last time. No questions asked, 65,000 (approx 65usd) for a much much bigger king crab this time. And she threw in more baby octopus this time. The crab would probably cost 3 times here in Singapore so I'm not complaining. Then again, things are always so expensive here in Singapore so... it's really where you come from and the value you see in the seafood. Try it for yourself. "
Be careful,"We visited Noryangjin Fish market in Oct.2016. We purchased some seafood down stairs and they took us upstairs to eat. We were told the table charge won 5,000 (about $5) per person, about total won 10,000 (about $10) But the price raised to won 24,000 (about $24) when we sat on the table.I heard so much about this place.But, very disappointed as we visited after we saw and heard about this place.I will not recommend this place to any of my friends!!!"
Fish market,"The market is full of all kind of seafood such as crabs; huge crabs, flounders, other fish, octopus....It is a huge market. You can buy fish, or any kind of seafood and have them cook upstairs in any restaurant for a certain price.It is a little expensive I think and even to have it cook.It is one time experience..."
Great seafood but.....,"Interesting huge local + tourist seafood market. Wide range of fresh and iced SF, reasonable price.But then the restaurants just don't handle / cook the SF right. What a waste!"
Just for the experience ,"Bring my 6th month old baby along, and I don't think here is a suitable place to bring baby along. Bought some fresh seafoods (prawn, abalone, scallop and shell) from the market and bring it to the nearby restaurant for lunch. That's only two way to prepare for the food. Either steam or bbq ( fried with butter may be). The seafoods all taste the same after cooked. nothing special to me. "
Definitely not like how it is on TV,"After seeing this place on Travel channel I've always wanted to go. You buy what you want to eat then take it to a close by restaurant in the same building or outside area. Buying your choice of seafood is pretty fun since there's sooooo much to choose from. Then you take it to a restaurant to get it cooked or prepared for you, now here's the downfall... It seems almost no one wants to prepare what you bought but we finally found a place which was outside. It was a bit pricey seeing it's not like you have to purchase the food from the person cooking or preparing it, but all in all it was an interesting experience. "
"Fresh, but pricey","Worth the experience. Take exit 7 from the metro then take a right under the tunnel full of fresh veggies. The indoor seafood market is cleaner and simple to navigate. There will be english speaking guides, or yellow shirts, who can translate for the seller. They will also direct you to the 2nd floor to the restaurant.It will be a little pricey, since the fishmonger has their own set prices which you may choose to negotiate. Additionally, the upstairs restaurants will charge their standard prices. Cass goes so well with the food though.I lived in Seoul for a year before coming here, and I can say this place is not very tourist-y compared to some of the other attractions the city offers. "
State of the Art Modern Wholesale Fish Market,"A completely new (and some may say sanitised) fish market has been created covering an immense site and over several floorsThe ground floor areas concerned with the preparation, display and sale of dead and live products. There is a cornucopia of sea food on offer - very colourful very interesting and to me - many of the products unrecognisableUpper floors are devoted to offices, shops and many small independent restaurantsNot an obvious tourist attraction - but for anyone with an interest in food it is a mustThe market is within easy walking distance of Noryangjin Metro Station (Lines 1 and 9)"
Good experience,"There was an old and a new fish market. Went to both and opted to buy seafood at the old one. We just followed our guts and purchase our fresh seafood. After that, we were led to a restaurant and they prepared the food. It was a good experience especially with the live octopus (sanakji)."
"LIVE octopus, Fresh fish market but touristy",TRY THE LIVE OCTOPUS. Fresh Seafood but a lot of the fishmonger will hassle you and ask you to go to their restaurant upstairs. ITs kind of hard to bargain unless you know the market price of the seafood. Nonetheless its a good experience. 
DIY style is the best,"Ignore your runners (people in yellow/ blue vests that befriend you while you buy seafood) and find a good restaurant yourself. Make sure you read these reviews and know what you're doing (even if you don't). We went to a new restaurant (I'll leave a picture down) which charged us relatively cheap per kg. We were satisfied and happy with the experience! Make sure you count your fishy blessings (price!) before you sit down. Go to the locals, trust me on this :) "
Fish Market ain't gonna smell like perfume,"I was hesitant to come here after reading all the negative reviews here on TripAdvisor.After experiencing it ourselves, it really was nowhere near as bad as all the complaints here.I mean, sure it smell like fish, after all it is a fish market, of course it's not going to smell like perfume.We had a local food tour guide who knows her way around and we had one of the best seafood we ever had here.The live octopus dipped in sesame oil and salt was great, also the steam giant crab was fantastic.Basically everything we had here was great, even the kimchi side was so tasty.The vendor here mostly don't speak english but some able to speak mandarin due to the many chinese tourist who likes to come here.I would recommend to travel here with a local korean or a specialty food tour guide to make your experience more comfortable.There were two separate market at the time we came, the new one and the old one. The newer building seems cleaner and nicer, but I honestly think they are not that much different."
Unique experience of seafood ,"Visited this fish market with my teenage daughter, who wanted to come and try our the live octopus. We ordered salmon sashimi and 2 live octopuses from the market stalls selling the food. Then bring the food to a nearby restaurant for preparation. The restaurant gives us condiments and sauces to eat with the sashimi. It's certainly tasty! "
Visited the new wing of the market ,"I came here once before the new wing is built. After reading the reviews from Trip advisor about the new wing, we decide to explore this. The new wing is further up the old wing of the market. Once you walk through the old market, you will see a new painted building( 2 storey tall). When we are there, not all the stalls are occupied. I guessed some of the old wing stalls have not moved to the nee wing of the seafood market. We decided to follow the Local Korean crowd. Though it was a Sunday afternoon, many locals are here to buy their seafood. We walked towards where most of them are congregated and start checking out the live seafood. There are no pricing listed on the seafood tank. So the best way is to dish out your calculator and start asking The price and punching the numbers. For those whom are new to this manner of ordering. Please note. 1. Order your fresh seafood from the stall at level 1/ basement. 2. If you want to have it cook and eat on the spot, the restaurants are on the second floor. The pricing for cooking is another additional cost. Some of it does by the weight. You may ask them to lower the cost of the dish is simple to cook. Example. We order the abalone and wanted it cook as porridge. The abalone is the cost we paid to the live seafood stall by kg. We also have to pay the Restuarant for the cooking cost - it comes out to 5000won per kg. 3. Other miscellaneous cost are the towels, small dishes and drink. There will be a runner that will bring you and your seafood to the Restuarant designated. I love my seafood steam, boiled and grilled. So I didn't make it complicated. As the runner is from China, we spoke in Mandarin and he gave the precise ways on how our seafood are cooked. We ordered the crab, large cockles and abalones We have very enjoyable meal there as our Neighbour diner whom are Korean were sharing their sashimi with us and trying to communicate with us in his simple English. I recommend only those who love seafood to visit this place. Just not be frustrated but do some simple calculation before you confirm your order in bulk. "
Tourists are bound to get extorted here,"The fish market is pretty huge, with all of the stalls selling close to the same items. It is difficult to decide who to purchase from so make sure you take your time surveying before deciding. We made the mistake of not doing that and just buying from a random ahjumma. She had promised to sell us an octopus + a slab of salmon for 24,000w but however after catching the octopus, she changed it to 29,000w. We refused but she just got angry and shoved the octopus at us then proceeded to tell us to pay and leave. While my friend and I were discussing on what to do, she rudely told us to speak in mandarin (she could speak in korean and mandarin). The both of us decided to go with it because we didn't want to create a scene. So then this other ahjumma brought us to her restaurant in the 2nd floor. All she did was to provide us some cutleries, sauces, kimchi and cut our octopus for us. We were charged 10,000w for that. Definitely the most unpleasant dining experience we had in Korea. However the salmon and octopus were really fresh so that is worth noting. If you visit, be careful!!"
poor seafood experience,"this fish market is consist of a sea of fish mongers who will sell you live seafood and then a runner will bring the seafood for you to restaurants nearby for further processing/cooking (which comes at additional cost e.g. soup 10k won; grill 5k won; steam 5k won etc). due to the intense competition (most fish mongers have similar products), they will try their best to pull you and get your attention as you walk down the aisle, making it a very unpleasant experience for me. I observed that price of similar seafood is different among the fish mongers and hence suspected that some will mark up the price considerably to take advantage of the tourists. haggle is compulsory (which only makes the experience worse for me)the seafood restaurant we were brought into was sub-par. we had flounder fish (soup + sashimi), abalone (grilled + sashimi) and grilled scallop. apart from the fish soup (which were also average), the rest were prepared crudely (e.g. can find bone in the sashimi) and taste bland.considering the double pricing system and potential marking up of this place, i wouldn't consider the seafood cheap also.perhaps a ""must-visit"" for first-time tourist for its unique experience but i did not enjoy mine"
Very Cool,"Tons of stalls with all kinds of fish. A good portion of the fish and shellfish are alive in tanks...Clams, anilines, snapper, flounder, tilapia, octipus, crab, lobster, eel to name some. Huge prawns. You can buy it and get it cooked upstairs. We don't speak Korean so this may be easier said than done. But if you want fresh seafood...this is the place to go!!!"
'Indoor ocean' for fresh seafood,"Took the subway line to Noryangjin Fish Market, very easy to located this place if you are taking the public Seoul Subway. Walking in to this indoor fish market like walking in to a 'indoor ocean', many types of fresh seafood from alantic ocean to pacific ocean water. Of course we are not able to communicate well with the vendor there, but if you do speak Mandarin, they are few vendor do speak Mandarin and it will help with your seafood bargaing process. Like usual, you can pick the seafood and get it weight for the price, if you are happy just pay it, or you love the bargain.. enjoy it. Then, if you want to have your seafood there, the vendor will help you to carry it up to the selected restaurant. The restuarant will choose the best way to make the seafood as taste as original from sashimi way to steamed or cook it according to your choice. You have to pay for it, not really expensive as most of the cooking is just simple steamed. You can also buy the seafood home and cook it at home.Most tourist misunderstood the whole buying and eating in the restaurant procedure.Step 1: You pick, weight and agree the price then you pay (no cooking charge incl)Step 2: If you want to seafood to me cook by the restaurant, the vendor will help you to bring it to the restaurant or you bring it homeStep 3: You want the restaurant to cook it, of course you have to pay for it. You can ask for the price first if you worry if is a scam, but I personally find it ok. Enjoy your fresh seafood !"
Fresh seafood at reasonable price ,"Fresh seafood at reasonable price . We picked our sole fish, shells, octopus, and fresh abalone (!) And then we eat them at a restaurant upstairs. The sole fish wqs eaten raw like sashimi. The rest were put into a hot boiling soup. WOW. Everything tastes really good but it was really The abalone that absolutely made an impression . "
"Cool market, but tricky if you want to eat here","There is soooo much fresh seafood at the market. It is a large market. As a tourist, chances are, you aren't going to buy seafood to take home or cook yourself. There are several restaurants that you can buy seafood at the market and they will cook it for you. The only problem is choosing the right restaurant. Be careful of the different charges for cooking. Most the restaurants charge the same. The hard part is figuring out which one will cook it best. We chose wrong, but I'm sure there are some good restaurants upstairs in the market. I think there were about 20 to choose from. For me it was just fun to see the market."
Fresh seafood and new building compare to few years ago,"You can enjoy to buy the seafood and cook at the 2nd floor of local restaurant. Not cheap to cook compare with the seafood because it is simple cook or fresh to eat. If you compare BBQ beef or pork, it is cheaper and worth to eat, King Crab, Octopus, sea ​​urchin...etc Very delicious"
"Lots of fresh seafood, King crab is the star","Went to Noryangjin Fish market for lunch. My first impression was there are a lot of stalls selling the same stuff and can get pushy at times. Had a problem deciding which to go for to choose the seafood to eat. Anyway after randomly selecting a seller she got what we wanted, a king crab, scallops and prawns for the 2 of us. After weighing price was 68000 krw. Brought us up a floor to the restaurant to cook and after we agreed in the style of cooking we waited patiently for the food. Very simple style, steamed and bbq, plus a fried rice at the end with what's left of the king crab. Damage was another 48000 which we though was high given the little work and ingredients added. Ok, the crab was very good, fresh and sweet so at the end of the day, it was worth it. Would I go again...Yes for the king crab."
Excellent variety but beware!,"Live King crabs, lobsters, uni and more. Perfect for buying to cook it yourself but do not eat it there! They will charge various fees for cooking/seating and even after you agreed on a price, they will ask for extra fees. Also they simply don't know how to cook the foods; tough overcooked meat. We went 2 times to different restaurants and got cheated both times - even the lobster tail mysteriously disappeared and they insisted all the meat was served already, to top it off an extra $30 for.. boiling it."
"New venue, cheap seafood","Perhaps it was the time we went weekday just before lunch but there was not as many stalls opened. This was a new building and very clean for a wet market, all the restaurant are upstairs and usually the stalls you buy from will take you to their affiliated one. Food wasn't so great for young children since they can't take sashimi and spicy food. But the fresh sea urchin tasted so heavenly compared to the ones in Singapore."
visit the old and the new,It’s a 5 minute walk from the metro We toured the old and the newThe new is definitely more cleanEvery stall holder wants you sell you something. Its Ok Its just like every other market in Asia.My wife wanted something special it was our anniversary so we chose king crab. It was around 2 kilos and cost won 50k with won 20k for cookingWe followed a runner upstairs to a small very clean restaurant area where the crab was cooked beautifully. I don’t complain about the price. I just let you know about my great seafood experienceI will recommend to all my friends to visit this market for the experience
Smelly fish market ,Old and dirty fish market. Was in 10 minutes ready. Hard sell market place owners. Not particularly worth the visit. The signs to the market was odd. You have to take the higher bridge to get there. During the afternoon most of the stalls were closed. 
Double the price if you are not speaking korean,"I bought some seafood and ask them to cook for me. I was in the older building. The seafood are very fresh but the way they prepare is not perfect. They over cooked my abalone and scallop. However, it still a very good experience. Tonight I walk into one of the local supermarket, I can get the same for half the price. I think that why they do not displace the price. I suggest you should bring a Korean friend with you to get better deal. I spent 30k won for the food, 18k for the preparation."
the best place to try Sannakji,"We buy 2 octopus for 10K won, 1 king crab for 20K won and 1 big plate salmon sahimi for 20K won. Thats worthed!Nice fish market."
A bit intimidating,"It's a cool experience to walk around and choose fresh seafood, but all the sellers are quite aggressive and come up very close to try and get you to buy their stock. to the point where we were too scared to stop and actually look at anything closely because they were so pushy. There are two parts, one in the older more traditional fish market type and the other side is newer and looks slightly cleaner. I went with a local friend, and even she wasn't so happy with the experience. I don't know what I would have done without a local, but somehow we managed to order something and ate at the restaurant side, which is a bit of a walk away."
A bad experience ,"Finding this place was hard.The place is dirty, staff not friendly .If you kana stop by n watch ,they staff that speak Chinese will persuade you to buy their seafood and say lots of things just to hook you .They can cook the seafood that you picked for you ,let you sit in a comfortable .Price of seafood you pay first.Cook different pay separately Per person charges In the end pay a lot ...eat nothing .Not worth it ."
Just a good experience ,"Was there in early June 16 and they're expanding to a large more modern building next door but activity at the original is still very much there. Group of three and wandered for a while and settled on the live octopus with large sashimi platter from a vendor. The octopus was wrapped in a bag with sea water and we were escorted to a small restaurant where the octopus was chopped up and the huge sashimi platter was delivered. Not cheap but not really expensive. From our picked vendor had choices of 30-40-50,000 won sashimi platters and we took the most expensive because we were givin a bonus plate with more fish and sea creatures. All said and done about 60,000 won (~$50 USD) for an incredible amount of fresh fish. Finished it all, luckily my korean friend is a competitive eater :)"
Not a huge market but still worth it,Am sitting at one of their restaurants upstairs and eating the fresh fish I just purchased downstairs. does not get much better as an experience for a foodie.the market is easily accessed by subway and a short walk from the station.it's definitely not as impressive as Tsukiji or Sydney fish markets.The sashimi was fantastic and waiting for my lobster to be cooked.good use of my free afternoon between meetings.
Great king crab ,"This place is very cool and definitely a must-see in Seoul. We went on a Tuesday for lunch and it was almost empty. First, figure out what you want - we wanted king crab. Walk around and get prices from a few different vendors and figure out who has the lowest. Once we had a vendor picked out, we negotiated and got out crab for about $50 bucks. Then you go upstairs and find a restaurant and they will steam it for you. We also negotiated up there - just ask a few places for prices and see who is the cheapest. Overall, fun experience and the King crab was amazing! "
Save your money on a proper restaurant,"There is a new building new to the market, some of the staffs said they are about to move-in but still under some touch-up. We have been searching in the old market for 30mins, bargain is only for one lost cost fish but not like big crab and lobster. You may be able to spend the same money if you are dinning in a proper restaurant or even hotel."
Repeat visit,"This is the second time we are at Noryangjin Fish Market. We had been visiting the older one and decided to try the new block. The seafood is still good and my son loves the abalone. Tried the sea urchin this time, 2 for 10000 won. They were fresh and sweet. The seafood sellers usually don't speak other language but there are runners who do speak mandarin and English to support them as well as leading the customers to the restaurants to cook the seafood purchase. The preparation rates are stated for the different ways in the restaurant or can always check."
Huge Fish Markets,"it was quite confusing as this was our first time, you basically choose your seafood someone helped us choose and translate and lead us to upstairs to a restaurant and they cook it but you have to pay a fee for it. "
"A must, only if you love seafood","The market is now in its third location over the years -- this latest iteration is new, spacious, sanitary, and (until Noryangjin Station finishes its renovations) a bit hard-to-find. Some sidewalk stickers guided us the roundabout route. The old decrepit buildings are apparent nearby. The new version is a bit sanitized--not much worry about getting dirty at all. When we went, Thursday lunchtime, it seemed rather empty. But the variety and freshness of seafood is apparent, really a good place for a seafood lover. Lots of restaurants upstairs will cook your fish to taste; in a slow period (as with us), they may even take pity on a clueless foreigner and walk down with you to the stalls and help you order your king crab and octopus and anything else. The crab was expensive but stunning (YOLO). The raw octopus is indeed weird but palatable--literally sticks to the roof of your mouth! Note: if anybody in the group does not like seafood or the sight of fish being gutted, go somewhere else that day. Note also that there's not much English spoken, but they are very friendly and helpful. I wish the government would spend some effort on tourism support there."
Affordable seafood,"Went with my family of 6, and we had/ price in k'KRW: 1 king crab weighing 2kg+ (Russian or Alaskan I do not know)/ 70k, 4 abalones/ 10k, 1 halibut /60k (forgot the weight), 3 or 4 small octopuses/ 10k. Paid a restaurant a charge of 56k for preparation of food; steamed the crab, had half the halibut raw and the other half in soup, barbequed the abalones and had the octopuses raw. When we went into the market, we were followed by a chinese-speaking man who tried to ""help"" recommend us the seafood. Found him bothersome after awhile so went up to the 2nd floor to look around and to choose our own place. Plenty of restaurant runners around, don't think they are trying to rip you off, just there to earn a commission. Just ignore them if you don't like it, I did. Good prices, especially when compared to where I came from. The vendors will throw in some freebies as well (I got some salmon sashimi when I bought the halibut)"
Amazing experience,"Visited this market to get some good and cheap seafood. The variety is astonishing - all kinds of clams, sea urchins, fish, crabs, shellfish, etc. The sea urchin was a disappointment as it wasn't as fresh or tasty as what we had in Taipei or Tokyo, but the Alaskan king crab was amazing - just simply steamed and the sweetness in the flesh was to die for."
Fish market,Amazing place where you can find all sort of fish and everything the sea can offer. If you want you can taste the fish for very little money. A must
Best King crab and priceless experience!,"The 4 of us visited Noryangjin market via subway. We are seafood lovers. Signage in subway pointed us to the stairs and walkway bridge to the market. Reviews on trip advisor helped us to know the going rate for the King crab. Vendors offered us 60,000 to 35,000 won per kilo (2.2 lbs) for king crab. We went to 6 vendors before heading back to stall #84 which was the 35,000 won price and the nicest lady. Our crab was 2.4 kilos at 80,000 won. We also bought large abalone at 2 for 10,000 won. We were taken to a restaurant outside the market after finding that all the upstairs restaurants were closed. We went on a Sunday morning. Best King crab all Of us have eaten, as it was fresh and in season! So sweet and easily shelled! We paid 28,000 won for the restaurant to cook the food and with side dishes. Restaurant was clean, and efficient. Our meal was less than 30$ U.S. Per person. Fabulous meal and one of a kind experience was totally worth it...Priceless! Will surely recommend this experience to seafood lovers! "
Ripped off,"We actually got our seafood from the first few stores and got brought to a small stall which prepares for us. The preparation cost USD80 and it wasn't any cheaper. If you really want to try, do walk further down much much more as my friend didn't have to pay any preparation cost at all the previous time."
Fresh Breakfast/ Brunch,"Interesting place though less rowdy than Tokyo's Tsukiji Fish Market. We chose a lobster, crab and sea urchin for only 54,000w. The stall vendor whisked us away to a nearby restaurant that helped us prepare the freshest seafood ever! "
Must see,"It's a cool place to walk through. Hard to purchase without translator, we got lobster and crab and had them cooked upstairs."
amazing!,"This is a huge market with many stands selling fresh and mostly alive fish of any kinds, crabs, shrimps, shells and more.You can buy your fish, ask them to make a sashimi, and bring it to one of the many restaurants that are in the upper floor, where it will be cooked and served. Fish is not cheap, however freshness and variety justify the cost."
Not worth the trip if you don't speak Korean or Mandarin,"It's a big market where a lot of vendors are selling quite a few but limited types of seafood. However, if you have been to other fish markets around the world or any big wet market, you will be disappointed with this market.1) it's really hard to find it from the train station, and there's nothing else to visit near the fish market;2) it's too old and dirty to be a tourist destination;3) the worst part is the communication: if you don't speak Korean, you even cannot ask/confirm the name of the seafood, negotiate the price or ask around to know the fair price. The aunties there speak zero English and are not very good at using body language or other tools to communicate. I got my seafood from a Mandarin-speaking auntie. I knew I got ripped-off, but there are not many aunties who can speak Mandarin, so I didn't have a choice.4) the octopus sashimi wasn't good or special either. I still prefer the Japanese wasabi octopus.5) when we brought the seafood to cook in a restaurant, we faced the communication issue again. We couldn't even describe how we wanted the seafood to be cooked. They didn't provide menu/pictures either. "
Overwhelming. Find a local to help you,"An amazing collection of seafood stalls under one roof. Fresh fish and shellfish as well as iced. The procedure is this:1) bring friends if you are eating at the market2) find a local person to help you. Most Koreans will be more than happy to assist you3) decide on fresh or iced. Iced fish is great for soup or barbecue and much cheaper than fresh. 4) order about 1kg per person for shellfish for soup. Remember, your eyes are bigger than your stomach. 5) negotiate and make the purchase. Take the fish to the second floor of the new building next door. The table fees are about 3000 and the cooking charge about 10000-20000 depending on how much fish and whether it's soup of just steaming. "
Hard to eat by yourself ,"I'm glad I went to see this fish market. Unfortunately, I speak little to no Korean so I really couldn't communicate with vendors. And the ones I did communicate with were very nice. I would have loved to have purchased and eaten the fish but it was too much for one person to consume. Best to go in a group to enjoy fresh fish. I took line 9 exit 7. "
Visit when you have the time ,"Went there for the first time , heard good reviews from friends . There's many stores selling seafood. To Ensure your seafood is fresh , do only order the live seafood and those seasonal seafood which the prices are cheaper .Do not order those frozen prawns , clams , as these aren't fresh at all , and we didn't finish those seafood , very disappointing . Do bargain hard too , and ask many stores for prices quotation first before deciding . For the cooking , we had to pay 3000 won for the table service . On top of this , we order fish , abalone , prawn , all these individually dishes are charged separately . There's more charges depending on the type of seafood . The crab is in season now , do order the crab . Is this a must visit ? Compared to the Tokyo fish market , I still prefer the Tokyo fish market which is more authentic. This market is filled with many Chinese stalls and prices quoted for some stalls are extortion. "
"Wow-Fish, and lots of them.","An interesting place. In the process of moving into a new building that is a little more clean and hygienic looking, but take time to walk through the old market. A little Squeamish for those not used to, or willing to accept that this is about providing food and not a home fish tank for gold fish!Some fish were upside down and not swimming any more, but the overall feeling is that things are fresh as they are alive. Great topic for discussion with children about the food chain, and the spider crabs trying to escape.One of those places where you come away not really knowing how to feel, but also gives some insights into how people live and work in this environment and the surrounding street stalls of vegetables and more fish, but dried this time. A good hour spent."
Just a fish market,"If you want to see how fish are auctioned off, come here early in the morning, about 5:30-6am. Other times, you can buy some seafood and someone will offer to go cook it for you (at a price) and you'll be able to eat at a restaurant close by. If you want fresh seafood, this is the place to have a large variety. It's cool to check it out, but other markets in Seoul offer the same experience. Unless you're buying a whole fish i'd suggest you look elsewhere. It's nice to walk through the market though."
Interesting place but many restaurants are closed.,"This is my second time going to the place. But sadly, the place is not as memorable as it was before. Main reason : many restaurants situated close to the market are not in operation. I heard it was due to any ongoing protest. So, we had not much choice for eating place. We ended up eating a a makeshift hawker place. The seafood is fresh of course (given that we selected them from the adjacent seafood market) But the food was hastily prepared and not as delicious as I remembered. :-(For those who have not been there before, be prepared to walk. The place is HUGE! the size of many football fields. Not for the faint hearted. "
Huge and amazing with tons of seafood,Quite pricey for some items but overall worth it. Great place to try some Korean delicacies. Moving baby octopus and penis fish or worms. You choose what you want to call it. Wet area so leave your nice shoes at the hotel. From Myeongdong to the market costs less than $10 usd. Much less of a hassle vs going through the subway.
Brand new building (Same old seafood?),"There are two parts to the market: The old building which is full of back-to-back stores of swimming fish, shrimp on ice, and all sorts of sea oddities that are edible; and the new building which has some stores sectioned off by units and escalators up to a second floor. Turns out that the new building is so new that the restaurants on the second floor were still being built when I got there! There are *some* open ones at 10:30am but the rest were either in construction or were prepping. Just a rough few tips: Technically Korean raw fish is called 'hueh' or 'hwe', but the shopkeepers are calling it 'sashimi' so we get it. Try the weird things if you dare, but at least go for the fish. Bargaining is okay, but good luck as these store keepers are hardy."
Super fresh seafood!,"Very interesting place. We chose a swimming halibut, some top shells, scallops and sea urchin. The sea urchin was nothing much to shout about. The halibut was a beauty and we had it grilled, as sashimi and the bones and head were made into a spicy soup. Absolutely delicious."
"Pick the LOBSTER YA WANNA eat, get it perfectly steamed -Juicy, lots of meat & so sweet","We bought a whole lobster & snow crab in the concrete building of the Noryanjin fish market, even though there are 3 buildings that make up the market. We found the concrete building setting the newest and cleanest of the 3. We found a vendor selling lobster & crab, pointed to each type & asked how much. They charged 120,000. Korean won which is $101. BEFORE we made our seafood purchase, we asked where we could get it cooked for our lunch. They walked us over to another building closeby with people seated inside at low tables. They all had rice, Kim Chee & were eating seafood. Apparently after purchasing your seafood, you take it there & they steam it & bring it to your table. So we bought our seafood which turned out to be a kilo or 2.2# EACH of lobster & crab!! You pay the restaurant after you eat, for cooking your seafood, rice, water & Kim chee.MMMMMM It arrived steaming hot, simply placed in a huge aluminum pan cooked to bright orange perfection. They gave us 2 pairs of scissors, rice bowls, water & Kim chee. We LOVED it...so much fun & good eats........the lobster was the best...SOOOO MUCH MEAT...not just a small tail or teeny claws, HANDFULS of lobster! We left wth full tummies & intentions to return on our next trip!"
New experience to meet locals and eat their food,"Noryangin is one of the Korea's largest seafood market.We can buy various fresh seafood in the first floor. We can ask the seller to slice the fish for eating as a sashimi.At that time, we only bought the fish and went to the restaurant on the 2nd floor. We requested the restaurant to make fish stew for us and we need to pay 19,000 won for 3 person. It's quite pricey, but it's tasted good"
Better if you know Korean,"Was an ok experience, but would not come back again. Would have been better if we knew someone Korean to show us around and help haggle lol. Kind of knew we were being overpriced since we were tourists. Being Vietnamese, we were automatically thought of as Chinese tourists, and by the reactions of the people around us, I guess we were given a different (poorer) service at the restaurant after buying our fish."
A Total Experieince,This huge seafood market is a mind blowing world Every imaginable creature from the sea can be found in dozens of booths. They are alive and they are dead but they are all fascinating. You have never seen anything like it before and it will make you appreciate your fish dish at a restaurant.
Interesting! ,"We first walked into the newer looking building.... But it's the warehouse building that you want to go to. There is a ton of seafood in there but after walking several aisles, they will all start looking the same... We ended up buying a snow crab. It cost us $45,000 won. I think we got ""touristed""... The fish sellers speak a little English and some mandarin. Here's the thing... The price per kilogram is not listed for the crabs so I feel like it's whatever they say it is particularly since we don't speak or read Korean! This would be an excellent place to come with a Korean speaking person... Anyways, we took our crab to a restaurant on the first floor where part of the dining area is in an alley... It's a bit dirty.. Okay... A lot dirty ... We asked that our crab be steamed... The crab was sweet but way over cooked... They charged us a $5,000 won service fee... This is quite an experience... But never again unless I'm there with a Korean speaking person. I think I could have done a much better job steaming the crab! "
Visit with a local friend if possible ,"Came here w/korean friends, sought out a fish that we liked, got that fish executed and turned into sashimi quite fast right in front of our eyes and went upstairs to eat it like the locals do. Cool atmosphere, plenty to see and eat. I recommend tagging along with someone who speaks korean.. or at least learn how to speak ""shopping""korean before you visit. "
"A bit disappointing, very difficult to find","Let me preface with the fact I have been to Tsukiji fish market in Japan so I have high expectations. Finding this place was a real challenge. There was very little signage at all when you get off the subway, and the one sign at exit 7 does not lead you right there. My advice would be to exit gate 7 turn right immediately and walk 500ft or so and there will be an alley and make a U turn down the under the train tracks. When you get to the other side you will notice a huge modern looking building. That appears to be the new fish market as I walked in there and it was practically empty with just a few fishmongers. Instead turn right immediately once you come out of the tunnel and straight ahead will be the market. The fish selection was interesting and there was definitely some cool looking fish not available stateside. However the market itself was nothing special in my opinion and the prices were high. My advice would be that if your are in the neighborhood and have never been to a wet fish market then by all means check it out, otherwise don't go out of your way to see it."
Fresh Glossy fish,I had to visit this place even though I had no inclination to buy anything as I was staying at a hotel. The market is 300 metres from the metro station of the same name. A great place to cure your curiosity of fish markets. Does not smell bad at all. Fresh fried fish available to all who want a bite!....without fishing!
Beware what you buy .,"A friend recommended we visit. You can buy some fresh seafood and they can bring you to a restaurant in which they will prepare the seafood for your consumption. I would suggest you check what season it is for which seafood. Or safest to buy something that you see at every stall as that is probably the season. We bought some clams, and although they were in water, they are not fresh. Bought some urchin, only one stall sells them, and we left that whole bunch alone as it looms rotten. The person who prepare the food said if the clams were cooked, it's ok to eat. But if eaten raw , we will sure get tummy aches as they were not fresh! If you want to be very safe, just buy a crab or a live fish. "
The best fish market ever,"Got here by invitation of my Regional Managing Director while we have a meeting back in our Headquarter in Seoul. He invite me to have the best seafood ever.And it happen to be the best seafood ever I've ever had.Don't expect this place is a fancy and clean market. This fish market is really a market. There will be puddles everywhere.But it is a heaven for seafood lovers. They provide hundred types fish, crabs, prawns, squids, etcAnd down stair on the basement, you may find one restaurant to cook over the fish you already picked upstairs. So it is really FRESH.This place is worth to visit. It is about 30 minutes from Jamsil area, by taxi. There might be some traffic density during peak hours and weekend dinner."
For seafood lover,"My friend and I really love seafood so, we wanted to visit the fish market and have fresh seafood. The market is quite easy to get to. Just take subway Line 9 to Norayngjin station, walk up to the exit and to the overpass. I actually could smell grilled fish from there. From the overpass, there was a sign that point to the right and to fish market. Once across, turn left and go down the stair. On the second floor balcony, you can see all the market areas with stalls full of seafood.Down stair, we browsed around to see what they had to offer. The variety of the seafood was incredible. There were so many things that we had never seen before or didn't realize that they were edible.There was only two of us so, we couldn't have many dishes. We settled with fresh oyster, assorted fish sashimi and grilled fish. We bought oyster and sashimi from one stall and fresh whole fish from another stall. Then, the stall owner had his staff took us to a restaurant (more like a cooking tent) along the side of the market. There, they prepared food for us and we ate there. We paid them for the service and beverage. The seafood was really fresh and delicious. Try having sashimi and oyster with Korean chilli sauce. It was delicious!"
Fresh seafood,"This is a working market and while it may not be a pleasant tourist place, don't be turned off. Yes the floors are wet and dirty, and the seafood may not be the cheap. But it's fresh and once you've picked what you like, there are little restaurants that can cook it the way you want (grilled, BBQ, steamed etc). We paid 98000 wons for an Alaskan king crab (1.7kg), 10000 wons for 4 small abalones and 10000 for 5 fresh scallops. We paid the restaurant 33000 wons to have everything prepared and cooked. It was fresh and yummy so don't be put off by what you initially see (like I did)"
Seafood galore,"I was really impressed by the range and variety of seafood at the wholesale market. They're not only fresh but also cheap too. However the downside is that the restaurants actually charge quite an amount of fee to cook your seafood selections. A must-try would be sea urchins and abalone, which tasted really, really sweet and fresh!The wholesale market is located within a walking distance from Noryangjin station."
Impressive,"Really impressive arriving by subway to this fabulous market.You don't have to speak Korean, international languages work !They speak a bit English and Mandarin.Food is fresh and it is so typical !"
Poor Signage and Bring Boots!,"This is a working fish market - I enjoyed seeing it. I hope folks from the city of Seoul tourism read this post. The signage for tourists is terrible. First, they changed the subway exit - most guides will tell you to exit 1, but that doesn't exist - its now exit 7. When you get out of the exit, there is no signage whatsoever and it's not at all obv - ious what to do. Most people said (in posts, and hotel concierge) - as soon as you get out of subway you'll see it. Maybe in the old exit, but definitely not in the new exit. There are subway signs pointing to the fish market it's just once you get outside the signs end.So....go straight out of exit 7 and go for a good 100 meters and you'll see an entrance to a plywood tunnel. Here you will see a fish market sign - Turn right (like a u-turn sort of) into the tunnel and walk for a ways and then keep going straight and you'll see the fish market ahead of you.It's WET inside (also wish my hotel concierge would have mentioned that) - expect your shoes to get wet and smell like fish ! Most workers in their are wearing big rubber boots. There are places with puddles at least 1-2 inches deep - so watch where you're walking.I got lost getting out - i saw one sign that said subway and followed it but then saw no other signs and couldn't figure out where I came in (it's a big place). Pay attention to where you come in so you can figure your way back. I'd say leave bread crumbs, but the fish would probably eat them.Other than that - it's cool to see all the fish and I'm glad I went. I just wish there could have been a little better postings of signage."
"Interesting, but not cheap","Huge market, fresh products (but not everything). We can find lots of differents seafood, you can buy and ask them to cook for you but the service charge is not cheap. Have to try once if you visit Seoul. "
Fun and good sashimi ,"Very easy access as it is almost part of the Noryangjin subway station ( just crossed a bridge). The kids had lots of fun looking at all fish and seafood. We got a two big plates of fresh sashimi for 25,000 won for home but you can also eat there in a restaurant."
Live octopus!!!,"Second time visiting this place, amazed one more time. The prices of this place are not cheap (maybe because we are foreigners they over priced) but the quality of the food is good and you are totally sure is fresh. Hundreds of shops to choose from shrimps until puffer fish (yes!puffer fish and they have specialized chef to cook it). The must is the octopus sashimi (live octopus... well choped octopus that still moving). No need to visit early morning, all the fish are alive so anytime you go the product will be fresh. Amazing place to live the experience and enjoy a tasty lunch."
Definitely worth visiting,"Amazing place. Hundreds of shops, all selling fish of course. Many boast incredible aquariums containg live fish, squid, u name it. Lots of sea food as well. I liked it very much."
Magnificent and value seafood,"There are lots of stalls selling fresh seafood in the market despite the poor environment. The foods are delicious, i especially recommend the king crab which costs around 120000 won for a several kg crab. Even if steamed without any seasoning, its meat is scrumptious, juicy and just perfect. You should definitely visit there by metro station Noryangjin (Line 1,9)"
Huge choice of fresh seafood - freshly made for you,"One of the best seafood you can get. Not cheap, feels a bit strange to point your finger on the things you want to eat....but tastes so good!"
Exciting atmosphere and fresh seafood!,"We went in the morning when there was a lot of hustle and bustle. The stalls all had excellent ware, some focusing on shellfish and others focusing on fish. The fishmongers tend to give a higher price to tourists however it appeared they were waiting to haggle so we did. Really great visit and such a fun experience to eat the live octopus."
Worth visit but expensive,Lots of stalls selling mostly the same food. Jus choose which ever stall u like. Food is fresh but quite expensive.
"Come in the evening, less crowd","We went late evening, around 6, all the kiosks were still open and the seafood still fresh. We got a big plate of sashimi, cost us around W60,000, and we ate at nearby restaurant , at the end we need to pay for a drink and a big bowl of fish soup, cost us another W30,000. This place worth a visit, although some of the shopkeepers a bit pushy but I think they are not going to overly charge you, just ask them to give extra, more likely you will get."
Worth a trip.. I made two,Skeptical about eating here since there were a number of tourists complaining that they were overcharged. Thus extra homework was done prior to the visit.Had my price list as well as the items i wanted to eatOysters 12 for 5000wontiger prawns 15 for 10000wonBuy your choice seafood then go upstairs and pick your own restaurant. I prefer picking my own since some were saying the restaurant ppl gave commission to the 'touts' taking tourist to their place. Picked one with sufficient locals in there and confirmed the price before handing over my seafood3000won/pax and 5000won for eat item that requires cooking. Pretty reasonable. I also added the fish stew for 10000won. Soup was refillable.
From the fish market to institute.,"Noryangin in Seoul is well-known for three reasons first the fish market, then the institute, and last the street food. People here are divided into 2 categories.First, there people are visit the fish market. They eat or buy fresh seafood from the fish market. The fish market is a very big in Noryangin.The other people are the students. They are people from all over the country who come to Noryangin to study. There are many famous educational institutes in Noryangin. Their purpose for coming to Noryangin is to go to college and start their careers. People in Noryangin have little money. So many street food shops was born. Their food is delicious and cheap."
Best Discovery!!,"Absolutely love this place. Price point aside, I has the most amazing seafood here. Fresh and super sweet king crab, scallops etc It's definitely not cheap but I guess seafood is always on the pricier side and here you'll find it better priced that those you get in restaurants. "
Mini Tsukiji Fish Market,"Being an admirer of the Tsukiji Fish Market, had to go to Noryangjin. Easy to access via the Noryangjin Station (Line 1), just walk on the bridge going over the train tracks, and you are there. Great to use all your senses as you experience this vibrant market. Not much of an auction as Tsukiji, but more tourist friendly, easily walkable without getting run over by forklifts. Many hawkers who speak multiple languages, trying to sell you all sorts of seafood, the most popular being sashimi platters, live baby octopus, and king crab. Interesting to see a sale in progress, with price negotiations going back and forth, followed by not the fall of a gavel, but a pick to the head of the fish - once dead, you bought it. You will then bring your kill upstairs to a dozen or so restaurants who specialize in preparing the fresh seafood you just purchased downstairs.Really interesting experience and worth the trip."
Worth to go once,"It seems like a must-go place for seafood lovers, as there are so many choices there. Personally, it is worth to visit once and try the famous live octopus and king crab. The problem I have is the cost, which is quite high even after bargaining (well, I am not a good bargainer, I must admit). The place is not suitable for children, as too crowded and slippery."
Fresh seafood but....,"The seafood market had endless stalls of fresh seafood. We decided to give it a try and bought some live seafood from one of the stalls. The price was reasonable and we were taken to a restaurant outside next to the market. The cooking was bad because the restaurant just steam the food without any sauce. Even the seafood that was barbecue came back dry and was not marinated at all. We were totally disappointed with the cooking at this restaurant. To enjoy the live seafood in this market, it's better to go with a local who knows where to find the right restaurant to cook the seafood. "
Much better seafood and cooking quality in Japan and Taipei!,"We have went there for lunch, but we don't really enjoy the food there, I am not sure it is because of the freshness or the way they cook it, but I would recommend the fish market in Japan and Taipei over this one. Price is cheap and most of the people there speak Mandarin, but very little english."
As Fresh As It Gets. ,"This place is a blast to visit. Your dinner will be alive one minute, and on your plate (possibly still wriggling) the next. After negotiating the price of your fresh catch, head to one of the packed dungeon-like dining areas where the fish will be prepared for you. Best enjoyed alongside cold beer and sake with friends. Sashimi a must. "
Overrated destination ,"This place is completely not worth it. Compared to fish markets around the world with Japan the nearest this is nowhere. It is a straight tourist pitfall. The stalls keepers are not the owners, they are hired as sales people due to language reasons and to ofter you extremely low quality seafood (I'm comparing to what we can get in other markets) with a ridiculous price for foreigners.Well, yes the some of the seafood are alive (like fish and octopus) but there's nothing to shout about given that this is a common sight."
Worth a visit for experience ,"Alight at Noryangjin Station, use Exit 1 and walk straight (short distance) till you see an underpass on the right. Go through this underpass and turn right upon exit. Follow the crowd (or fishy smell) and you will arrive at this seafood heaven! Some prices fluctuate between stalls, so best to walk around and ask before selecting on one to buy your fresh seafood! Oysters seem to be sold at flat 5000won, while items like lobster could range between 25,000 to 50,000 per kg (depending on stall owner).Bring your purchases up to second floor and have a restaurant cook them eg steam. Had mine done for 7000won per item, 3000won per pax for table seat. Overall a nice experience if you ensure not to get ripped off ! "
Good place to visit when you are in Seoul,"I like this place as they are selling all the fresh seafood at reasonable( or cheap) price. After you get the seafoods you like, then you can go to the 2nd floor, any of the canteen/restaurant will help you cook it at cost of $7 per type."
"Eye-opening Experience, must-go if you love seafood","A must-go location for all seafood lovers, Noryangjin Fish Market offers the freshest seafood in Seoul. Completely different from Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo which mostly sells to wholesalers and restaurants, Noryangjin Fish Market caters more to consumers. Some stalls are also linked to restaurants upstairs which would whip up delicious dishes for you at a price, and the quality is outstanding.I was brought around by a couple Korean friends of mine, so language was not a barrier for them. However stall owners can also speak Mandarin if you wish to, but most of them can barely speak any English. Just remember to bargain!"
"Fish, fish, and more fish","If you're into seafood, this is a place to see. They have all types seafood. If you are going to buy anything its best if you know a little Korean. "
Fish market.,"It is simply the biggest fish market in Seoul. Getting off at the station, just follow your nose and follow the walkway across the tracks. Enter from the riod is easiest if you come by train.Inside you'll find a profusion if small stalls with an overwhelming selection of live, and otherwise, fish. If you wast to eat on location, it works like this: You choose your favorite fish and they will make sashimi directly in the front of you. You can of course take the sashimi home or, more interesting, take a receipt and go to a restaurant on the second floor of the fish market. They will charge you a bit of table fee and charge for the cooking, collect your fish and serve it. You xan also get a nice hot soup from the fish bones, in addition to the sashimi.All in all, a fun way to have a very koeean lunch! "
Must go!,"It's not hard to find. Go to the Noryangjin subway station and follow the signs. You walk on a sky bridge over the road to get there. You will be able to smell it when you get close to the building. Walk down the stairs until you reach ground level and there you are. Sea creatures as far as the eye can see. Shop keepers are really friendly, even to foreigners. They really try to entice you to buy. Don't know how well they understand English because as soon as they saw my boyfriend, they started talking to him in Mandarin. Wouldn't hurt to know the Korean word for what you plan to buy, but you could also just point. They'll show you the price on a calculator. A lot of things like fish, crab, and lobster are priced based on weight. Other things like shrimp have a fixed price. If you buy a lot from one place they are more likely to give you a discount or some extra stuff. If you buy fish they'll clean and cut it for you on the spot. The shop keepers are partnered with a restaurant nearby and they take you and everything you bought there to be cooked however you want it. We got some sort of black fish (boyfriend didn't know the English name for it) which we ate as sashimi. The head and the bones we had cooked as a soup. We also got our shrimp steamed. And you HAVE TO TRY the live octopus. Just do it. It's cheap and really not bad. They'll cut it up for you and you can take videos of it moving. I thought it was fun. All in all it's really fresh and really cheap seafood. Coming from America, the prices here at Noryangjin are a steal. Really worth the experience. They'll have any kind of seafood you can think of. Go! Go! Go!"
For the fishy experience ,"Not exactly an easy place to find.Buying the seafood is easy if you can speak Mandarin, most seafood stalls engage Chinese workers.Getting the resturant to cook the dishes for you is the challenging part.You need a local Korean to help you on this.I was hosted by local Korean friend, so that save me the headache. Be prepared to pay the price, being in ""market"" doesn't mean it is cheap. Firstly, there is the ingredient price from your seafood shopping, next there is the cooking price you pay the resturant to cook and serve you.Overall was a positive and interesting experience. "
Dishonest restaurant to avoid,"Do avoid the restaurant just outside the main building where all the fresh seafood stalls are. If you are walking from the subway station, you will walk through a underpass and once you are out of it, the restaurant lies on your right and beside it is a stall selling ready fried tempura.Today I bought my king crab at one of the seafood stalls along with some other seafood, paying 90,000 won for a 2 kg crab and paying additional for some other seafood. Then the fresh seafood stall had a staff who led me to the restaurant. It was damn ridiculous that when my crab was served, it was short of a pincer and the remaining crab was served in whole with the remaining pincer with 6 legs. When I confronted the restaurant staff, she claimed that the crab I brought over was already short of a pincer. This was not possible as I had personally selected the crab, saw it weighed, packed and brought it over to the restaurant. The huge pincer probably got 'tourist taxed' by one of the glutton kitchen staff for his lunch.Despite paying the 3000 won/pax for the base on top of the itemized cooking fee for each dish, I wasn't even served the usual Korean side dishes (eg. Kimchi and the other usual stuff) which I saw was served to the adjacent tables with local Korean guests.Worst of all, both my daughter and I had diarrhea after that. I am still experiencing colic as I write this review now. ;(Therefore, I would discourage any tourist from visiting the noryangjin fish market. But if you really still want to have a meal there, do make sure that you have a Korean speaking friend with you to minimize the risk of being taken for a ride."
off the beaten path,"not the usual tourist destination in seoul but would be a great adventure to those who are into fresh seafoods especially king crabs. go to noryangin subway station by either line 1 or 9. take exit one and walk about 100 meters. it was past seven pm when we arrived and the fish market was a bit quite. it took courage to walk pass by the sellers which i felt were a bit aggressive. we went up a building located on one side of the market and just followed some chinese tourists, as if we were part of their group. on the second floor are a series of restaurants and we went to one which looked a bit humble with a sign that says ""we serve to tourists."" we were quoted 60,000 kwn for one kilo of king crab. minimum of two kilos per order which represents the weight of one crab. so thinking it cheap, the two of us feasted on it. coming back home, i was able to read the reviews of the place and felt my stomach churning. wow, you guys were able to have king crabs for only 30,000 kwn!!! that is only half of what we paid : ("
Large retail fish market to get fresh seafood,"Unlike Tokyo Tsukiji fish market which only tends to wholesaler, Seoul Noryangjin fish market market tends to retailers. Noryangjin is a very large fish market that has all kinds of fresh seafood, from fish to shell fish to imported seafood from other countries like China. Sliced up fish for sashimi is available. However one can buy an entire fish and bring it to a restaurant on the upper floor for the restaurant to prepare the sashimi dish.The restaurant can prepare any type of seafood. Fish bones will be used for a soup broth.Live octopus is pretty gross since they still move even after being cut up.It is a place that must be visited in Seoul for seafood lovers."
Must Go! ,The biggest and oldest fish market that you must visit! Full variety of live seafood and you actually buy and send to 2nd floor's restaurant for immediate cook to enjoy the freshest seafood! I had a king crab and its finger licking good! Price per kilo I got is KRW 30k per kilo. Seriously I'm not sure if it cheap for being expensive.. anyway giving u a guide here. No regret and love it! 
Good place to see and eat seafood,"The fish market is huge. You can see a lot of different seafood which is not easily seen in other places, prawns as large as a lobster, and lobsters which are 2-3 times bigger than the lobsters commonly seen elsewhere, different kinds of shellfish etc. You can buy the seafood and the stalls are usually linked to small restaurants which would cook the seafood for you for a fee. Not extremely cheap but the seafood is really good and of course super fresh. If you can speak mandarin, there would be absolutely no problem communicating with the sellers. "
Rip Off Tourists,"It was very interesting to tour the market, to see a huge variety of live sea foods.However, please just enjoy the tour but DO NOT buy the seafood NOR eat at a restaurant upstairs. They just wanted to rip off tourists, and overcharged a lot.Please be warned."
went to the market to have fresh seafood,"Went there to have fresh seafood.a note to share with everybody, after paying for the seafood. the hidden cost is when you get them to cook for you. The market open as early as 5am, selling live and fresh seafood. from sashimi, to BBQ, Claypot and Deep fried. You name it, they serve it.They have wide selection of seafood to choose from, Clams, Crabs, Prawn, Fish, Live Octopus, Lobster and Sea Urchin. And many more..."
quite on the pricey side but worth a try,"We chose our food fresh from the market and paid a fee for cooking and staying at the nearby restaurant. We tried grilled fish, fish sashimi, live octopus, abalone, scallops and sea urchin! Total bill for 3 persons was KRW160,000.00"
