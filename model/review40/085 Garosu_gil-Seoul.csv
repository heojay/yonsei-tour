AMAZING boutique shopping!,"If you are interested in boutique, independent-designer shopping - this street is a must visit. I spent an entire afternoon here and could easily have gone for longer. Lots of cute primarily clothing and jewelry boutiques, lots of pop-up jewelry stands on the street. Also make sure you pop into all the side streets as well - Garosu-gil is the main thoroughfare, but there are a lot of shops and cafes as well on the side streets all the way down the block. Shops are open until late (~9-11 PM)"
High end unique shops!,"If you're looking for unique stuff, then visit this place.Pretty pricey area! This is where Korean local elite class go."
Interesting area to walk and shop,"The area was recommended by locals and indeed, it was interesting to walk around. We spotted many local singers. It was dominated by youngsters. We took a coffee and watched different kind of people walking around."
Love this place! Must GO,"Don't miss to have a cup of coffee at one of the many cafes, it's worth to chill for an evening apart from shopping around. "
place to shop and walk,famous and exquisite stores are lined up through Garosugil. You can enjoy window shop and walk the way thru after you have dinner
Hip & trendy shopping street,"Lots of plastic surgery clinics here. It's a hip and trendy shopping street. I came here to shop at Lapalette, but I couldn't find it. Overall, a nice neighbourhood and is less crowded compared to Myeongdong."
Great neighborhood ,"The area has several Korean, Asian, international and fusion restaurants. Nice selection of boutiques all with manicured windows displaying well- selected items. The area is pleasant to walk. Enjoy it!"
Trendy shopping street,i love this area. you can spend at least half day in Garosu-gil+Lots of cafes. +Not too crowded like Myeongdong+Lovely shops
Coffeeshops and clothing stores but chill overall,"After the streets of Myeongdong, Hongdae, Ewha and Gangnam I was very eager to leave those places as it swarms with a lot of people either shopping or partying. Imagine my excitement at experiencing this area with such chill vibes with same cosmetics stores, high end stores and artistic buildings. If you are looking for a chill place to get coffee or buy sports clothing or casual wears with less people and less noise. This is the place."
My favorite place to be!,Great place to explore....... a good choices of boutiques and also shops. Much quieter in comparison with other tourist spot. The beauty of the season can be seen here along the street. 
Only good for restaurants...,"This place is only good for restaurant options. The hype for the brand name that I do not even know of is not worth it. Also, it is disappointing that certain stores do not even let you try on shirts and you can not return or exchange it. Not a good spot for shopping in my opinion. "
Used to be much better...,"This area used to be a trendy area with a lot of nice cafes, restaurants, and boutique shops. However, in the recent years has seen a huge number of big brands coming in and made the whole area a.... meh... not interesting any more."
Hip quarter of seoul,"lots of nice different restaurants , coffee shops, tea houses , nice shops , very good spot to buy cosmetics"
Great shopping experience,"Great Shopping experience, trendy place for shopping in South Korea. Lot of restaurant in Shinsadong "
Better than Myeongdong,"I went to both Garosu-gil and Myeongdong shopping streets and I have to give Garosu-gil 2 thumbs up! As a cafe / coffee lover, I recommend exploring this place! You will find unique and hipster coffee houses as well as the usual coffee houses (such as Line Cafe) you will commonly find in Korea. Moreover, you see people wear really trendy and fashionable clothes here than in Myeongdong. Another bonus point is there are quite a number of insta-photo spots where you can take nice photos :)"
Gingko Tree Lined Street,"I visited the Bohemian-chic Garosu-Gil Street in my day tour. It is an upscale and trendy shopping and art district located south of the Han River in Sinsa-dong, Gangnam-gu. We had limited time for roaming around. Garosu-gil, also known as ""Gingko Tree Lined Street"". The vibs are very youthful and hippy. SEE photos"
Great street for cafe and shopping!,This street is lined with fashion stores and cafes and youthful crowds. It's better than the many malls in Seoul as it offers good diversity and nothing beats outdoor shopping!
Boring street,"Although there are lots of people here, but for some reason, I don’t feel any excitement here. Lots of cafeteria and some restaurants selling non Korean food. No street food. If you are looking for food, you might have better luck with the next parallel street to this one. "
Interesting area with great shops,"It is a totally different experience beside visiting temples, palaces and ""hot"" food :) Many designer's shops and cute cafe to visit. Its a very kid friendly and most of them speak English very well...phewww"
Something Different,This tree lines street is filled with boutiques which offer really nice clothes and accessories. We also enjoyed cafes from the quaint 8 SECONDS cafe to the cutie ones like Line and Skin food cafe. Not crowded at all.
quality shopping place,"Unlike Myungdong (a lot of tourists, China town-like), this place is less crowded, with trendy/quality shops and cafe. Shops open at 10-10:30, early enough for most. Attached my lovely daughter in LINE store. "
Must-visit for all fashionista,"You need to dedicate your entire afternoon at garosugil. Over here they have unique clothing boutique that shouts 'korean-style'. And of course its selling at a higher price as the design you can't find it at places like hongdae, edae or myeongdong. Judging from the quality it definitely worth the price. My advice is don't focus only on shops located along the main street. There are many more hidden gems inside those narrow alley. If you are tired there are plenty of cafes for you to choose. Have a sip of coffee and enjoy people-watching, or you can chit-chat with friends. Also, there are a lot of instaworthy corners for you to explore. Don't be shy because they are many people posing for photos too. I hope you guys will enjoy garosugil as much as I do."
coffee & shopping road,short road but lots of shops and cafe in this area. clothes and accessories are pricey but some is unique and worth for money. those who love cafe hopping must love this neighborhood! 
Garosugil Glam,"This is one place that draws me more than Myeongdong for its more glitzy image and less congested street. Although the shops here are more upmarket, this street sprouts into narrower alleyways that lead you to myriads of cafes that offer a tantalising array of cakes and lattes. Four years ago i had stumbled upon this tiny but quaint cafe called the Banana cafe which serves cakes in a flowerpot and lattes topped with pink cotton candy. If you love skin care then you must visit the Skin Food Cafe after shopping for its products and the Dr Jart flagship store that flaunts its state-of-the-art deco to lure you to buy its array of products that promise to transform your face into a flawless complexion. That i can vouch for after I bought it’s line of Ceremide masks that uses nano technology!"
Shopping paradise,"A more unique and refined shopping experience in Seoul with its gingko tree lined avenue compared to the cosmetic street in Myeondong or the bargain basement sweep in Dongdaemun.Be warned that it may be expensive. Fun place to people watch, window shop or to have a cup of coffee"
shopping district & Plastic surgery,One of the trendy & posh shopping district for the wealthy in seoul. And plenty of cafe & restaurant & bar around the area. But the most intersting sight i notice are many people walking with bandages after having plastic surgery.
Tree-lined street with autumn hues,The street is beautiful and lined with trees filled with autumn colours. There are many trendy shops and cafes scatter around the area. The people here seems more affluent looking and well-dressed compared to other areas.
beautiful street,beautiful street with shops along both sides and nice cafes to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and some pastries. It was autumn and the trees along the road was just beautiful
Cafe Heaven!,"I love Garosu gil! So many cute cafes and trendy shops, it's one of my favorite places in Korea. Anything hip and trendy can be found here."
Youth road,"It's a good place for hangout. There are a lot of coffee shop, makeup store, and clothing store for youngsters."
Cool & refined,There are diverse and cool shops and restaurant. Garosugil is most wealthy area in Seoul. So there are many sexy and young girls here
Interesting exploration,"Filled with many independent shop, this place is a great exploration where one is able to see the talent and artistic korean in many aspect from fashion to jewellery. There are many high end shops here too"
so chic,"garosugil is a place to see and be seen. right smack in the heart of plastic surgery town, every corner you go, you will meet someone with bandages and theyre not afraid to show. this is the place to people watch and you can tell from the countless cafes with themes you will be spoilt for choice. a person can only stomach that much of a coffee in one day, but theyre so attractive i wanna hang out at more cafes. you can also grab your makeup supply and k fashion here. notable shops to stop by include, line, artbox, karl lagerfeld. "
posh but cozy,"i really fell in love with this area. full of shopping and hang out places, but somehow it's still comfortable and not so run down with tourists. you can get a glimpse at the life of somewhat upper class seoulites. good looking bunch, i must say!"
shopping / cafehopping,"Went to this place cos of Line & Friends cafe, despite it being known for its many cafes. Friends had a good lunch there and we had fun walking / shopping around"
Life in pink,"Great for shopping beauty products, calm streat, modern, great food and restaurants, spotted some vintage cars too"
A real shopping street,"Garosu-Gil is a real shopping street. Not only a local brands but also korea brands and designer's shops are located in this street. Not only fashion but also chic restaurants and cafes are situated in this street. You can enjoy shopping, eating, and chilling all day and all night. "
The rich part of town,Much cleaner than other areas in Seoul but this is matched by the calibre of shop and the general attitude of the people wandering around even more image conscious than the regular people around Seoul.Quite a few nice restaurants and far less busy which can be nice.
Yellow and bright - perfect for a stop over,There is no shortage of café in Garosu-gil but Skin food café was lovely bright and delicious. don't miss out while you stroll down this lovely street.
Fun shopping district,"If you're into a fun shopping experience, with upscale architecture and designer labels this is a must see destination in the Gangnam district of Seoul. Many shops are affordable as well and offer unique one of a kind items. "
great shopping,anything and everything can be bought here. If you are looking for Korean cosmetics - you will find it here
Great street to chill,"Went here twice during our stay in Seoul. The main street is great, but the really nice and chic cafes are in the little streets branching out from the main street, so a little bit of exploration is advised.We found really good places like C27, Acacia, Gilbert's Burgers and Fries, FIKA from these smaller streets and they're worth checking out."
Great place to walk around and discovery,"Love this place, I found this place kinda artistic. Gentle monster is aound this neighborhood, try to walk as deep as possible and you will discover a lot of good stuff. I made a video on my trip to seoul, come and watch my video for better details.search title :#5 TRAVEL BLOG DAY 4 SEOUL - BEAUTY STORE CAFE "
Neighborhood much larger than Dosan-Daero 13-gil!!,"We stayed in this neighborhood as a base for exploring the rest of Seoul. Advantages are that there are numerous small streets on either side of Dosan-Daero 13-gil to explore filled with boutique cafes, restaurants, bars, karaoke, and shops. Although Dosan-Daero 13-gil has lots of western name brand stores, the streets to either side seem to mostly have one-offs that are currently under-represented on trip advisor. There are very few western tourists on these side streets but it seems very popular with local 20- and 30-somethings. Restaurants range across Korean, Japanese, French, Italian, Mexican, Indian, Thai, Vietnamese. Especially enjoyable for walking around in the early evenings when it is cooler and the shops are still open (generally until 9 or 10pm). A little harder to find restaurants for breakfast before 10am, though there are some. Arrive using the Sinsa metro station, take exit 8, and then turn down any of the streets to the left to access the area."
Worth going,"10mins walk from MRT station. I personally quite like the environment. Very nice street with mixture of boutiques, cafes and restaurants. I went there twice during the trip."
The Rodeo Drive of Korea,"Garosu-gil is located in the Gangnam area of Seoul. This is the more affluent part of the city, with BMW's and designer brands as commonplace as coffee shops. The best part about this place is that it's so scenic. Even if you have no major cash to spend on the big stores and brands, you can have a good time walking by the sidewalk and enjoying the trees swaying in the breeze. There are also lots of great places to eat here, which cater to all cuisines and tastes. (Try finding the Flying Pan and Saigon Market, which are really great places to try.) Don't be afraid to go into side alleys either, because we were able to try some delicious desserts at one of the cafes on their roof deck. Also checkout Artbox, which is a great place to buy affordable/quality souvenirs! I was annoyed I didn't find this sooner. Garosu-gil isn't the shopping mecca for millennials or frugal folks, but it's still worth visiting for the sights and sounds! "
Very good but need more restrooms. ,"It very good to feel the gangnam style. It was very good when I first visit here at that time I didn't feel any inconvenience but today (9 June, 2017) I am waiting for customers. There is no ""Open Restrooms"" in this street. (In South Korea, we have many oppen restroom for visitors.) So I have buy drinks or coffee to go to restroom or I have to far to subway station. It is very uncommen in South Korea that don't have open restroom in the shooping street or tour destinations. :-( "
"Lovely tree lined place with shopping, cafes!","If you enjoy cafe hopping, this is a must visit on your list. Don't forget to wonder off the main road as that is where many cafes are located and don't forget to look up as most cafes are not located on ground floor.If you live shopping, this is also a great place to visit. Prices here are not like those underground subway shopping, it is more expensive here. However, the style here is different from those sold at the underground subway shops... So it's not apples for apples comparsion."
a walk among the chic stores,"both sides of this road are packed with stores, small shops. many can be found in other areas. not as crowded as myeong dong"
Good for shopping; not as vibrant as Myeongdong,"We aren't big shoppers and were going more for the people watching and to see another part of Seoul. We had just been in Myeongdong, which I found to be far more vibrant. Garosu-gil had more American brands (Tommy Hilfiger, Polo, etc.), so wasn't as interesting for us. Again, if you're just going for people watching & the scene, I would skip this and stay in Myeongdong."
Come here to find some designer clothes,"Short shopping street, come here to find some designer clothes. It is a kind of boulevard located not far from the metro station, full of interesting shops (small) with designer clothes. Several cafes are located here also so if you are not interested to buy anything just sit on the terrace with your espresso and watch Korean chicky-micky hipsters ;-))"
"Lovely, especially for cafe hopping!","The place is lined up with cafes and independent fashion brands, along with some branded shops like Gentle Monster. I would recommend this place to those who want a more chill day in Seoul. The district is not very crowded (since it's more high-end) so it is a good place to hang at when you want to take a breather from Myeongdong or Hongdae."
Expensive shopping area,"Quaint shopping area but aside from some nice restaurants, the clothing stores are all the same in every mall and shopping district you visit. There are a lot of the same Uniqlo, Zara, H&Ms etc everywhere and lack of local fashions or works. This area is for people with money, as is all the areas around Apjujeong district. Myeongdong has more variety but it's lower quality. "
Upmarket shopping area with lot of interesting coffee houses,I was there with a few of my friends. We visiting the trendy shops - some famous brands such as Gentle Monster. This place is more like a museum than a shop selling glasses. You have other cute unique boutiques selling local brands. I adore the coffee shops there - big and great for people watching.
charming district with trendy people,"What a charming district lined with trees and everyone dresses up so fashionably!Seems like a higher end district but good place to hang out, people watch or just relaxing in a cafe. Had limited time in garosu-gil but will definitely return again!"
Good place for people watching!,We visited on a Sunday afternoon. The street is an upmarket shopping area with nice coffee shops or chilling our or people watching. It was fun to stroll down the street. There is a Line shop with Cafe. Coffeesmith also looks very popular and a place to be seen. Osulloc was good for green tea desserts. Lots of designer local and foreign shops. 
Really liked it,"I went here twice because I liked it so much. They have amazing cafes and nice clothes shops (Mango, Hollister etc). I went on a sunday afternoon and I think it was a good time, because everyone sat outside at a cafe. Don't go in the morning as shops and cafes might still be closed. I would come back here."
Cute,We got lost in Gangnam and ended up in this beautiful place. But it was too quiet and was not as fun as Myeongdong.
Fashionable and pleasant,"I went there on a Monday morning via subway. The ride was pleasant and not packed as I expected it to be as it was 9am at the time. People are definitely dressed a lot more trendy and fashionable here. Had a latte (excellent!) at Coffeesmith (left side of garosu-gil as you turn in and walk a few metres) before I strolled the street as most shops only open at 10:30 or 11am. I must say wi-fi was excellent in that area as I could connect to free wifi as I walked along the street. Tip : Signal is exceptionally strong in front of Sulbing (dessert shop not far from Coffeesmith) and across the street from it. The street has individual shops selling fashionable/trendy clothing & shoes of western and local labels, cosmetics, unique jewellery pieces and plenty of cafes and restaurants."
Best eye candy in Seoul ,"Girls are Hot Hot Hot and good good good looking here - great eye candyMust visit and be sure to check out every shop, might find yourself the next k pop star.Oh shops are a good on a small streetDidn't end up linking the walk to apjugeong or cheongdam - it feels the same"
Shopping at is best.,this area is quite a hot spot for fashion loversso many small shops and cafésreally nice to spent some hours here
Average,We went here with the hope of seeing Korean celebrities. There are quite a number of upscale coffee places and stores around.
Cat cafe Shinsa Dong,One of the lovely Cat cate located at Shinsa Dong. Its worth to go to take a rest to visits lovely cats overthere. Especially where there is cold or hot outside or you have been too tired after shopping.
Girly shopping street in Shinsa-dong,Girly shopping street in Shinsa dong with lots of shops selling mostly ladies' goods such as clothing and accessories.
Hip Street,"I always visit Garosu-gil when in Seoul but it's more on the higher end of shopping and dining. The shops are a bit pricier and dining can add up too depending on where you go. They do have cute shops so you'll see a lot of tourists and young crowds hanging out in this area. If you are looking for something more cultural, then I wouldn't really waste too much time here."
Nothing special,"Modern street with shops and cafes, could be anywhere in the world, nothing special.I prefer Bukchon to hang out for coffee!"
Just a street,Another overhyped area called a tourist attraction for a reason that's beyond me. Shops for luxury brands or just simply local ones that's been gentrified. Cafes and restaurants here and there. There's really nothing outstanding here.
A shopping heaven for fashionistas,Nice place to check out cafes and shop here. This place is perfect for fashionistas and Korean skin care product fans
"Short, fashion street","Its a good place to walk after a heavy lunch. The streets are lined with designed trees, there are a few cafes offering coffee and pastry."
Nice Shopping Street,"Relax walking street with many Korean cosmetics shops, ladies boutiques & the popular LINE store.Found a nice cafe opposite side of the shopping area."
Garosu,Nice to street to buy different stuff at reasonable prices. Restaurants and bars can be found here as well
Perfect to spend a lazy afternoon,"A tree lined street rolling with boutiques and cafes, this place is perfect for an afternoon stroll. Cafes here are known for their food so visit one or two to have some cake and coffee and watch the world go by."
"Short, compact and chic!","Apparently this is the 'it' street where all the cool people go.It's a cute area, the street itself is only about 700m or so with shops on both sides including Forever 21 and the Line store. It reminds me of Chapel St in Melbourne or Bleecker St in New York, small but fashionable. The side streets offer alot of more upscale restaurants while the main drag is mainly boutiques.Nice area to visit but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here."
Very beautiful place,I love Garosu-gil area. Their shopping street is so beautiful. You can get everything here and there are a lot of mural as well. Instagram worth it place. 
Great shopping area,"Garosu-Gil, is located in Sinsa district, Gangnam, means tree street. Adorned with gingo trees, Garosu-Gil stretches less than a kilometer. There are tons of stores on the both side of garosu street. Line 3, exit 8 of Sinsa Station"
Nice neighborhood in Seoul.,"This area of Seoul is very easy going,has lots of places where you can buy many things in affordable prices.Very crowded on weekends, but still you can walk around with ease.Better to go after lunch or at the end of the afternoon."
Welcome to the glitz and glamour of South Korea!,"On the one hand, Garosu-gil ""Green Street"" is basically a collection of over-priced restaurants and coffee shops. On the other hand, if you want to see how the young, rich, and beautiful of Korea spend their afternoons this is the place to go. Definitely worth visiting for at least 30 minutes before going elsewhere."
Trendy slow walk,"Despite some of the other reviews, this is a great area to walk around and slowly drink your cup of coffee. Enjoy the people watching of this ever-so-trendy neighborhood. Take in a bite to eat if you have a chance. Yes, the shops are expensive but it's all about the experience. If time permits, this area is in close proximity of Hangang Park. With your second cup of coffee, take a walk over to the river. "
So so,"Before few years, this was very specialized in unique style shops. However, this place is filled with many franchises and plastic surgery hospitals for Chinese or Japanese...... this is not worth becoming one of your trip plans when visiting Seoul...Just go Gyeng Buk Goong."
Amazing place for a date ,Lovely place with lots of nice cafes and good restaurants filled with fashionable people. A shopping haven for girls at the Main Street. 
good shopping experience,"you can see celebrities and models, expensive cars; you can also see people with bandages over their faces after plastic surgeries shopping around. Shops are of mid range price tag. in the side streets, there are many local food stalls where you can try Korean BBQ and Seafood restaurants with live fish"
Really nothing to see,"Really nothing interesting to see besides some shops, cafes. Just few people wearing facial masks and sunglasses ... Not worth visiting"
Best place to get coffee in Seoul,"As a coffee drinker, I was pleasantly surprised to find this neighborhood. Depending on where you are staying in Seoul, Garosu-gil can either be quite convenient or a bit out of the way (as Seoul is such a big city). Once you get there, however, there is so much to explore and so much coffee to drink!First, the coffee. I never thought Seoul would have great coffee, but it was hands-down the best coffee I've had in Asia. There are so many cafes that line this neighborhood that it was so hard to just choose a few to try. I had a smooth and rich vanilla latte at one cafe and an impeccable cappuccino at another. One of the best drinks I had, however, was a marron (chestnut) latte and I don't think there was even coffee inside. Second, Garosu-gil is also quite a hipster neighborhood, so there are also lots of boutique clothes and artisan shops to explore. It was definitely worth spending a full day there."
Boutique Shops and cafe hopping,"I had a great day with amazing food in the restaurant, yummy latte/ dessert during cafe hopping, enjoyable shopping in the boutique shops and nice walk along the shopping street. It would be a good place to go if you enjoy boutique shops experience."
Coffee shops and clothing stores,This district is nice if you just want to get a cup of coffee/tea at a trendy cafe and watch the beautiful Koreans or go shopping. 
Great place to spend a slow Sunday ,There are lots of small shops to walk around and coffee shops to chill. There are also nice restaurants around the area with good atmosphere. 
A place for the young ones,A place to shop and eat. A good place to hang around with its unique architecture. Many young ones can be found in this place. Love the shops and the food.
Nice cafe and walking on the street ,We went there late around sunset and we send nice time walking around. It is good to spend three hours. 
A lot of interesting shops,There were a lot of small interesting shops. But I found nothing special compared to Myungdong. Good place to walk around and check out nice cars parked on the side street. 
Lots of little shops and nice cafes!,"If you like shopping and cafe hopping, this is the place to be! If you go, don't forget to visit Banana Tree - it's a tiny cafe, but has Instagram worthy drinks and desserts! "
The Beverly Hills of Gangnam,"During the Spring and some summer days, this is probably the closest you'll ever get to feeling like you are in California while traveling in Korea. Garosu-gil translates to ""street of trees"" or something like that. Boutique stores, coffee shops, and restaurants are situated on both sides of the street. I would even recommend going off the beaten path and exploring the side streets. There you will find other places which may tickle your fancy. During weekends expect large crowds. If you stop in a coffee shop, don't be surprised if the person sitting beside you is famous. Garosu-gil is notorious to see and be seen. "
Less crowded ,There are shops but not as many as I expected but in return less crowded (on a Sunday afternoon). There a high-end shops but also average one. 
beautiful place to hang around,"Many shops and cafes along the road. The area is very clean and offer a nice view along the way. Many teenagers are here for shopping and hanging out. The shops are on the trendy and expensive side, but not luxury. But many cafes there are so nice. It's a good place for people who want to spend time shopping in a place not as crowded as Myeongdong or Hongdae."
Excellent shopping! ,"We went on a Sunday and enjoyed the variety of shops and prices (lower, comparing to Japan), so it was paradise for us on a girls trip. Plenty of cozy cafe shops to stop by, so you can relax as well - there are some nail salons too if interested. A must do if you are looking for shopping, and we had a very nice Korean lunch nearby."
Cafe Hopping Experience,"Love the beautiful gingko trees that line the street here. There are many cafes - good for catching up with friends. For shopaholics and cafe-hoppers, this area is a must. There are many photo taking opportunities of the shop fronts. Beautiful place. Will return again."
expensive shops but good cafes,lots of shops but a little expensive. The cafes are really nice and relaxing. Good to come for a day to enjoy coffee and deserts.
Enjoy the side street better,"The main street is too big, 2 lanes for each direction so the trees along the street is not give you much impression. But when you go to the side street, only one lane for each direction, then you will get better impression. Nothing special in terms of stores - it's almost the same except there's a lot of Plastic Surgery Clinics here."
Shopping and unique cafes.,"There's a lot of shopping to do in this area. If you're not looking to do some shopping, then let all the unique cafes attract you. It's a busy area, but worth going to and looking around. Even if you're not fully sure where you're going, its busy enough that you'll find something you like, be it a cafe or a store."
Lovely area with great shops and cafes,"If you want a less hectic shopping experience than Myeongdong or Hongdae, def check this place out. There are also a lot of cute cafes you can relax in and just people watch. Buildings are really unique as well.There's also a cute jewelry shop that makes custom rings for you. Just pick out a design, get sized, go to a cafe to chill, and come back in an hour or so."
shopping spot,"lots of cafe and fashion store, and the price also not so high depends on store you choose. you might wanna try their street food it's actually pretty good."
A shopping stop,You wouldn't miss this spot if you start your walk down Insadong street from the Anguk station. Interesting shops and cafes as you walk up the building from the ground to the top level. You get a good view of the surrounding areas at the top of the building.
Nice quiet stretch to spend in the evening,"Love the buildings, unique cafes and restaurants, beauty outlets minus the myeongdong crowd. Can spend the evening here strolling the streets and chill with good company over wine or beer"
Very great place for shopping,"Shopping local designer clothes. Good food are around the area. Seems like one of the hippiest place in seoul! Especially for fashionista, this is a great place for you!"
Just chilling,"Must go, if you love to take photos, you have to go here. There are many coffee shops and cafe. Look like you're in Europe!"
Cafes and shops along the street,"Great place for shop and just enjoy your time with friends, do find C27 cheesecake shop, they have the best strawberry cheesecake."
Shopping ,Definitely a great shopping area. Lots of cafes and boutiques. Apparently this area has a lot of plastic surgery clinics and makeup studios. There are a number of hotels in the area. Interesting restaurants also line the streets. 
Great street to explore exquisite cafes and shops!,"This street houses many unique interesting cafes and shops. Many local designers are also in this street exhibiting their designs in terms of jewelry, clothes etc. there's also a huge Line Friends shop, and many international brands. "
"A place with so many hip cafes, you need more than a day to check them out","A hip place with a more wealthy target audience. Cafes line the streets and backstreets. There is a Line Cafe in this area and I heard its's new. Had one of the best bagels in the Line Cafe to my surprise. Quaint restaurants as well, and the people there are pretty trendy. Worth a morning or afternoon visit to any of the cafes there. "
Garosoo Avenue at Sinsa-Dong in Seoul,"There are lots of restaurants, cafes, clothes shops, and so forth along the avenu, which are very good to browse. You can see many tourists, couples, and students walking aroun there. The parking fee there is a little high."
I loved this place.,"Amazing place full of shops and hidden gems, It's my favourite place in Seoul, you could just walk and wonder, eat and shop. you could basically do a lot of stuff there."
Lovely street,Nice street with trees on both side. Many lovely shops and cafe.. Just strolling along and taking pictures is perfect. Some parts feels like in europe
lost its charm,"Tons of cafes for you to sit and people watch or to relax. There are lots more international brands in the area now as compared to two years ago, some of the shops I remembered were no longer there. There is a stand alone 3CE store worth visiting but it was quiet when I went. Shops pricing is in the mid to high level tier."
Best Place to Sip your Coffee and Shop,The road is very lively. I love the coffee shops here and also the high quality stores. Would definitely come back again to enjoy the higher class street in Seoul. 
Really posh,This place is really posh. You can see a lot of clothes shops and cafes here. There are many pretty and stylish girls on the street. You can also see quite many girls and boys who wear masks. I guess they just finish their plastic surgery.
mid - high end shopping area with curated items,shops can range from mid to high end depending on what you are looking for.. a nice area for shopping with local designers goods and curated shops which makes viewing easier..
Not as charming as expected,"Garosu-gil is beautiful with gingko tree lined streets, upscale urban shopping and too many adorable cafes to count. Think, Soho in NYC. Its got a European feel and I guess that what I didn't love about it - lacks Korean charm. Feels like it could be any upscale shopping area in a large city. Its almost like they are trying too hard NOT to be Korean. But, the cafes are lovely with emphasis on COFFEE and DESSERTS (Korea is not a tea culture), everyone speaks English fairly well and you can find lots of ""western"" restaurants here - especially pasta and tacos. A nice stop but I ended up taking subway all the way back to Ssamjil-gil in Insadong where I found WAY more unique things to buy."
Has lost its charm over the years,"Like someone else on here said, this area has completely lost its charm. When I visited a few years ago, it was full of independent cafes and very interesting shops to look at. The area also had a very cosy, hippie vibe. You could wander around the side alleys and there was always something interesting to see/buy. I was looking forward to doing that again this time around – but nope. Now all of that is gone and a lot of these unique shops have all been replaced by huge retail/international brands and a lot of cafes have moved to quieter, out-of-the-way places. I was looking around for this lovely café (Bloom and Goute) only to find that they have moved to a really odd area in some alley and had closed down!! Lots of shops have suffered the same fate. There’s also a distinct pretentious and snobby feel to the area, especially coupled with the somewhat stylish people who go there and have coffee and just sit around wanting to be seen. Interestingly, lots of girls in face masks – more than anywhere else I’ve visited in Seoul, possibly just out from one of the many plastic surgery clinics in the area. Almost everything here is overpriced, from the food to the coffee to the clothes and accessories. If you are looking to experience the Real Seoul, just skip this place and go somewhere else. I don’t think it offers much for the casual traveller looking to experience something about the local culture."
Awesome shopping!,Beauty stores galore - make sure to check out Belport Apothecary. Cool reasonably priced clothing as well!
Great place to visit for shopping and coffee or tea,"If you have nothing to do, go this place to eat, drink, shop, and do people watching. there are many cafe and shops. Most fun thing for me was sit down in a coffee shop and watched people walking by."
Boring and uninspiring,"Just a street with your standard shops. Nothing special and no different from what you can get from an airport lounge. Cafes and restaurants are over priced as it is a ""classy"" neighborhood. This really is a boring place"
No longer worth visiting,"This used to be a great cozy street with local designers and boutiques, but now is just a mainstream shopping lane with Starbucks, Nescafe, Forever 21 and other brands you find in any mall in any city. Granted, there are still a few authentic boutiques left, but most have been chased away by exorbitant rental rates and chased into the smaller alleys off the main street. Boring, but if you go stay off the main street and venture into the alleys. "
산책도 하고 맛난 음식+디저트,"자주는 아니지만 산책+밥+디저트 하러 옴. 꼭 와야 될 정도는 아니지만 괜찮은 레스토랑 디저트샾이 꽤 있기에 추천.not so often, but come here with friends to hang out. good to take a walk and window shopping. Not a must visit spot, but recommendable cause there r good options for food and desserts."
For the hipsters!,"Although Garosu-gil shops are mostly tagged with brands, it's super relaxing to take a stroll along this street. It doesn't feel like I'm in Korea. Everything is so trendy at Garosu-gil and people spotted here dress really well! It's like Apgujeong and Cheongdamdong, but not as high end. Lots of nice cafes are located here too. One of the nicest places to chill in Seoul!"
Lovely place ,"Lovely area , many clothes shop , make up and desserts , include restaurant and lovely coffee shop . A bit higher price but unique and not too crowded like myeongdong . Good for walking along the street , relaxing :))) "
Quasi-European feel,"A lovely area to stroll around and relax on a weekend. Other than those common brands, there are some independent stores in this area. My favourite Cafe Osulloc also has a store here."
Cool little boutiques here and a lot of the big names,"This was a fun place to shop, there are leopard print shops, a huge MCM and a Whoo store. Also a few Western brands coming in like H&M. They have some nice multi- boutiques here as well selling various Korean brands"
Hip place to shop in Seoul,"Garosu-gil has been duped as 'Europe in Seoul'. It is a trendy and hip place for you to shop, eat and just hanging around. This street frequently visited by the local fashionistas and young peoples that dressed well and look like supermodel, lol. I came here for cafe-hopping, which has various selection for independent and unique cafe that has nice interior. Good for photo-shooting too!"
Great rest shopping area,Also look for Hyundai department store walkable from here - higher quality then Harrods Nice quality shops in this street it is also near the famous gangnam area
Lovely street with cool quirky boutiques,Lovely place to walk and to have coffee in their quirky cafes and watch the world go by. Highly recommend the Korean restaurant at the end of the street called 'Insadong' (yeah a little strange since it is far away from actual insadong). Affordable and yummy bulgogi in a place where the coffees are expensive. 
"great area to explore, shop and grab coffee","When we lived in Korea last year, this was one of my favorite places to relax on Sunday. Lot of cute coffee shops, jewelry stores, and independent clothing shops. Also, restaurants and just a really pretty area to walk around. Grab a book or your laptop and head to a lovely coffee shop where you can unwind or people watch."
High End shopping,"with trees lining on both sides of the street, this street is very scenic. This area mainly sells luxury goods, but there are several facial shops around here."
Fashion street for fashionista,"We went there to see Gentle Monster Flagship store and 3CE cinema concept store. They are very interesting. Not only variety of products that they offer but also some exhibition for you to enjoy. If you have time, please visit. Beside these two, there are a lot of cafe, restaurants, and shops for you to enjoy."
Shopping mecca,Come with a loaded wallet. You'll want to spend days shopping here. We found some great deals at Aland and other chains stores. Lots of fun fashion to bring home with you. 
Nice atmosphere,Nice atmosphere and many good designed clothes shops. Along with cafe and coffee shop. recommended for a shopping and chilling. 
Cafe Haven,"plenty of cafes in this area, great for cafe hopping, also with many interesting themed cafes. Beautiful street with many boutiques, definitely worth spending some time here"
Nice alley during Autumn,It would be great to visit during Autumn. You will see the yellowish of Ginkgo trees along the alley. A lot of designers' shops along the street. Don't forget to drop by LINE Friends & Cafe.
Nice boutique street in seoul,It's a nice boutique street in seoul.. stores are quite expensive though.. some really nice coffee shops..there is a great burger joint hidden there called Gilbert's Burgers and Fries.
Beautiful in Autumn,"A beautiful street. Lots of unique small boutique and cosmetics store. Must visit Line Friends Store & Cafe. I was lost in the Line store and cafe for 2 hours, lots of cute stuff inside. Good place to take pictures."
LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT!,"For the bazillion trips I've made to Korea ~ this was my first time to Garosu-gil. I don't know why I've never been. But I absolutely loved it! It was love at first sight. So much to see and take in here. Great place to just hold hands, walk and take in with your loved one! The street is lined with beautiful trees changing leaves with changing seasons! A great place to hang out and explore. Don't forget to turn into the small streets to explore too! Lots of shopping too!! :)"
A must visit is the Line Friends Store & Cafe,"When one visits Garosu-gil, everyone seems to flock towards the Line Friends Store & Cafe found along the ginko tree lined street.We arrived early to beat the crowd, if you are into the Line Messaging App, you will go ga-ga like the fans we found here. They take photos with every soft toy of the Line Friends characters displayed here. The cafe is another must try as they serve food and drinks in the image of the Line Friends. This place is cuteness infinity."
Lost its charm,"I stayed in this area back in 2012 and loved its hipster charm and character then. Loved that the shops were unique and very local and that there were many small Korean restaurants. When I visited again this year though, there were more international brands and it looked and felt like any other high end street. It was also crowded and there were too many high end cars and too little parking areas. Very disappointing!"
authentic,"we went there at night to have a drink and buy some souvenirs. It's a quite cute area with low buildings that look old and authentic, lots to see, to eat and drink, don't miss it"
Gangnam Style to the MAX!,"This district is all about what is hip, happening, and now. See and be seen! Shop for trendy clothes and eat in celebrity chef restaurants. Grab a cocktail and watch the BMW's and Mercedes roll by. This is where the young, rich, and want-to-be K Pop stars come out the eat, shop and play!"
Nice place for a quick visit,"On our way to gangnam, we stopped off at garosu-gil for some shopping and dessert. This street targets your more affluent crowds. A very pleasant experience with plenty of shops, cafes and dessert spots to spend the afternoon."
Rows of interesting shops and cafes for the in crowd,"The crowd here is mostly younger, and it is the yuppie, more grown-up version of Hongdae/Sinchon. This is a popular date spot during fall, but I visited in the winter and it was still pretty, and had something for all my needs. Here, my husband bought a bag and wallet from a Japanese brand at a reasonable price, and there are many stylish selections among the shops, from casual streetwear to modern home decor. Highly recommend this for those who like the Hongdae/Sinchon area! "
Wow very good. ,"I visited today 21 October, 2015. Everything is tidy and all items are very trendy. Street is very clean and window shopping is also very good. After that go to a pub, grab a some drinks or snacks will make you more happy. Thumbs up. :) "
High End District,"We didn't plan to go to Garosugil but when I asked our tour guide for restaurant recommendations he told me to go to Garosugil because ambiance and surrounding is far different from the places we've been to.I later learned that it's a high end district mostly locals were there.. no tourists. Shops there are on the high end side and also cafes were beautifully designed. Cafes and restaurants there are just picture worthy, because of the style and design of the architecture. Truly the vibe is different.We ended up having grilled pork in one of the restaurants there, food was really great and a good run for money.If you have time you can go there and check it out but if love haggling and markets this is not the place to be."
A different view compared to Hongdae or Myeongdong,"This place is so different from Hongdae or Myeongdong, perhaps there are not many people around there. I like the ambience there too as it is less crowded."
Interesting Place to Visit During Autumn,"Gingko trees are lined up on Garusogil and its such a nice place too be during fall when leaves are changing folors. The place is not crowded, really an upscale place. Lots of shops including foreign brands are line up. Cafes and restaurants are also available in almost every corner. "
Shop! Shop! Shop till you drop,"Located at Sinsa with a stretch of shops consisting of quaint cafes like CoffeeSmith, fashion wear and of course restaurants.Excellent shopping street for everyone, and also a few pop-up shops at the alleys. If you want Korean fashion, Garosu-Gil offers clothing for the fashionistas. The brands are generally Korean but with a few European shops along the way."
Great shops,This is my favorite shopping area in Seoul. There are a lot of good coffee shops which serves great deserts. The clothes skips are my favorite. 
My Favorite place in Seoul ,"there's really a lot of nice cafes, interesting shops in such a beautiful street. the tree line makes shopping feels better. def my fav hangout place in Seoul "
Golden Gingko and Fashion during autumn,A fashion street staple for Seoulites looking for what's hip and not ordinary. Said to be a sight during autumn with the gingko trees lining the street turning golden. A favorite venue for fashion shoots. Lovely place to explore during a lazy afternoon. 
Cute shopping place!,"This area has a lot of cute shops and restaurants. It's a great place to visit in the afternoon. Also, a good place to get desserts! "
Lovely place with lots of cafes,"It is more of the high end side, but it definitely worth checking out. A lot of mix brands here, and so many hipster cafes. Had the best brunch here."
Sophisticated shops,"For those who aren't fans of Myeongdong, perhaps this place is a better option as there ain't that many tourists around (mostly filled with locals). There's a ton of famous restaurants here as well. "
Interesting place with European touches,"Interesting mix of European and Asian style, this place is filled with cafes, unique shops, and galleries. Line cafe is also located here."
Expensive Place,"This place has its own beauty, but I do not recommend people to buy something. They are too expensive than other places. Just look around, and spend some time. Food are fine."
a bit disappointing,"I planned Garosu-gil into my itinerary but I felt that it was overrated upon reaching there at about 4pm. We went into a cafe for coffee and cakes. By the time we were done , the sky was already dark and the whole street looked beautiful just like those in european countries. would recommend that others visit it at night rather in the day time."
Lovely shopping street with wide variety,"Garosu-gil is the tree lined avenue of many a korean drama - relatively narrow and rather pleasant to walk along. I found the shops here to offer a wider variety compared to myeondong, and there were no (or not many) repetitions of brands . in fact most of the shops seem to be those hip/unique ones where there is only one flagship. Quality was much better than myeongdong and in fact, prices were reasonable. in myeongdong they inflate the prices expecting you to bargain. in garosu-gil all the goods are fixed priced - more suited to my shopping style. Sizes tended to go up to UK12. would recommended to anyone for a stress free shopping day. there's a famous shop along this street which sold a steamboat made of fish and fish entrails.. all i can say is, i tried it and survived, but would not patronize again - however it was full of koreans, no english menu, definitely an authentic korean famous shop."
Relaxed European Atmosphere,"Beautiful area in Seoul which is so different... An area lined with gingko trees on both sides of the road, filled with lots of unique shops, cafes and restaurants.Definitely a wholesome new, special and enjoyable experience in Seoul!"
Not of my interest,"I went to Garosugil just out of curiosity but I did not enjoy being there at all. There are a lot of cafes and restaurant around and maybe some attraction like the Line Cafe but it just doesn't attract me. For someone who likes shopping, they might enjoy garosugil a lot but I don't really like shopping so it's not that fun for me"
Some special street,"Not big, but charming street.Fashion, Cuisine, persons...If you have a chance visiting KangNam, look around hear."
You'd better like shopping or drinking coffee,"Garosugil is the spot in Seoul for shopping, as the street features loads of clothing, accessories and cosmetics shops. Shops are very trendy, yet cheaper that what you could find a couple of blocks East in Apgujeong or Cheongdam. The coffee shop scene, vibrant throughout the city, is even better here. So, if you like high-street fashion and fancy coffee shop drinks, this is the place. however, if you're just looking for ""regular"" clothing, there maybe more options in Myeongdong, or in super malls such as the COEX or the Lotte World Mall. The street is indeed fairly short (a speed-walker could probably go from one end to the other in 15 minutes), and the side streets are not so numerous or bustling - yet, since garosugil has grown a lot recently). The quality of stores might be top notch, but there aren't quite as much as in other areas in Seoul. The dining scene is actually a bit below expectations, especially if you compare with Hongdae, Itaewon or even Myeongdong. Finally, besides the very Garosugil street, there is little else to do in the Northwestern part of Gangnam, so it does feel a bit secluded from other interested places."
Shopping & Desserts!,"Adorable, hip shopping area in Seoul. Loads of cool shops and boutiques including a number of chain stores. The dessert cafes are a must for a delicious stop. My husband I stopped at ""La Eskimo"" for some other-worldy cake and iced coffee. It's definitely the perfect way to relax after a nice walk through these beautiful streets!"
My Favorite Area in Seoul,"Easily my favorite part of Seoul! Quaint streets lined with stores which isn't as crowded as Meyongdong. It had a more relaxed vibe and I can spend hours in this place. Also discovered a new favorite store Neuf Hotel which is 4 stories of luxury and comfort, from clothes to furniture and home accessories. Be sure to spend at least a day here to walk around, shop leisurely and get a nice cup of coffee from one of the many coffee shops in the area. "
Trendy shopping,Easily reachable via subway exit 8. There are tons of small trendy shops on the side streets. Tons of eateries and trendy clothing stores. The best find is the Line Store and Cafe which opens noon. The streets are dotted with coffee shops. Particularly love Subling serving Korean dessert and with plenty seatings. Enjoy this neighorhood very much.
"Hip, trendy, very upmarket place..","This place is really upmarket. You can see this from the type of restaurants,cafes & shops.Also, so far this is the only place that we have seen many expensive cars around & also quite a few foreigners( European/American). Seems to be staying here rather than tourists.There are so many beautiful cafes you can just sit, have a drink & watch the world goes by.But definitely not for tourist shopping unless you are prepared to pay high prices for foreign branded stuff. Guess this place is for the rich.Good to come for the experience."
People watching,"If you want to people watch, this is the perfect place to find a chill cafe and just sit there for hours and watch the people go by. Very interesting place to visit if you like tree lined streets and cafe hopping."
"shopping, nice casual restaurant.",Active mode. Recommend walk. There are many cafe and restaurant. But very similar.
Interesting shops & cafe ,Lots of interesting cafe & many quaint shops around this area. Need to venture off to the side streets if you want to explore a bigger area. 
Fashion & Classic !,"I was introduced by my Korean friend about this street. I went there at night (9pm-11pm) and most of the shop still doing business till late. The street is quite long and you can enjoy all the lovely shop & gorgeous people! I just love looking at their style. If you are a fashion lover, please come here!"
My favourite street in Seoul!,"This is a trendy street where you can shop, eat or just walk around. It is a good spot for people watching. It is packed with well-dressed teens, models etc. "
"Trendy, Somewhat","This is very much a yuppie street for the young and rich, with unfortunately (or unsurprisingly) a slightly pretentious vibe. After you are done pushing past the scores of women with face masks (fresh from a visit to the plastic surgery clinic), you have to prevent yourself from keeling over at the sight of overpriced labels and price tags. While I can accept the place of local high-end boutiques, there are only a few of these here; many of the other shopping options are by your foreign brands.Unless you want to hang out with the crowd here, or need some new clothes to fit your new nose or new chin, I don't think this place offers much for the casual traveller."
place for trendsetters,"it's melting pot of those young rich, famous, artsy. For just hangout, you can find the Kirin Ichiban beer garden. Or music lover, there's small isle not far from forever 21 where you can see underground music scene of young and talented jazz and soul musicians performs"
Boutique clothing shops + trendy cafes for young people,"First thing I noticed about this place was the boutique clothes that are different from the too-similar looking ones in Myeongdong, Dongdaemun and the usual retail chains. Some of the clothes are designed by the shop owners themselves, so they can be really unique, but it also goes to say that they can be on the pricey side.The cafes and restaurants here are divided into Japanese, Chinese, Western and Korean, and for tourists, we might not really want to visit the Japanese, Chinese, Western restaurants when we are already in Korea, so please go and find out where the Korean restaurants and cafes are. There are long stretches of Japanese and Western restaurants nearer to the metro station, hence it can be rather tempting to walk into one before you even step onto the street with Korean restaurants, but don’t do it! Aim for the Korean ones. Even if you choose to visit the Western ones, please be prepared to speak in Korean to the waitress and waiter. Get ready your Korean phrases for “no chili, no spicy” etc, for any special requests that you might have, to prevent regrets.The cafes here are really special, and it is quite cool to just sit in one café for the entire afternoon/night too. Awesome place for young people to come with your friends, and you could come alone too. The only thing I probably regret in this trip is that we allocated too little time for garosugil and did not visit as many cafes as we would have liked. So if you are coming, please plan for at least 4 hours more than what you originally intended."
One of the best places to shoot a picture in Seoul,"Before starting to make a travel around the world, I used to live around Garosu-gil. Now is the time you should go see and stroll along the road because there's a lot of fallen leaves with yellow-tinted street lamps and beautiful signboard waiting to be seen- get along the road till you get to Gosu-buji (Han-river Park) and enjoy the park along the river. I lived there for a long time, so my tip is you must see this street when snow has fallen. Couldn't be better! You'd better bring your state-of-the-art camera with you; if you don't have it, you should bring your smart phone. Take a picture and you can get a once-in-a-lifetime picture. Believe me; you will never regret. I myself had taken a lot of good pictures in this street."
A lot to see,"This long stretch of road has a lot of franchised coffee shops and small shops. You'll be able to see Korean style clothes. I would recommend wondering about the side roads off from the main road. There are more cafés and boutique shops. Bear in mind when you are planning your visit, that Garosugil is favoured by young couples so it gets extremely crowded during the weekends. "
A must go,Love the restaurants and cafésGood shopping spot and hang outA place to see and be seen if you're a posh young adultI found a lot of great food in Garosu Gil area
Nice to shop,"I stayed in Ibis Gangnam hotel and it took around 20 minutes by taxi. I could see the distance between them were not far but because of the traffic jam, it took more. I recommend to take subway instead of taxi. However it was full of young guys shopping around. Very crowded shopping spot with many restaurants. I wish they have more Korean brands than international one like Zara, H&M, Hollister etc.... Beside that it was good place to shop and eat."
Shopping at Gangnam,"This is a great place to shop. There are many smaller boutiques & vintage shops along the street. Keep an eye for many outlets with great discounts on some of the korean designs and even designer items. There are many cafes, though more ""western"" cuisine than korean. However, there's a great fried chicken place called Hansu Chicken, which is after Forever 21, opposite King Kong Steakhouse. Only opens after 5 pm but if u can grab a couple of beers, and a plate of fried chicken, it's simply delish!!"
A great way to spend a Saturday,"A 5 minute taxi drive from the Ritz Carlton hotel in Gangnam, where we were staying, found us on a very popular tree lined road at 11 am along with the first shoppers of the day beginning to see what might be of interest.This street is popular with tourists and locals alike and provides a great range of high street names and local boutique fashion and accessories shops.There are a lot of coffee shops and restaurants in the area and quite a few 'outlet' and ""pop up"" stores with - when we visited - some really good prices.More than the shopping, however, a visit to Garosugil is well worth the trip for the people watching alone. The style of the local fashionistas being very much on display."
Indie-feel with tons of cafe and shops,"This place gave off a very indie feel while I was there. Shops were mainstream shops(like F21, MCM) so don't expect to find any bargains or cheap clothes here!There are a lot of cafés and coffee shop houses here."
Upscale Trendy Neighbourhood,Walked along the main street during day time for some interesting Korean designer boutiques. Things here are generally more expensive but they are of higher quality. There are also some shops which caters to the more eccentric fashionista. Walk over to inner streets and you will discover some hidden gems too. Many cafes around too and Mango Six is recommended for a short tea time. A local told me this place is more interesting and happening at night on a weekend. I like this place as it's not overly crowded and much more of a joy to walk around.
Interesting shopping & cafes,shopping area with trendy cafes & shops. A joy to walk along when the weather is good. plenty of photo opportunities & star gazing (if you know your Korean stars). 
Good Shopping Fix,"Liked this place as a respite from the usual Korean tourist sites. They had a lot of more upscale shops with local designers behind it. We got really cool eye frames, shoes, clothes & a very unique leather bag in this area. All made locally. Also had our chocolate fix at the Godiva cafe on this street. Great place to have coffee & watch the trendier ""Gangnam"" folk walk by. Not unusual to even see some freshly bandaged Koreans walk out of the plastic surgery clinics in the area.Reminds me of New York's Soho district but Korean style."
Great Restaurants and Shopping,"I visited a few times, but it's quite interesting. There are so many great restaurants in this area. High end food at mid price on competition. Even restaurants and coffee shops are featured and published in life style magazins like Monocles and Condes Nast. Use the mobile apps to look for venues. Restaurants my friends took were all in weird corners but fully occupied and booked most of time, just like all locals know while tourists like me can't think of going. All worth a visit. There seems more tourists than fancy local girls nowadays, but there are many fancy local designers selling niche stuff like alligator handbags at US$600-700 and cute fashionable t-shirts at US$20-30. Take 3 hours for food and shopping. Maybe a bit longer in case you'd like to sit in the cafe to check out gorgeous local people."
Too commercial but yet with quite a lot of local designer shop,"It's not very busy & hanging around there for coffee & some local designer shop is quite leisure, easily kill a couple of hours. But not much excitement, products are commercial rather creative "
Love it,"Love it, shopping, cafes, and cherry koko is a very evil shop. I bought too many things but they were great value! Perfect Korean quality"
"Great food, shopping and cafe's","This is a great area for an afternoon with the girls or for a quick shopping trip with your family. There are a lot of cafes and unique shops with nice and decently priced clothing. One difficult thing is that there is often only 1 or 2 of each piece and if you are not super thin as many Koreans are, you will have a hard time finding clothes so stick to shoes or grab a drink and people watch. "
Great food and shopping,"European inspired street Garosu-gil has many upscale boutiques to shop at and street vendors. Kind of reminds me of Newbury Street in Boston. There are also many restaurants to dine at on the street and coffee shops. It's a beautiful street with lots of ginko trees on it, and there are many side streets that have shops on them too. Definitely save one or two days to eat dinner at the restaurants on Garosu-gil!"
Great Place to chill out,"Better known as ""Shinsa-dong"". It's known to be a boulevard lined with row of small boutique shops. There are many hip cafes here. Nice place to spend time here either shopping or just having a coffee, catching up with friends, or watching the crowd."
Gingko lined street,"Its a cozy hip place if you're into shopping, cafes and people watching. Shopping is not cheap but you can stroll around and stop to grab a cup of latte in the array of quirky cafes."
My favorite area in Seoul!,"This street was not the easiest to find (exit 8 Sinsa station), but was totally worth the search, it has really nice shops (upscale international and asian but still affordable) and restaurants, some bars. We went in the evening but I would imagine that it would be as nice lunchtime. We also saw a live band in a bar called 'crazy horse' , they were great! Overall compared to other areas in Seoul this was my favorite!"
"Cafés, fashion boutiques & art","If you're into fashion, food & art then this precinct has it all. The main street is mostly dedicated to fashion stores, both chain brands & boutique stores. The side streets & streets that run behind the fashion shops contains lots of cafés, restaurants & art boutiques. High quality shopping area with restaurants to suit Asian & European tastes. No ""junk food"" outlets here. It's all class, style & chic."
"Pretty street, nice cafes","This was a nice pretty place to walk around. There are many pleasant cafes. It was very cold in December though, I think it's nicer to walk around here when it's not winter, Seoul winters are extremely cold."
Gives you the cosy and trendy feeling,"I came here to check out the rows of ginkgo trees in autumn. Sadly it was not yet peak foliage when I visited in late October. But I still enjoy walking along Garosu-gil, looking at the small shops, each with its unique deco. The rows of ginkgo trees are still lovely - only that the leaves are still green. I saw many young and trendy Koreans shop here. You can just sit in a cafe and watch people in trendy outfits - like a fashion show on the street. To get here, take line 3 to Sinsa Station (Exit 8). If you have time, yes you should come here to see a different Seoul (unlike hongdae, myeongdong, edae or even apgujeong)."
"Must Go for Fab Dining, Shopping and Hanging Out","This street is not only pretty, but the another neighborhood is filled with small specialty restaurants, coffee/cake shops, fashion boutiques with a wide variety of local merchandise at different price range. So anyone can find something you like and can afford here. This is one of the most trendy and hip district I've been too. You will never get tired of this place. We have tried several restaurants there and we loved them all. We particularly liked a green bistro called April Market on the side street, we had the best flat bread and an angel hair pasta there!! If you only have 1 day in Seoul and you want to dine, shop till you drop. This is the place to be."
Hip shopping,"Good place to shop along a pretty ginkgo tree-lined street. This street must be extra beautiful when autumn sets in and the ginkgo leaves turn into fiery red. Garosu-gil has nice cafes and boutiques. Do take time to wander around the backstreets because there were plenty of interesting corners to see. Oh yes, since it's an upscale shopping area, be ready to spend more money than you should have (a small cup of fresh orange juice from Coffee Bean & Tea Leaves, set me back around KRW80,000)."
Trendy yet laid back,"Considered the ""cheaper"" version of Apgujeong, Garosugil is the place for younger, trendy crowds and those who wants to see and be seen. Has tons of artsy cafes and stores ranging from the usual fashion house (Forever 21, H&M) to those one of a kind vintage boutiques (9 Owls, Maki). There's an awesome small restaurant/cafe called Table Star (turn right after Smile Market, it will be on the left) which has a superb lunch set for only ₩12,000 that includes a salad, fries, a main course and a drink. Really delicious and worth it, we had to come back a few days later. The lunch set is only available weekdays but their other menu options are great too.Definitely worth going as it is such a laid back place and it's a pleasure just walking around. Be sure to explore the little alleys as that is where most of the gems are."
Shop in style and peace.,This is a good place to shop if you want to avoid the uncouth and loud tourist (from you-know-where) that plague Myeongdong and DFS. No peasants shouting from 1 end of the street to another and no rude interruptions when a salesperson attends to you.
a place to be 'seen'...,"a place where u dress up and be ""seen""...... a trendy street lined with artsy cafes and little boutiques."
Trendy hangout,"When you are tired of the mall experience and the accompanying kpop blasting stereos and florescent Korean fashion, head to Garosugil for some difference.Here you get fashion items that are eclectic and trendy. There are a couple of vintage stores on the underground level too. Things aren't the cheapest around, but surely much nicer than what you get at the malls.Then stop by for tea or coffee at one of the many nice, um, Aussie inspired cafes? Definitely worth a visit."
Trendy,"Garosu-gil is a trendy road filled with name brand shopping and Seoul's beloved coffee shops. I'm not big on the shopping, but it was a nice late evening stroll. For food, we went slightly off the beaten path and found a fantastic little restaurant in one of the off-shoot alleyways. I feel like it's hard to go wrong in Seoul—just look for the restaurants that look packed with locals. And on your way back to the subway station, see if you can count all the plastic surgery buildings."
The new street for new restaurants.,"Find all the mediocre western food, japanese food, and cafes, with parking that is difficult. This is a hot spot right now for the crowds in the mid-20's and early 30's. It is a common date spot for Koreans, but food wise nothing has been exceptional, but some are pretty good. Nice little cafes and places to stop and relax during the day time and would recommend a walk down at least once if you are visiting and have the time."
Awesome!,"See another side of Seoul instead of just going to tourist hyper shopping places. Garosugil allows you to see how the local lives and shops. It's a nice street and you may catch a glimpse of models or celebrities here. You can find local desingers' shops here with affordable prices. I enjoyed the atmosphere here a lot. Btw, I saw Running Man shooting too when i was there. Couldn't hide my excitement!"
Awesome fantastic street to be on..,"By Just walking on the street and looking at celebrities of Korea or foreign models, you will never get bored!! A bunch of fun stores with eccentric and brilliant ideas! I just loved this street and beautiful cafes!"
High-end street! ,"Shop, eat, drink! All for you! Bistro, cafe, boutique, restaurant... You can also find 'hidden' shops, cafe and restaurant behind the main street! Do walk around and you will find surprises! And the price too! There have many kind of cuisines for you to choose as well."
Seoul's Vancouver's Robson Street,"This reminded me so much of Vancouver's Robson Street. A tree lined avenue of various buildings, all unique and interesting, at least superficially. If I am a Seoulite of some means I would likely enjoy hanging out here at the cafes and european influenced restos and boutiques.Lots of fashion, nice bites and beautiful people watching here. It's comfortable and quiet, away from the masses scrambling at Dongdaemun for a scarf or jacket. Of course, I'd never be seen there, plus there's no place to park my BMW. I'd prefer to have a nice French meal followed by espresso and pastries. But since I'm not a local nor of any great means, you'll more likely find me down at Gwangjang Market chewing on a pig's food, drinking makgeolli from a paper cup."
Trendy shops and restaurants alongside roadside stalls.,"It was about 4pm when I reached Garosu-gil expecting an exclusive shopping area. To my surprise, there were many roadside stalls selling fashion accessories. However, there's a handbag museum that's worth a visit."
We went back twice,I like this area because the area is quieter than the others. You can shop comfortablly. There are not restaurant & bar.The pricing of everything seems to be fair. However do not expect very cheap products for sale.
good shopping district,"a must visit district in seoul, located southern part of seoul at Gangnam area, lots of cafe, restaurant, boutique.. near to subway sinsa station or apgujeong station."
"Trendy, Cool, Artsy, Shopping, Cafes, Food.","The title just about sums up Garosugil...very popular with the trendy, cool, young, fashionable local crowd.
