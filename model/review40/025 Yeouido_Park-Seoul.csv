Lovely park to chill,"Visited in spring and trees were very beautiful. There were many locals and hardly any tourists. My boyfriend and I rented bikes and unexpectedly cycled pass Han river (if i'm not wrong). Overall the park is a 10/10 to me. Spring weather was great, pet-friendly park, picnics and even sports facilities like tennis courts. Managed to catch some live music performance well."
Peaceful parkland in heart of Seoul,"Site of the previous Yeouido Airport until the 1960's, then converted to parkland in the 1990's (includes a static C-47 as a reminder). Best for walking, jogging, cycling, basketball or just sitting enjoying the surrounds. Lots of amenities available. Underpass links to Hangang Park at North East end."
It's okay,"The Yeouido park is okay, nothing very special. I think most reviewers are confusing it with Yeouido Hangang park."
Spring,Alot of trees but alot of people as well.. You can sit in the park with a mat and some food to have a relaxing picnic
awesome cherry blossom viewing,"We came around 7.30 am and it's not crowded. We had a great time admiring cherry blossom, it's so good to take photos of it at early morning. "
Beautiful park with Sakura,"Visit the park on Apr 3, Sakura almost get flower, nearby the main river of Seoul. Easy to have beautiful pictures"
Second Visit Like First Time,"My second time actually visiting Yeouido but it feels like the first time because last time was autumn. I went there alone so I didnt rent a tent, ordered a chicken so I guess I missed something big but at least I got to observe how they celebrate Spring Festival. And the cherry blossoms are just as lovely as the people."
Nice place for a stroll,"Do pop by if you are nearby, otherwise I don't think it's worth it to come here. Went when cherry blossoms were in bloom, but there are many other places to view cherry blossoms as well. Overall a nice place for a stroll but only if you are nearby."
Beautiful area to enjoy Spring and relaxing,"This park and area are famous within the locals and tourist. Especially when I came here during cherry blossom season, better to come early to enjoy cherry blossom. This area is quite large. Can enjoy the city view, hangang river, nice weather, and picnics with your friends. I walk more further from Yeouido Hangang Park to see cherry blossom and i found the area that is really beautiful and enjoyable. Also there are some street food stall near the park. I love to spend some time here to relaxing my soul. And I think, during sunset time will be nice too even we can't see the sunset from this park."
Busy Park on 1st of April,"The park is very busy when we were there on the 1st of April. It was supposed to be the start of cherry blossom festival but only a few of the trees are blossoming.This park is where the Eland Cruise terminal is located that cruises along the Han river.Tip: To get to this park, take Yeouinaro line 5 and exit through exits 2 or 3"
Cherry Blossom Night View ,"A night walk after dinner around Yeouido park ~Wonderful place with nice cherry blossom view , cooling surrounding and nice scenery view!Lucky me ☺️ there are full of cherry blossom and drama/movie taking just around it ~ Running man Jeon so-min just finish her part and leaving in front of me ~ so regret that I can’t had a chance to take photograph with her "
Only one fully blooming sakura on early april 2019,I went there on 3apr2019.. the weather still around 9 to 10 degree celcius in yeouido hangang park And the flowers still hadnt fully blooming yet
One of must visits of cherry blossom,"Along the Yeouido street, full of cherry blossom. best time to visit about first week of april. better to check schedule first. "
Better to avoid cherry blossoms on weekends,"This is a huge park in Yeouido.One of the best parks to ride a bicycle in Seoul. And REALLY famous for cherry blossoms. So, if you don't want to mess with crowds, stay away on cherry blossom weekends."
visit,good place to see river view and can breathe fresh air. can see so many beautiful places from there.
Sukura Season,"It must be the most beautiful season when we visited the park, walking along the river bank was looked like passing a sukura flower tunnel. It was still a little bit cold for us who were from the warm Southwest China. There were also lots of local specialty street vendors."
Great walk in the park in the busy district,It was so nice to have this quietness in the middle of the busy district life. The sunshine made it spectacular!
A kind of Central Park in Seoul,"Visit this park, adjacent to the Han river and a new business and shopping district. Close to IFC underground shopping mall."
Yeouido park,"Been here many times with my friends.You can do a lot of things with friends and families. Celebrating birthdays here, picnic, camping, riding a boat and bicycle and so on....also many beautiful view for sight seeing.In spring time there's a cherry blossom. in summer time there's a water park.So its a great and recommendable park."
nice,"nice park to walk, i went there with the cherry blossom festival and i was in love with all the flowers"
Stroll and camp,"Great place to stroll for the night. There are available seats, and there's also the entire park where you can camp. Great view at night."
Nice park to strolling around!,"Went here just to strolling around. The park was so nicely build and taken care of. So clean and the surrrounding was so peaceful eventhough it is in the middle of the buzzling city. You can try to bring your lunch here (get it in the nearest convenient store) then sit down in the park, enjoy!"
Lot of sakura,"yeouido park would be a difference if you visit at the different season, the best season is spring! you can just seat on the grass, feel the spring breeze, cycling, picnic. during the spring, the park is so beautiful. note, sometimes, even tho it is spring, the weather still has no different from the winter. make sure, you check the forecast before you come. if you get out from the yeouido station, you still has to walk about 300m to the park. i usually get down at sindorim station and then get the bus straight to the yeoido park. or you can get down to yeouinaru station"
Nice,"I was planning to visit Seonyudo Park but was recommended by a Korean Friend to visit this instead. This park didn’t disappoint, the river view was nice on a bright sunny day. I hear the night view is amazing too but wasn’t there in the evening. There were many families having picnics along the stream and so nice to watch all the kids running around. I rented a bike for an hour (3000krw) so there isn’t a need to walk that much. According to a Friend, eating cup noodles is a Korean thing to do at Yeouido park where there are instant cooking stands at the shops. I didn’t try it since it was still pretty hot in summer but I can imagine it’d be nice to have some hot noodles here when the weather is chilly."
must see in sakura season,"if you live nearby this park in cherry blossom season then do not skip this place. it was really beautiful visit during March/April this year (2018). enjoyed the beautiful trees. it looks more beautiful in nature than it look in pictures. no much things to do. just for walking and relaxing with family. there is a small market for quick bite. also, there is a huge open yard for playing around. also, there is a street nearby full of cherry blossom trees. i loved it during this season. other seasons i am not sure how it looks."
Wonderful green oasis in the concrete jungle,"I swear by Yeouido Park because it has .. LAWNS!! These are very rare in central Seoul, but at Yeouido Park you can spread out a blanket and have a picnic in several spots. Even more, you can ride a bike along the shady perimeter circular route (or walk/jog if that's your thing). It's squeaky clean, has lots of big old trees for shade, and miraculously keeps out most of the car noise from the outside world. Once you get in to this rectangular little oasis, you really get refreshed. "
Rent a Bike,A few friends and I decided to see what Korean parks would be like and came out here for a quick visit. This park is much larger than it seems so rent a bike or even roller skates (there are places in the park to rent them) and tour around leisurely and enjoy the sights. I think it'll be nice for family with kids too! NOTE: I was here in the late summertime so it was hot that I didn't go too far but I heard in the springtime the cherry blossoms are beautiful.
Cherry Blossom is the main reason to visity,I have been searching many place to see the cherry blossom. it was such a nice place to see cherry blossom there.
Yes during cherry blossoms season!,"We visited Korea during the cherry blossoms seasons and went to Yeouido park to visit the cherry blossoms festival. It was great. I guess at any other period of the year this would just be a regular a bit boring park (even if you get a good view of downtown seoul from there), but during the cherry blossoms it was the best! so beautiful!"
Best place to unwind,"If you're traveling to take a break from your busy days, definitely visit this place. Bring a picnic mat or rent one, they also have tent rentals around if you're going on a big party. Get some food, head to the one and only Ministop inside the park for some ramyon and drink and ice cream and all of those good stuffs, or if you have a company who speaks Korean, order a chicken delivery. Just sitting there for a while feels really great, and sometimes they have performances, water sports, and everything else that are entertaining. Bonus: they have a beautiful illumination at night, I don't know if it's during Spring or the entire year, but it'll be great to check out."
Visit during cherry blossom,We visited during cherry blossom and lived the view.Superly crowded.recommended place at cherry blossom time.
Nice to take a break from the city bustle ,"Went here on a whim. Enjoyed the 2 hours spent here laying on the ground. Could’ve rented a bike but didn’t wanna rush to return it after. It’s such a nice park, teenagers and couples come here to have a picnic and watch the sun sets. It’s really nice "
Yeouido Park,"Nice park to have rest from huge city. Easily accessible by public transport. Facilities like restroom are available, food and drink also possible to find. Better to visit on a warm day."
"Very lovely park, rent a bike!","Lovely park near Financial district (I believe); my husband and I rented a tandem and drove around, so much fun! Lots to see, really lovely park. Don't miss when in the area!"
Beautiful Park with Cherry Blossoms,"We visited Seoul in April this year to mainly watch cherry blossoms at this park. The park is beautiful and large. There are many things to see in this park, including hundreds of cherry trees in the park, as well as on the streets circling the park.Even if we missed the Spring Flower Festival (being deferred to later days) when we were there in the first week of April, we enjoyed our walk around the park. We also enjoyed the walk along the Han River next to the park. The walk is lined with many street vendors selling local foods."
Yeouido Spring Flower Festival,We were there for the Spring Flower Festival. It's quite crowded and there're performance on the street.Walking along the park with this beautiful scene is very relaxing. We aligned at National Assembly Station and took a short walk to the park.
Great Park!,I visited this small park at the height of the Cherry Blossom bloom season in early April. It was especially beautiful at this time. The center of the park has a skate park and basketball courts and were filled with people enjoying the early spring weather. The outer edge of the park is a long walking path that passes under cherry blossom trees. A nice 30 minute stroll!
Beautiful Cherry Blossoms!,Great place to view cherry blossoms as the road is lined with thousands of cherry trees on either side. We visited one day before the festival started and could drive through the entire stretch. Excellent place to enjoy cherry blossoms in Seoul.
More restaurants near National Assembly station,"4 subway stations are around Yeouido-dong. More restaurants, cafe can be found at the road side ""Gukhoe-daero 68/70-gil"" near the National Assembly station. The atmosphere on weekdays and weekend are different. But restaurants many closed on Sunday.Travel around early to mid-April is the best Cherry Blossom season at Seoul. Yeouido Park is one of the most popular destinations for viewing cherry blossoms. Recommended to travel during the cherry blossom festival at night time."
Sea of Flowers,9 April onwards is the time where the Cherry blossoms flowers bloom. Should last about a week to 9 days. It is a great place to see in Seoul. Take a subway to National Assembly station line 9. Walk through the National Assembly for about 7 minutes. You will reach the park along the lake.
Nice park,"Nice park, large playground at central Plaza then followed by a nice stroll along lush of greens and trees, also flowers. You don't feel your are in the city center."
Yeouido Cherry Blossoms Festival,"Many cherry blossom trees are planted on the bank surrounding Yeouido. Every spring cherry blossoms burst their flower bud. Yeouido Cherry Blossoms Festival is being held from April 7. to 12 this year. The Elementary Local Self-Government, Youngdeungpo-Gu is providing many programs. Although I know the bank surrounding Yeouido is called Yoon Joong-Ro, I write just a review about Yeouido Park because the bank surrounding Yeouido can't be searched exactly."
Best time when cherry blossom festival,"Lucky me when come here in 1st week of April 2018 when all the street corner is full of cherry blossom and there is a cherry blossom festival in the park, to get here bu subway you can pick line 5 (purple line subway) and stop at the Yeouinaru station (527) subway...there are some streetfood corner if you are hungry after taking a walk and you can also have a dinner or lunch at the cruise near the river at Yeouido park"
Cherry Blossom ,"Best time to go today or this week, sunny days. Nice weather. Lots of Cherry Blossom. Most are white colour, only few are pink "
Casual and relax time ,Good place to relax and spent with kid. Bicycle rental is available and few stall of street food available. 
A great option for walking or biking nearby,A fairly calm place to spend an afternoon. There are food options nearby and it is comfortable with the breeze coming off the Han river. Many families come here with their young kids and there is a campsite there for some festivals. A place for many locals to come and unwind. This park is also popular among teenagers during the weekend. When the weather is warmer the smell of bar-barque is in the air.
Great for walking.,Been is Yeouido for more than a month give me the opportunity to walk this park almost every day. Is really grat in summer. But if you are in autumn/winter be sure to have a sweater with you can get really windy some times. You can rent a bike and enjoy a ride around the park
"Park, frozen pond, playground ","This park has a lot of facilities, not only for kids but also for adults and seniors. We visited this park on cold sunny day.This park was nice enough to walk around. The pond was frozen with leaves in it. In the middle of the park, there was King Sejong statue. "
Cherry Blossom Park,"Best way to catch the cherry blossom in full bloom would be to check the forecasts that are readily available on social media. We came mid week of April and caught the remaining of it. Best to come at its peak when all the trees are blooming. Late March or early April is a good time. Or check the official Spring season and give it a week to give time for the flowers to bloom.Some wild blossoms may also be seen in Gyeongbukgong and Changdokgung palaces.Visited the park on a weekend and it was packed! Everyone, both tourists and local come here to see the cherry blossoms so get ready for huge crowds on those days."
I Seoul U,"You can find the I Seoul U sign here. It's in the middle of an open area so it's not hard to miss. And, it's right by the river, so you get an amazing view of the water and of Seoul! Also, there are grassy areas to lay in and benches to sit on to enjoy the view."
best place to see cherry blossoms,"Yeouido park is super crowded during cherry blossoms period from early to mid April. There are more cherry blossom trees here than any other places in Seoul, that's why this is number 1 spot. Cherry blossoms are lined up along 1 km road. I visited in mid April 2017 when cherry blossoms at Seoul forest park, Kyungyee university, Namsan park and Seokchon lake were way beyond their peak. Yeouido park was still beautiful."
Rent a bike and ride,Long scenic bike ride near the lake. Lots of space for walking too. Numerous rest stops. Can get good views of the rivers and bridges. Loved this area. 
My favorite public park,"Not just my favorite park in Seoul, but my all time favorite. Better than Golden Gate Park in San Francisco (though it is much bigger). And New York Central Park can't even compare. I say this mainly because this park is keep very clean and in great condition. Lots of beautiful views and connecting to Han Park as well.April is the best time because of the cheery blossom trees blooming. The last time we were here, it was April, but really crowded because everyone else wants to come see the beautiful views. It is also a time of year when it is not hot and humid.There are places along the way where you can buy some drinks and snacks, and you will see many people on rented bicycles. Some locals bring their bikes. We have never seemed to have trouble parking. There is a fee in most areas at the park, but I consider it cheap.Just plain to spend a whole day there and have a picnic."
Rent a bike and take in the serene scenery!,"My daughters and I rented bikes on a cool Autumn morning, just as the leaved started changing. 9000 won for 3 bikes for an hour (tandem bikes are also available). It was money well spent! It was so lovely to bike around the park! The bike track is flat and suitable for all levels. It was so peaceful and relaxing. You could stop along the way and take in some of the gorgeous scenery. There are also 2 little cafes in the park if you feel like a snack. Highly recommended!Just note that to rent bikes you will need to present one piece of ID (e.g. passport). "
Beautiful park. Very clean and seating throughout.,"A haven in the midst of the city. Beautiful green space, well cared for and clean. Good place to chill out, read a book or just people watch."
Lovely for a bike ride,"Most Koreans seem to come here to set-up their tents and to enjoy their loved ones, which is an interesting happening to watch in itself. However, I chose to make a small bike ride circling the island. Lots of stuff to see underway and nice break-away from the busy city life!"
sakura bloom,it was so packed when i went here at Spring season.even though is not holiday but even the local people gather in here.Bloom everywhere!!! (human and flower) 
Best show in town to catch the cherry blossoms in their full splendor,"We specifically chose to visit Korea in the spring so we could catch the famous cherry blossoms in their full splendor, a decision that paid amazing dividends. With our son and daughter-in-law living in Korea, we were fortunate to have the best guides show us the best things Korea has to offer. We made it a whole day event, and luckily, we had the best weather for a long and pleasant walk through the park. The welcoming scenery was incredible! We've seen Washington DC during the cherry blossom season, and although it is a experience to cherish, Yeouido Park will by far always be second to none. What a magnificent site! We got there during the peak time and every tree and every bush was covered in blossoms. Pinks galore, whites and other colors were a true feast for our eyes. We chose to get a map, which you can pick up at the entrance, so we could find our way around. It was so wonderful to see how Koreans truly make use of such a stunning facility, we saw hundreds of local residents in sports attire taking to the numerous trails around the park. They obviously love to hike and enjoy the outdoor, and th. Are with which park official manage the park ought to be applauded. The park is very clean, it's kept in the most amazing condition, there are all kind of facilities throughout, clean restrooms in multiple spots, and even food stands to pick up light snacks. This was truly a wonderful day and the experience will last a life time. Beautiful park! We went in April, so be sure to take a light jacket or sweater, temperature can change rather quickly, so be pr pared. There are excellent sidewalks and flat parkways for parents pushing strollers, this is a great choice for families to visit. The park is huge!"
Nice sized park with many options,"This is a big park with many options within and around. You can rent a bike or inline skates to ride around, or just stroll around. There are nice restaurants next to the KBS building, or across the big road in IFC and around. You can buy snacks and beverages inside the park too.The park is linked to Han River park, and it is also a great park with even wider options. You can do water sports, ride a sightseeing ship, play at a shallow water fountain. Great for young kids. "
A must visit place ,"There are so many activities here. So you can try anything to spend you time. Also, running man also shot here few times!"
Great place to take a walk,There are a couple of decent photo ops here. It's a great place to take a break from the city. It's a pretty quiet park considering it's not that large and in the middle of the city. 
I love Seoul sign nearby,The park is pleasant to wander around and towards the river and past the bridge on the right you will find the photogenic I Love Seoul sign. Nearest metro station Yeouinaru on Line 5.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
Its not a park filled with Cherry blossoms but a wonderful open park,"we had gone to Yeouido park to see the Cherry blossoms. we were slightly disappointed , there were far too many people on the street where the cherry blossoms were. The street was also a main road. Every picture i took of the cherry blossoms had 50 other people in it. there was unfortunately also too many street stalls on the road side which detracted from any beautiful shot of the cherry blossoms. . if you want cherry blossoms, then do the homework again or go to the Busan Jinhae cherry blossoms festival. its better there. one location has a small stream surrounded by cherry blossoms on both banks. or go to the unused railway station to see cherry blossom trees on both sides . by the way cherry blossoms only flower for a week. come too early and you see a few, come too late and you see no cherry blossoms. here is a tip , look up the ' korea cherry blossom forecast ' published from February to early march. Yeouido park though is a lovely open space to have a picnic and see the river. or to catch a river cruise up the Han river. "
Worth to visit,"Even when the cherry blossom season is past, it is worth to go for a morning or evening leisure stroll (or rent a bike). "
A pretty relaxing place,"After visiting the quite nice Yeouido Hangang Park we checked out this park here. We missed Cherry blossom season by only a few days....but it was a pleasant walk here anyways.There's a good number of different walks, lanes and bike roads. We were here on a weekday and it was very relaxing. Only a few - mostly local - visitors. Nice and quiet. Good to catch a breath after visiting the busy downtown area.There's a big field quite in the middle of the park, a Statue of King Sejong the Great, several playgrounds, a coffee shop and lots of nice little spots with benches. A very nice place was at the pond with the pavillon (check the pic). For a moment you woulnd't have thought you're still in Seoul.A nice park, maybe not worth visiting just for itself, but if you also check out the nearby Hangang Park it's definitely worth a trip.Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
The most amazing urban park!,"With many theme-based sections, this park has so much to see. And while you're in each section you'll feel secluded enough like you're in a separate park each time. We went walking through the park from 9 - 11pm and it was wonderous. The night time views were magical as we ended by the river front. It felt extremely safe late on a Saturday night and lots of people were still out and about, even after midnight when we made our way back to our guesthouse via subway which closes by midnight. This midnight park visit was really a gem from my first visit to Seoul."
great place to chill with friends.,this place is mostly famous for its cherry blossoms. if you visit this place in the beginning to spring you will be able to see the beautiful cherry blossoms tree and it is just amazing.
Beautiful Flowers,It's a breeze to walk through this park. Filled with so many beautiful bright flowers. I wished I could have seen the Cherry Blossom. Peaceful area to have a jog or cycle around 
Most enjoyable,The park has four distinct areas. Some lovely trees and shrubs. Missed tge cherry blossom sadly. A good place to people watch Korean families enjoying a day out. Watch out for the very dramatic sculpture.
Average Park,Not recommended if it's not cherry blossom season. Just a normal park where people are doing exercise. 
Great visit with the family,"We went here as a family during the cherry blossom season and the views/photos were spectacular. This is reasonably close to the Han River and the ""I Seoul You"" sign. Enjoy!"
cherry blossoms,visited during cherry blossom season it was so beautiful with endless cherry trees! it was very crowded but worth the visit :)
The Korean Central Park !,The Korean Central Park ! This place is on the middle of the Yeouido business tower. The park is really quite and clean. You have some beautiful view and also many birds and fish !
Popular forest park near the Han river,"This park is beautiful in spring. We visited because we heard it was a great place to see the cherry trees in blossom and it was. Many people strolling and picnicking, statues, varieties of gardens and forests. Bikes are for hire, and the shore of the river was being enjoyed by many. We then walked to the Mapo bridge and saw all the messages on the bridge."
汝矣島公園,"It was expected to see the earlysprig flower as there was many promotion of it and banner everywhere in the station.However, though I went there on the second or third day of the season mentioned in the banner but not much flower blossomed. What a pity. It must be romantic and a nice place for couples and family to enjoy the blossom of cherry"
Rows of Cherry Trees,We were lucky to go here and witness the full bloom of Cherry Blossom Trees. There are rows and rows of cherry trees in this area but a bit tricky if you will go there for a cherry blossom viewing as the blooming of the trees last only 10 days a year. Go here in the morning as beginning lunchtime - lots of people are in the street / park. 
Cherry Blossom Walk,"Depending on what you are looking for. This park is for many things or activities. Walking, running, cycling & other activities. It is along the Han River and surrounding the Parliament House.Try to go to the park in the early morning or evening. If intend to take photo of the cherry blossom, then it is best early morning with a quiet walking path without people to have a nice shooting."
Do visit during Cherry Blossom Festival,"Went here after being so excited about cherry blossoms. As many people know these flowers only bloom 2 weeks within a year and many celebrate as they are gorgeous. Korean loves their cherry blossom, not as much as Japanese do, but the trend is increasing. In this park, do find the atrium and there will be many families, couples, friends playing here. From bicycle, rollers to scooters. You can rent easily but not for very small children. During the festival there are many food stalls and activities, so within these 2 weeks you'll get culture, happenings trends and current local favorites. Since the event is outdoor do prepare umbrella as early April (when the flowers bloom) means there's rain every now and then and the temperature is still chilly. Best to visit anytime of the day but we do love afternoon as somehow it was more romantic."
cherry blossom,yes we love the night lights of the trees with the cool weather and safe to walk by ourselves or by group
Sprin in bloom at the street,The Cherry Blossom trees surrounded the street and its so mesmerizing to view with. The tourists were crowding to have their best spot for selfies and picture taking.
too crowded in weekends and especially at spring festival,"when i gone here it was sunday and the spring festival was going on that day, that might be the reason why there is people packed around the park and beside the river. i get there by subway and it seem like all off the passengers was going to the this place...really2 crowded with people cycling, families were picnic in the park, children playing kites, couples walking around or just enjoying the breeze (its still windy and pretty cold), group of teens taking selca, ahjumma selling things.if you prefer place that not too crowded, i recommend you to go there at weekdays. the cherry blossom was not as many as at jinhae / yonggungsa too... "
Beautiful in the Spring!,"Definitely worth a visit if you're in Seoul around early to mid-April. The cherry blossom trees are in bloom and they're very beautiful. The park gets really crowded, especially on weekends. Bikes are available to rent and you can ride them on the track around the park."
Yeouido Flower Festival,"Went for Yeouido Flower Festival, during the festival there is lots of performance going on here. One of the best place to see cherry blossom if you missed Jinhae. The park is big thus required lots of walking if u want to cover the whole park."
Beautiful park,"A beautiful park in the middle of the city. I visited Yeouido Park in spring 2017. There were beautiful cherry blossoms everywhere. You can go for walks, rent a bike or skate through the park. My husband and I rented a tandem bike and we found that it's the best way to get around the park. We managed to cover the entire park in a short time and it was not tiring either. The park facilities were also very good - there were a lot of public toilets around the area. You may also find the King Sejong statue at this park."
Lovely and Beautiful,This is best to go to during Sakura/Cherry Blossom season because there was nothing much to see after that.
Very average,"Very busy during weekends and in all honesty I don't think it's that great. Sure, it's nice to see the cherry blossoms but there aren't many trees. I'd suggest walking near the river or having a picknick in a nearby park instead."
Great,I came here when the cherry blossoms are blooming. Awesome. Very beautiful. So many young and old people walked around here. The park is the best place to refresh your mind after you got a long hard working time. 
A fine place for a long walk among the local folks,"We happened to be in town during Cherry Blossom festival which no doubt added to the crowds (which were not bothersome at all) but I enjoyed a long walk in the park. Lots of beautiful flowers and lots of local folks taking in the sites, especially families. Its a great way to unwind and get some exercise. Urban building backdrop with nice natural scenery, local flavor you can bike and skate too"
Yeouido,"This is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful parks in all Seoul! Nice view of the River! The 63 building and the National Assembly are right here too, i love this area"
Beautiful flowers and great view of the Han,"Visited during Cherry Blossom season and it was beautiful, everyone out enjoying a pretty afternoon. There are street vendors with all kinds of food off the grill along the street, and people camped and walking everywhere. The I Seoul U installation by the river is a great place for photos on a clear day. Easy walk from the subway stop."
Sightseeing at Yeouido Park,The park is around 500 m from Yeouido subway station. It is very nice place to walk and jogging. You can rent bicycle to go around the park.
Cherry blossom festival,"We walked the area to view blossoming trees but the week we were there only a few trees were in bloom. The blossoms came out the week after we were there. The trees in bloom were beautiful, as well as many other flowering bushes."
Good place but......,"i love this place too.Very nice organised park.We rented a bicycle and cycle around the park.But on my visiting day, the flower has not fully bloom.......:("
"beautiful park, great blossoms","wow what a park, right next to hotel, and full of blossom, willow trees, pretty spots to take images......really nice, wishec i can live there!"
Still early for cherry blossoms,Went to this park on 3rd April with hopes to see cherry blossoms however only a handful of trees have bloomed. There were pretty flowers around and a nice small playground. A nice park for a stroll.
Nice Cherry Blossom,Went to this park in April during cherry blossom period... very good and beautiful cherry bloom :) really has a great feeling and i really enjoy it very much ;) It a MUST GO/SEE during cherry blossom period 
Nice place for strolling,"Most beautiful during spring when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. A nice park, where a lot of activities going on at all time of the day. Connected to the Hangang so visitors could enjoy the view of the river as well."
Beuautiful,Don't forget to take the picture as you can see there are so many trees there. I love the scenery and it was good to have picnic there.
beautiful place with so many tree,"We been here in March it was so nice and so many international tourists and domestic, nice whether and feel loving all tree around. There is no entrance fee and well management, must visit"
Winters day,"For a winters day the park was quite lively, probably because if the ice skating that had been setup. Lots of families around and people walking the park circuit. "
Come here for an outdoor icepark ,"On its own island on the Han River, the train ride from Seoul Central was less than 20 minutes for you to enjoy outdoor skating and sled. Great for kids to let go steam in the middle of winter"
Snowing~,"Visited the park during early winter. There was even ice skating rink ! However, if you're going at the period with no snow and no cherry blossom, I'll totally skip this park in my itinerary."
Cherry blossoms!,"I visited here with a friend in April to check out all the pretty cherry blossoms. However, it was very hard to find parking and it was crowded with local people. Before I was able to enjoy all the cherry blossoms, I was blocked my people and street food carts that were everywhere. It was not visually pleasing to see all these street carts under the beautiful cherry blossom trees. I couldn't take a decent picture because there would be trash and street carts in the background. :( Due to the street food, trashes were everywhere and it was hard to even find a trashcan. I enjoyed seeing the cherry blossoms but I don't think this is the best place to visit if you are just there to see flowers. We ended up leaving within an hour...=("
cherry blossoms,We were lucky to have visited the park when the cherry blossoms are still in bloom. It was not as crowded as I have expected because it was early and a weekday probably. It's a nice place to walk around or stay for an afternoon picnic with your friends/family.
Lovely park,"Yeouido Park is a big park with nice scenery. Rented a bicycle and cycle along Hangang River. To go here, take subway to Yeouido Station (Line 9) Exit #4."
Lovely urban park ,"It's a very nice strip of park flanked by office buildings. Kudos to City planners for putting greens to de-stress urban dwellers. It's early winter....and the autumn Colours can still be seen, though trees are drying up! Lots of birds flying and chirping away! There's even a pond with a pavilion in the center of the park. Lovely to see dogs being walked by owners too! I happened to be in the precinct, waiting for the hourly bus from Youido Full Gospel Church to Osanri Jori-Myeon, Pajua. Having just missed the bus, I had a whole hour to explore this park. "
Amazing good walking at autumn ,"Feel so goodI walk there at Thursday afternoon And no more touristOnly few local people I'm so glad can walk there I been at spring So different view from this two weather Suggest anyone should come here walk with your friend or bf/gfActually there was a big big parkSo different way at the different partIf want walk finish all the park way here ,thinking takes your time around 3hours , also you can rent at bike here , so nice biking here or running here 很漂亮的地方，我跟好友在下午來到這邊，沒有什麼觀光客，非常舒服，走在這裡幾乎忘了時間，帶杯咖啡來好好漫步，就像你ㄕㄥˉㄏㄨㄛˊ在這裡一樣"
Nice park if you are in the area,"I was staying in the area, and it was a very nice park in the late autumn, great fall colors and quite paths. Has a jogging track and walking paths, little ponds and grassy knolls. In the south there's a large paved area with basketball courts and other activities."
The perfect place to spend your lunch break at,"It's a huge park with several entrances, but don't worry, there's a map at every gate, so you always know where you are, or head in which direction if you are looking for a specific place, like the KBS building.There are several benches, and the walking course is made up of a special material - I guess, for runners -, so even if you've been walking all day, your feet won't hurt.It's the perfect place to have lunch or reflect on your experiences during your trip. And indeed, you'll find many people, who work in the surrounding buildings relax in the park.There's also a statue of King Sejong the Great, a replica of the one at Gwanghwamun Square, in the park."
best place to visist during autumn in seoul,"Yeouido Park is really beautiful in Autumn. the leaves color so beautiful.from Yeouido Station (Seoul subway), exit 3. just walk straight about 5 minutes. then you will meet the intersection, and the Yeouido Park big-white signage across the road. i walk in the morning. its really refreshing."
"Great Place for a Picnic, Relax and Take Pictures","Yeouido Park is a great place to take great photographs, enjoy the sea breeze, have a picnic or even jog/cycle around. It is also very accessible via the metro (alight at Yeouinaru station, Seoul Subway Line 5)"
Great park,"Taking the line 5, exit 2 or 3 of the Yeouido Naru Station. You can rent the bike for riding, take a walk or jogging with the great Han River view!! Also, you can buy ticket for the tour boat or cruise (12000 krw). "
A nice park with great gardens,A nice park in the middle of the financial area that is worth a visit. Lot of trees and flowers and a few sculptures. Close to the subway station
Nice park to have a picnic,"It's a nice, small park. I recommend going here in the spring for a picnic when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. "
Open space in a crowded area,"Being right in Yeouido, a major financial district, this park is surprisingly large and spacious. It does get a bit crowded when the weather is nice and people are on their lunch breaks. Still, there's lots of open grass, walking paths and other nice distractions like ponds and flowers. There's playgrounds for small kids, too. Easy to get to and right across the street is IFC Mall (which can be accessed by tunnels from the subway station). It's not a highlight of Seoul; it's a place to take a break from the highlights."
Nice park in the middle of the business district,"Have a nice walk in the middle of Seoul's business district, you will see anything from traditional korean forrests to lakes, buildings and statues of founding fathers. You can also exted the walk down to the river for a long walk."
Love the Cherry Blossum,Was lucky to catch a glimpse of the Cheery Blossum. Beautiful park with many locals exercising there. 
"Very much enjoyed the park, but I have a few suggestions?","I didn't know to look for this park and stumbled on it because it was outside my hotel. Still, loved it, and generally got the gist of where I was going by the signage. Still, so much of Seoul has signs in English and Chinese as well as the local language. One nice gift to travelers would be if the bike rentals had a few words of English/Chinese so that travelers could rent bikes, too? "
Rejuvenating afternoon in an awesome park,"We arrived in the park about two hours before sunset and it was amazing! We started the afternoon at the Yeouido metro station, explored a bit towards the river and then walked into and down the park, meandering and finding amazing views and cool features we took about 90min and covered about 2/3 of the park. It's beautiful and peaceful and a definite MUST if you are tired from city attractions. Sunset is also a good time for photos there! "
I love this place!!!,"I went there for cherry blossom!! It was very nice... This place quite far from the subways, but anyways you can walk around 5 mins."
Just a normal park,Good to visit during winter. You can see a lot of people roaming around and great atmosphere I would say. Recommended 
Cherry blossom,"It is where you can the lots cherry blossoms in Seoul. I came here in the second week of the April, so lucky that still have cherry blossom for me. It's the first time to see it. It's so amazing. But I didn't stay long cuz it was so crowded :("
Spring - Sakura Bloom,"During spring all the cherry blossom trees bloom so nicely, it takes a hour or two to walk all the way from one side to another, but also keep it mind that during the blooming season there are so many people, it will be hard to move haha. other than that, it is very nice place to visit and take pictures. On the way there is also some big broadcasting stations, so if you like korean dramas and tv shows, you can take a look around :)"
Wonderful Sakura Festival in Yeouido Park,"I took MRT and went a walk go to here. I found this festival in Korea's information page and wow, very wonderful and beautiful. Many people inside to see and take pic here. Koreans and foreigners very crowed. It's the first time to see sakura, so good feeling!"
Loved the water areas,"Although not too much areas where you can find some shade, the park along Han river is an excellent place to cool off. We liked the swimming areas a lot. Not deep, so safe for the children, but still fun walking down the stream and wading in the pool was fun. The park is big. Bike rental is a good option to explore the entire area. "
The time to come to this place is in the spring,Great time to come to this park is in the Spring during the cherry blossom festival or the putkot festival.
"Relaxing, refreshing",Visited during the cherry blossom festival April 5- 9 2016. Walk among seemingly endless cherry blossom trees along the main road with hordes of people and all kinds of street food on the side.
A good place to spend your free time!,"a very large park with a great view! A lot of things you could do here; relaxing, picnic with your family, spending a great time with your friends. "
Great outdoor park connected to Yeouido Hangang Park,"About:It's a large recreational area located on an island known as Yeouido Island in central part of Seoul and easy access by subway Line no 5. Things to do here:Many cultural events are held here and many outdoor activities to do like bicycling, roller skating and play other sports and that includes for children too. Only Korean traditional trees are planted here and has a Nature Ecosystem Forest. This place is famous for having the loveliest cherry blossom street in Seoul and is a must see. Tips:Hire a bicycle; circle around the park first and then go to Yeouido Hangang Park on it as it's very big and u can Njoy the ride along the river. Best time to go around 3 to 4 pm so you can see both parks at one time and sunset is beautiful over the river. "
Cherry Blossoms!,This is a very nice park with great views! Great nature feel in the city. The Cherry Blossoms are very pretty.
Spending weekend riding bikes,"Good area for relaxing, picnic, running, spending good time with family. Rent bike 3000 won/person for 1 hour. Many places to eat, small shops and take away points."
Nice park,"It's the closest park to my hotel so it becomes my regular morning stroll place. Surprisingly it's quite nice with good trail, views, pond, a Korean garden, food massage stone trail, etc. All of us enjoy so much here."
"Yeouido Hangang River Park, Seoul",The park located along the Hangang River and at the time of our visit was celebrating the Yeouido Cherry Blossom Festival.The cherry blossoms were fantastic to photograph. It's a place where you can just sit down and relax while watching the water and the people going by.
Nice garden for peace of mind,"I was surprised to find a beautiful park in the middle of a busy commercial area. Lots of greenery, fish pond, flower, walking & cycling path, exercise equipments and plenty of seats. The park is open at night and had sufficient lighting. My favourite place to unwind after a long day."
visit during cherry blossom festival,"plenty of cherry trees bloom in late march. definitely worth a visit in that period, i wouldn't know about the rest of the year as there's not much else to do."
Cheery blossom viewing place,"I visit this park mainly to see the cherry blossom. It really is beautiful, but super crowded you cannot take a picture without other people in it."
Garden in a city...,"Came here after our visit to the Hangang Park. Was hoping to see the cherry blossom but can't find any. So we walk in the park, taken some photos and relax there."
Near Glad Hotel,"This was a fun find as I walked around my hotel. Great green area, walking paths and biking paths too. Being from Indiana and a basketball lover, it was fun to see multiple basketball courts full of people playing bball. Lovely spot inside a large city."
Escape the city,We were there at the end of the Cherry Blossom Festival and that itself made the whole experience memorable.
Small traditional-looking park that can be your small escape from the city,"In the heart of Yeouido, you can find this small park that offers a tranquility and korean traditional beauties. Great place for a walk. "
Go during Cherry Blossom season!,"The walk around the park and subsequent avenues during cherry blossom season is like none other. It is full of camera-toting locals and foreigners, couples and elderly, all out for strolls to view the magnificent cherry blossoms in the height of their glory.There are food vendors set up (at least on the weekends) and entertainment such as jugglers, fire sticks (poi) and face painting for kids and adults alike.This is a place to see more selfie sticks than you know what to do with!Highly recommended to see this in early April during cherry blossom time."
Cherry Blossom Season,"I went there during the cherry blossom season and it was very crowded with many tourists and tour bus. Overall, we enjoyed a nice walk under all the beautiful cheery blossom trees. "
Yeouido,"Nice park for a walk, biking or playing in the grass. Across the street is the water area which is an awsome setup but not much shade. Bring an umbrella. Food trucks are where open at 6 along the river. "
Awesome place for family gathering and exercise,"I came here in autumn 2015 for international organ donation awareness program which was held here. I was immediately fascinated by the beauty of this park. The tree were so colorful, the breeze so soft, the air so refreshing. There was so much of different theme area designed or created at the park for everyone of different needs. There was a path for people walking, another path for bicycle. I had a 4 days meeting in Conrad Hotel in front of this park, and everyday I will come here after lunch for a walk. I hope I can come here again in future for cherry blossom."
Such a peaceful and beautiful place,"We went there in the early morning that cherry blossom was all over everywhere. Not much people in the park! we walked along and enjoy the sunshine with those pretty flowers. If you plan to visit Korea in April, Yeouido definitely is one place must go! "
Beautiful green space,Just loved this park. It is surrounded by city... a beautiful green space and is so well used. There are bikes to rent and bike trails as well as paved walking trails. Lots of benches for resting or people watching.
In Search of Cherry Blossoms,"The Park is situated between high-rise buildings. For me, it was a refuge during a stressful day in the city.We went here to see the cherry blossoms. Unfortunately, upon our arrival the weather was sunnier than the previous days. As hopeful as we've always been, we walked from the subway but the trees were already green. It could only be pink, I thought. That's what I saw from my friend's photos just last week. Timidly, we asked a local where the cherry blossoms were, she said it's fallen to the ground-ohhh!Although this is a very nice park to go to but without the cherry blossoms and no time to waste, we could have skipped our visit here in favor of last minute shopping. Lesson learned: ask hotel or a local about things that are dependent on seasons. On the other hand, consider this a good reason to visit Korea again."
Nice park,We went there around 21 April 2016. No more cherry blossom. But we are in for a surprise. Tulips and other flowers. So pretty.
Cherry Blossom!,The only reason to come here is for the Cherry blossom. Visited during the Cherry Blossom Festival which was overwhelm by so many people. Slightly disappointed as to compare with Seokchon Lake.
cherries,"This is where I saw the first cherry blossoms in Korea, there are alleys with cherry trees on each side, very nice place for taking a walk in the nature.Easy to reach via metro."
Perfect for Cherry Blossom viewing,visited during the cherry blossom period - this place is huge with cherry blossoms trees all over the place. Ongoing event during the cherry blossom period which houses food and games stall along the park couple with concerts as well. Very pretty place to take pictures! Can get crowded thou... 
So good!!!,Went there onSunday and it was filled with so many people picnicking in huge groups! Rented a bicycle and took a long bicycle trail enjoying the amazing scenery of the river and flowers! 
Cherry Blossom Festival,"The cherry blossoms last two weeks. We managed to visit the Yeouldo Park in the middle of these two weeks, which the blossom were full and fully open and formed a canopy overhead.There were Korean dancers dancing to traditional Korean music and Korean instruments.There were many food stalls."
Really beautiful Cherry Blossoms,There were rows of Cherry Blossoms trees side by side. We went during on the the last day of the Yeouido Spring Flower Festival. Great experience.
Easy breezy walk,Visited the park mid-April but there was almost no sakuras left... Just a few trees having their last bloom here and there. Nice to just walk around aimlessly or have a picnic. Walked from one end to the other in an hour or so.Further up to the river is also nice for their futuristic looking design/architecture.
Serene and Beautiful,"Took a stroll early on a Sunday morning and enjoyed the park thoroughly. I can see it gets really crowded during peak times on weekends but when I went it was very peaceful. Nice grounds, well marked pathways, running and biking trails and areas for food booths, sports etc. I visited just after the peak cherry blossom season, but still was a great place to escape the frenzy of the big city for a while."
Spring Cherry Blossom Finale,"An excellent place to enjoy the Cherry Blossom bloom. I was there in the midst of the blossom and it was the ""flower rain"" stage, i.e. the petals of the cheery blossom was falling, giving it a ""raining view"" with the scent of the Sakura blossom.Definitely the place to view Cherry Blossom in Seoul!"
Beautiful!,"Needless to say, this is a great park to visit especially during the full bloom of cherry blossom!!!"
Beautiful park on the riverside,"I went during the Cherry Blossom Festival in April and it was spectacular. Lots of people, lots of food, and lots of activities. I can't stress the ""lots of food"" part enough. Food to the left, food to the right, and food everywhere! A lot of different things that you can only get in Korea, so save your stomach and get some food here during the festivals. Out of festival time, the park is a nice walk and a pretty place to visit. if you're looking for a casual nature-ish walk in the city, you should come here and take a look. There are also convenience stores spread out through the park so nothing is ever out of reach if you're hungry or thirsty."
Beautiful cherry blossoms!,The whole park was filled with gorgeous cherry blossoms! So glad we managed to see them in Seoul without having to travel outskirts.The park gets pretty crowded though.
April for Cherry Blossom,Yeouido Ecology Park is great for early Cherry Blossom Observation! The way started from JW Marriott and expand to like 2 miles.
It's just ok,"The park is not so great. Next to the park, near National Assembly there is a street which has trees, in the spring season , the trees will looks nice. But it will be crowded. "
"Rent bikes, eat lots of food, enjoy Hangang Park nearby too","The park is a short walk from the station and I went close to the lunch hour, which proved to be a smart idea as the crowd guided me to the park. Despite being full of people, the park was spacious and well-planned to accommodate the people. Even though bike lanes and people-lanes were separate, people spilled over into all the lanes. Bikes can also go into the park lanes instead of riding around the outer rim. The bike rental store is clearly marked on the park map and the rates were affordable (3000 won for an hour for single bike riders). Bring an article of identity when renting the bike, as the bike store guy will ask for your passport to rent the bike.The park is also close to a section of Hangang park, so you can knock out two parks in one trip."
Sakura and nice Hangan View,Good to visit in April to view Sakura blossoming! A lot of people visit the site yet it would get too crowd. 
Great for viewing cherry blossoms,Along the Han River is a long walk under the cherry trees. It was very invigorating and a beautiful memory with my family.
Another beautiful place to visit and relax ,Yeouido park is a great place to walk around in and a place that I enjoyed for five years frequently as I worked in the area. It's restored nicely and there is so much to enjoy in the area that you must take part of. Get off at Yoinaru station on line five 
The Ultimate Cycling Paradise,"We visisted this beautiful area three or four times, because we just couldn't get enough of it. Coming from a country where cycling lanes are pretty much non-existent and living a mountain area which makes leisure cycling basically impossible we fell in love with this river Park. This is the best place to rent a bicycle and enjoy a long ride. Amazing scenic views, a huge area with lots of paths & lanes. There are two bike rentals. One in the smaller park with cherry trees surrounded by the skyscrapers and one next to the river. The staff adjust the seat for longer european legs (which made them chuckle a bit) and there are different types of bikes you can get. Make sure you have your ID or passport for a safety deposit."
Awesome! E very beautiful park in the center of business district,I think this park is one of the best thing I've seen during my days in Korea. It was very good to see children and families playing in a very tidy space surrounded by the skyscrapers of the business district! I suggest you to spent here one or two hours during your visit in Seoul to take a break from the rest of the city!
My go to place for pics and relaxing,"I just wish I had brought more friends to this place and called for chicken while drinking soju and beer. The sunset here is a sight to be seen on good sky days and this place is among my best memories. Go every so often to see the different flowers blooming. That's one of Seoul's charms, always some kind of natural beauty blooming or falling from the sky, almost every month of the year there's something new"
Beautiful in spring ,Korea is famous for the cherry blossoms between late April and May if you want to see the cherry blossoms this park is the best place to view them. The park is also very large and very accessible by the subway it's close to the Han River and there are restaurants nearby it's a great place to stroll on an afternoon either with family or by yourself. You can also rollerblade skateboard and you can rent bicycles.
Awesome Spring View in Yeouido Park,"Many people are flocking here during spring as the area is filled with cherry blossoms. You will just love walking around, taking pictures here and there. eating the street foods that are available. Sit down a bit and feel the cool air, while the cherry blossom flowers 'rain down' on you. Sounds like a scene of a movie or kdrama :P"
Walk Under a Canopy of Cherry Blossoms,"Our family walked the promenade along the Han River during the April cherry blossom festival. IT was something to see with the canopy of cherry blossoms that are beautiful as anywhere in the world. But beware, it is extremely crowded since everyone else in Seoul seems to decide to walk under the cherry blossoms on the same weekend."
Nothing really special unless you are there to see Cherry blossoms,This park is little old and don't offer much views; it is nice to take a walk but don't recommend as a tourist place. It is nice to see the cherry blossoms during spring but there are always too many people walking around (from countryside of Korea) and honestly It is better to visit Hangang park if you are looking for a break . 
Quiet Park,"We stayed near Yeouido Park, so we decided to went there for a stroll with my son. This park doesn't have many people and is a great place to spend some quiet time there. There is a small playground which our son had fun there."
A haven in the busy city,There are not enough green spaces in Seoul. This was the best I found. A good sized park. Beautiful in autumn sunshine. I will visit this place again for sure 
Great during the cherry blossom festival but a little packed,"Visited in April, and there were many people who had come to see the cherry blossom trees lined along the road during the cherry blossom festival. Also has the view of the river. Great for photo-taking but don't come on a weekend! "
"Great walking, running route","Circular track through beautiful gardens, especially so in autumn. Track is some sort of artificial material,"
Cherry blossoms!,"During our visit, the cherry blossom trees were only starting to bloom. It made for a good walk though."
Beautiful place specially in spring ,In summer it is very cool and relaxing you can rent a bicycle here or go in a boat trip a long the Han river. 
Another Great Park in Seoul,Within walking distances from a number of hotels and businesses in the area. I was in Seoul for a conference at Yeoudio Full Gospel Church and it was great taking a stroll and relaxing in the park after the days activities.
Sports and relaxtion!,"Located in the one of the busiest area sort of business area, you can visit the park relax, watch people moving by, some from office on a break, some sporting. Enjoy the relaxation!"
A nice break,"Yeouido park is a great way to escape the busy world in Seoul. Many times you may feel as though life is going too fast in the city. A trip to Yeouido park is a great way to take a break from that world. You can relax and enjoy nature. This park is particularly beautiful in early spring and on a rainy day in November, (bring an umbrella on that day)."
Hire a bike and watch the world go by.,"A great place to relax, play sport, people watch, exercise or ride a hired bike around for a few hours :)"
Nice view especially at spring and autumn,This park is excellent for 30min or 1hour walk. The view is no nice especially at spring and autumn. There are many benches to relax and you can buy drinks and snacks at reasonable price.
"Spectacular, no matter the weather","I have spent time in Yeouido Park in Spring when my partner and I hired a tandem-bike to ride around the park and then in late Autumn when it was covered in snow. The park has some gorgeous spots to visit, be they playgrounds, little lakes or the outdoor fitness/gym area. Such a beautiful park in a huge city...as good as NYC's Central Park in my books."
Good park for a stroll,"Best Cherry blossom. Best fireworks. But check the schedule beforehand. It's got a little pond, plaza, statues and pretty gardens. They rent bicycles at reasonable rate. Continue to the public river park east of the Yeouido Park."
Great place for walk,It is possible to have a great walk there with special options. There is a special walk road with soft surface and beautiful places.
Large park in the centre of the city,"Make your way on the express line 5 and exit at Yeouido Park and take exit 2 or 3. Upon leaving the station walk down the wide boulevard and cross over Yeoui-daero road and you are in the park. To your left is a sports ground but beyond that is an ecological forest, Korean speak for a wooded area left untouched, a chance to see what the area may have look like before it became the first airport for the city. To your right is the more garden part of the park where you can find plenty of garden styles and the Korean forest garden, well worth the look. We visited in late summer, but the view in spring with flowering trees, and autumn with the trees changing colour must be a spectacular site. You can take the underpass at the end or cross the road to enter Yeouido Hanging park (Hanging is Korean for river) where you can see a large area designed for the locals to enjoy water and an open area. You may be surprised to see rows of tents there like some sort of boy scout camp. They are available for the locals to rent for the day when they visit the park and have somewhere to keep their belongings.  "
Come during the blossom season in Spring,"If you come during the correct 2 weeks of spring then this park is very beautiful, full of flowers and blossoms and green everywhere, very good opportunities for pictures. If you don't come in the correct time it is just an average park. You can rent a bicycle and there is a little outdoor gym and a stream, etc. I always liked parks in the middle of cities though."
Average,"Yeouido Park is very popular, especially in the spring. Many people would come to see flower festivals. If you love flower, visit here in the spring. But summer and winter have their own worth."
a park with a difference,excellent view during the cherry blossom season. the cherry blossoms are covered with snow and look so dazling.feels so good to have a morning walk. easily accessible by jihachul from any place around seoul.
Managed very well,I had been in this park 4 times during my stay to Seoul. Park is good and equipped with required facilities. 
Peaceful relaxing park,"This is a beautiful relaxing, peaceful park right on the Han River. Unless you are spending a lot of time in Seoul, I do not think you will want to take the time to visit here. I hope you will have the time because it is so refreshing and restful. Take the metro, line 5, purple line and get off at Yeouinaru station and the park will be right in front of you. The entire park takes a T shape, all along the river and the middle from the river inland. But the river section is ideal. Lots of native trees, plants and flowers, walking trials, skateboarders, bikers and benches for resting. Unfortunately this was not cherry blossom time, otherwise it would be even more beautiful. As I was just passing thru to building 63, next time I will enjoy and investigate more of this huge park, especially the Korean Forest with all native foliage, and culture square. If you have time and need a peaceful break from sightseeing and shopping, visit Yeouido Park. If it is summer and very sunny, a hat might be recommended."
It's lovely in winter time!,"It's been a long time since I was in Korea for the first time! I was there with my family and it's our first family trip abroad. We went there in winter and the weather was extremely cold!! However, this place was just lovely and cozy to talk a walk. The scenery was beautiful!! It's definitely a perfect spot to go with your boyfriend or girlfriend !! Haha "
I missed the cherry blossoms T_T,I was a week late and completely missed the cherry blossoms lol. Still a great park. I almost fell asleep here after lunch because I was so relaxed lol. If I saw the cherry blossoms I'm sure my rating for this place would be 5 out of 5.
Come to Yeouido Park during Cherry Blossom Festival (Every April)!,"We ensured that we timed our trip during the Cherry Blossom Festival in April.It was packed with revellers but it was soooo amazing! We didn't visit during the actual days of the Festival as we read that the crowds would be overwhelming. We visited 2 days BEFORE the actual start of the Festival. It is crowded but manageable. See pics I've posted. So my advice: Come 2 days BEFORE the actual festival if you don't like to be squeezed in by the crowds. Come at around 4pm and stay till 8pm. You get to photograph the huge park during the daylight and evening. At night, the whole area will be lighted up in colorful lights. Like a fairytale land!If you are hungry, there are plenty of food sold around this area. At the entrance to the park, there are lots of street vendors selling food. Or you can cross the road and head to one of the many cafes and restaurants! There is even a Bibigo chain across the road (for Korean fast food)."
"People watching, fresh air, and exercise...","This is an outdoor park with a walking trail along the Han river. On a nice day, or when there are events, it can get quite crowded. People come with a blanket and sit on the grass and enjoy food and soju. There are bicyclists, skate boarders, couples out for a walk, tourists waiting for a boat ride on the river - all of that makes for some interesting people watching and some fun observations. A walk along the path is good exercise and you'll get to see the locals relaxing and having fun. A boat ride on the river is a fun way to end the visit at dusk. Often the boat will have some comedy entertainment on the way back to the dock. But remember it's all just for fun."
Cherry Blossoms Galore,"Loved walking slowly under the cherry blossoms, both during the day and in the evenings, very nice attraction with lots of visitors for about a week each year."
A rest spot in the middle of the city,Yeouido is a lovely area. Despite being in the heart of the financial district it doesn't feel like the middle of the city. There are some lovely hotels and restaurants near by
Nice view of the city,It is a nice park with a great view of Seoul. We also did a cruise on the Han river. It didn't cover too much but it was a fun activity on our way to the 63 building.
A very nice park with attractive scenery,"It's not a huge park but it has all of the things that you need. It has a jogging trail, a lane where you can ride your bike, basketball courts, and nice flowers. You can also go during cherry blossom season and see even more pretty flowers. It's not too far from the IFC Mall or Han River so you can add that to your day of fun as well!"
just a normal park,Its a place to relax. The locals go there to spend time with their family. Jogging and dont forget the basket ball court. They have 8 basketball court so a lot of space for everyone.
Cherry Blossom and Biking trails,"Is a lot of fun to go to they have a lot of things to do for entertainment from biking and walking trail, to strolling thru the park laying in the grass under some trees reading books, to meeting up with friends from the nearby offices. It really is a nice little park. While I was there they were having the Cherry Blossom festival with live music. That was very enjoyable. "
A Beautiful Park Even after the Cherry Blossoms Season,"There are two parks with similar names - but this one, Yeouido Park isn't the one facing Hangang. I missed the cherry blossoms by a week or two unfortunately, but the park is still beautiful! Families were having picnics, cycling and going for a walk when I was there. The park is big and the different parts each has different themes. Besides the well kept and clean garden, there are basketball courts and huge area to play skateboards, cycling etc. A must-go indeed and go for a walk/cycling and what have you, just as how the Seoulites do :) Go for a long walk or rent a bike, this park is worth a visit! (you can reach the park from either Yeouido /Yeouinaru Stations)"
"Late April cherry blossoms, nice walk!","We went there on late april, so not much can see. but still can have a early morning walk, some late blossoms able to view.so far, it's a huge and nice park."
Cherry Blossoms,We were there just when the cherry blossoms were in bloom.This was our first time to see cherry blossoms.There were rows of cherry blossoms trees lined on both sides of the main street. There were lots of tourists & Korean citizens admiring the flowers and taking lots of pictures. Korea's cherry blossoms are a lighter shade of pink compared to Japan's darker pink cherry blossoms.
Cherry blossoms!,"Luckily, we were able to see cherry blossoms around this area duringbour visit to Seoul. It was quite a long stretch to walk to but it has a good view of the city on one side. We also saw some having wedding pictorials, picnics and a couple of cyclists. Besides the cherry blossoms, there were also several tulips placed along the road."
Pretty in pink,"Took a walk through the park and enjoyed the beautiful cherry blossom on a warm Sunday afternoon in April, it does get very busy but this does not detract from the sea of beautiful petals, and it is always a pleasure to see so many people enjoying themselves, then strolled along The Han River. Very enjoyable."
Spacious park for a good walk,"Our first stop for Cherry Blossom in Seoul, but, we found the road behind the National Assembly to be better. It was a long walk from Yeouido Park to National Assembly but well worth it."
Cherry blossom festival,"We were here for the cherry blossom festival and it was amazing! A beautiful walk, and area in general. We went through the park and our kids loved to play. "
I just love this park!,"We spent about an hour in this park since it has rows of cherry blossom. What I liked about this Park is that you can rent a bike and explore the whole length of the park with ease. It is also very clean and street food is available in case you get hungry, there is also a place to eat if you want to sit down and enjoy the view. There are benches where you can just sit and stare at the river and just do nothing. I was also attracted to the Tulips by the road side. I will definitely go back to this park in my next visit :)"
Go in March or early April,"The trees are blossoming and the chance for great photos are abundant. The trees surrounded the buildings and officials provided lots of portable rest rooms. Parking can be found but it is tight. Get there early, beat the crowds. If possible bring your own drinks and snacks. All in all if you like flowering trees and other floral displays you will not be disappointed."
Pretty maids all in a row...,We went to Yeouido Park during the cherry blossoms season and park was beautiful with trees lined on either side.Locals and tourists delighted in the festivities and there were street performers who mad the entire experience an enjoyable one...
Family fun in 2 wheels..,"We rented bicycles for 2 hours and had fun and wonderful time riding in the park and going furthrr beyond. This park is located within business area as can see alot of office buildings. This is a wonderful way to explore this part of the city and further , the long cycling routes bring you through bridges, sea, parks.But watch your time as you need to have ample time to return back the bicycle at the booth."
Oasis amidst Buildings,"Went there this morning on a Sunday. Today April 5, the full bloom of the cherry blossoms has been delayed by mother nature probably due to climate change. Still, those along the road surrounding the National Assembly had a few hundred already in semi-bloom so still was worth the trip. I could just imagine when it is in full bloom a few weeks from now. Wish I was still here in Korea to see it. I don't get to see these where i come from. The park itself is a very relaxing place and the best part for me is i got to smell the scent of pine trees again! Last time i got to breath in these scent was literally decades ago! What a beautiful smell it was this morning! Totally refreshing! If you have the time to spare after you get tired of shopping and going to various tourist sites in Korea, i would suggest a visit here. Very easy to get to. Just as it is described by my fellow trip advisors. It is definitely an oasis in a city!"
Must-go for couple cycling and strolling!,"We didn't have any expectation when visiting this park, but I was quite amazed at how everything is well maintained at this park. And even more so that they have bike rental for couples!!! It's something very relaxing and enjoyable to do during a trip, that is different from the usual city rush shopping and eating. So, this was definitely fun and relaxing for me, plus we got to see some sakura, which was an added bonus!"
Beautiful,"This is a gorgeous park, surrounded by tall buildings in a modern part of town. There is that much to do besides walking and taking in the views but it provides for nice panoramas over the river."
Couple's must-go!,"This park enlighten my day during my visit to Seoul. It was during autumn season, thus the weather is perfectly good. We rent the bicycle for 2 hours and I still think that was not enough time! The park is large and the environment is clean and tidy which I have never been to before. Most importantly, it is just laying beside Hangang River, you can enjoy the view of the beautiful city. Best time to go there is 4pm-7pm. Opssss,I miss it so much now!"
Great place for cycling,I went cycling here with a friend. Lovely view along the Han river. A great place to be when you get fed up with the busy city.
One of the best places to visit for cherry blossoms,"This place is good to visit during cherry blossom season, although it can get packed, so don't go if you hate crowds. It's a good area next to the Han river, you can ride bikes here and eat at some of the restaurants nearby, however there aren't many. It's better to pack a picnic or go to one of the several convenience stores in the area. A great place to hang out with friends and once of a few top places in Seoul with grass to picnic on and hang out. "
relaxing place in the city,"This park is very large with various activities that one can never tired of. On a lazy night I've tried river cruising along Han River, passing the colourful bridges and wonderful night view of Seoul. On another day, I've tried cycling on its rented bicycle at KRW3,000 per person per hour. There were many lively activities anywhere you go. At a corner, there was a busker performing his magic including playing with fire. On another, a live concert was going on, viewed by hand-in-hand couples. And on a quiet part at the river bank, a guy was trying his luck on catching a fish.This is the place to go for relaxing, for all kinds of age, away from the noise of the traffic but not too far away from the city centre. There is just something interesting to everyone."
Relaxing ,"If you like spending time just relaxing and hanging around in parks this is for you. You can go walk in the water fountain which was just fantastic. Lots of public restrooms as well, but bring your own snacks as there are no stores or anything nearby."
Yeouido Cherry Blossom Festival in Spring,"Yeouido Park is a large recreational area, a long rectangular park, located in the central part of Seoul. The park is divided into four themes mainly the Traditional Korean Forest, Grass Square, Culture Square, and Nature’s Ecosystem Forest. My main highlight to this park is for the cherry blossom trees, which are mostly 30 to 40 years old, all planted along in a stretch of about 6km long path.There is a few ways to go Yeouido Park1. Yeouinaru Station (nearer to Yeouido Hangang Park), exit 1, walk towards SBS TV Station.2. Yeouido Station, exit 3, walk towards the National Assembly Building.3. National Assembly Station, exit 6, walk along the path with trees.On the other side of Yeouido Park and is the Yeouido Hangang Park, basically this part of the park is located along the Hangang River which explains the name.For more details of my Korea trip do visit: http://nkikichua.blogspot.sg/2014/08/wanderlust-seoul-korea-day-5-yeouido.html"
Nothing special,"Yeouido park is located in the center of the city and it is one of the few parks in SeoulIt's a quite sad place in my opinion. But korean people like it, especially in the springtime when this park can be VERY crowded of people making photo at those sad cherry blossom trees"
Great walk,"I stayed in hotel near buy. I walked in the park twice a day in the morning and in the evening. You can have great walk there. Do not use just peripheral ring... get inside, it is nice there. Park is well designed. The main walkway surface is from hard foam material. It is great for run. There are several restroom and small convenient shops. Avoid lunch hours as Park becomes totally packed by employees from nearby offices."
Cherry blossom in spring,Arguably one of the best spot in Seoul during spring for cherry blossom. Absolutely gorgeous and not to mention that its really close to IFC mall.
Nice but not more than that,A great spot to relax or eat a take away or a packed picknic if you are in the area. Certainly not worth and effort comming especialy to see it. 
A great park to go to!,"This park is set in the midst of city and government buildings just south of the river. This park, not to be confused with Yeouido Hangang Park, also offers quite a few activities. You can go biking and rollerblading around the park as well to make it more fun. In the spring, it is even more gorgeous with cherry blossoms and other flowers making the park more colorful and alive. There are exercise machines you can try and spaces to have a little picnic at. The last time I went with a friend to just walk around to really enjoy nature in all its spring awesomeness. Another time, my friends and I went cycling and I gotta say, that was one of the best times we had in Seoul just going through the park on a lovely sunny day. We got a bit of sweat on us but all worth it."
when nature meets park,"We kinda missed out the cherry blossom season by the time we're at Seoul but its alright. We still wana glimpse on how Yeouido Park looks like. Its quite a big park i would say with lovely ponds and traditional resting stops for you to rest and relax by the pond. You'll see alot of people cycling or playing basketball there. Its like a peaceful, relaxing getaway from the hectic city life since its all surrounded by nature.And guess what! haha we actually spotted a white rabbit hopping about at the park as we cycle. It was an eye opening moment. A rabbit running wild in the park?? Daebak! well im not sure if it belongs to any owner but it's just hopping freely there haha. A different country does has different happenings around."
Wonderful park...something every major city should replicate,"Yeouido city is in the middle of the business district with a huge mall nearby and many restaurants and shops surrounding it. If you are staying in the area, it is great to walk through, look at the beautiful spring flowers or take a run (the track is foam so much better on your knees than the road). It is such a well done park and it is nice to have such peace and beauty right next to one of the busiest and widest roads I have ever seen."
The blossom jackpot,"Predicting cherry blossoms is a tricky business and Yeouido Spring Flower Festival is probably the sole reason for a tourist to be at the park. It is popular among locals for picnics and cycling but nothing beats the elusive flowers. It is the only time the roads around the National Assembly area is closed to traffic and in its absence, performance stages and vendors line the entire stretch, with the occasional splattering of photo opportunities with roaming mascots (we bumped into Hello Kitty). The festival extends into the weekdays but you'll miss a lot of the action (not the crowd tho; it's pretty packed through the entire blossom season).Mobile toilets are available It's accessible by train (20-25 mins away from Seoul station) and if you are planning to leave by taxi, avoid the usual peak hours."
awesome place to spot spring blooms!,I missed Seoul Spring Festival by a week but I still had fun spotting cherry blossoms and other spring flowers in bloom from the National Assembly building to Yeouido Park.Yeouido Park has a very good therapeutic walkway and a bike lane.
Different side of Seoul,We went here hoping we would see cherry blossoms. We were too late. It was interesting to see how Seoul looks like south of the Han River. There are huge modern buildings. We had a nice walk along the park. The flowers were in bloom. Toddlers were brought by their teachers to the park to run around. 
Visit during the Spring Flower Festival!,"The huge recreational park is divided into sections with themes - a traditional Korean area with trees and gardens, grassy hill, cultural square and a 'nature's ecosystem' forest. Some call it the 'Central Park (New York)' or 'Hyde Park (Sydney)' of Seoul. Many locals rent bikes to ride around or just play games like Basketball. During Spring, the area livens up with the beautiful Cherry Blossoms."
Harmony,"If you love peace, go to this park. And if you love Cherry Blossoms or want to see one. You SHOULD go to this park. The park is extremely beautiful along with the blossoming cherry blossoms. :)))"
Spendid cherry blossoms at night!,Cherry blossoms in Yeouido park is gorgeous during the day but particularly spendid at night when different lightings lit up the cherry trees. There were concerts and street performers both day and night.
Stunning! When the Cherry Blossoms are in Bloom...,"This park is absolutely gorgeous, particularly during the short period of time when the cherry trees are in full bloom. Situated along the coast of Yeouido Island, the park offers spectacular views of the waterfront, as well as ample room for picnicking! Stalls line the road, adjacent to the cherry trees, which are the real attraction here. I suggest visiting during the Spring Flower Festival."
Cheery blossom,We came here during cherry blossom. Wow! The whole park was covered by cheery trees... It was beautiful on the sunny morning. 
Barebones park,"Give it a few decades, more thoughtful green coverage and less concrete and this could be a decent public space but at the moment it is too open and bare. The cherry blossoms are a welcome sight for sore eyes but there are too few trees overall so there's always crowds around the few trees available."
Cherry blossom 2014,Lovely view of the cherry blossom in full bloom. Awesome view of National Assembly and the Han river. Festival starts tomorrow.
Great Bike Park,"Biking in this park is the best, there is a designated bike path and it is a great path. There are basketball courts in the middle and people just exercising and playing sports in the area. The trees and scenery is pretty good and Han River is right next to the entrance."
Cherry Blossoms Overrated,"If your main purpose is to see the cherry blossoms, don't go. They look good in pictures and TV but in reality it is very dissappointing. Positive note, it is a nice park to go biking and walking distance to IFC mall."
My favoriite ...,"Yeouido Park was my favorite place during my stay in Seoul.The Han river view is amazing and there are many activities to do there.Simply, It is a nice place to enjoy the fresh air and refresh your mind ;) "
Yeouido: beautiful in April,"I went there in the springtime; I believe it was in April. Yeouido Park is lined up with cherry blossom trees for anyone to enjoy whether kids, teens, or adults. It is hard to explain the beauty of it. It must be seen to be believed, especially in April when cherry blossom trees bloom in Seoul."
Loved autumn biking here!,"I came here a few weeks ago when the autumn leaves were in full play. I LOVE it. The placed looked so beautiful. We rented biked for 4 hours costing 9,000, and boy was it worth it. In four hours we managed to see most of not just the park, but Yeoiudo as a whole. Really recommend renting bikes an exploring. Ride along the Han River with the rest of the cyclists - lots of silver grass next to the river makes for some beautiful sights. I really hope everyone can see this place during autumn. I never got the chance during the cherry blossom season, but I can imagine it may be as beautiful. There's lots of places to rent bikes, and also roller blades, scooters to."
bicycling along the han river with my friends,"one of my best memories in seoul was simply rent a bicycle in the park and just bicycle along the han river, it was during peak summer so the sky was bright blue after days of rain, and the wind blowing from the river made me forget the heat. we cycled passing the public pool and the national assembly, and many other landmarks that we recognised from Running Man :p . a nice and relaxing change of pace from the sometimes crowded areas of myeongdong and namdaemun. i highly recommend to those going to seoul for the first time."
Beautiful cherry blossom sight!,"During April 2013, I visited Yeouido Park and it's the time of the year where the cold winter air is starting to fade and flowers are starting to bloom. Every April, Cherry Blossom Festival is held at Yeouido Park, (여의도 공원). It had been a lifelong wish to see cherry blossom, thankful to witness one of the prettiest face of Mother Nature!The annual Yeouido Spring Flower Festival 2013 celebrates the full blossoms of spring in the backdrop of Han River at Yeouido Park. To Get There by Subway, Line 9 National Assembly Stn. Exit 6, walk 5 minutes OR Line 5 Yeouinaru Stn. Exit 1, walk 15 minutes. As one of the most popular parks along Hangang River, it attracts many visitors. You can read more on my write up at, http://jacqsowhat.blogspot.sg/2013/08/seoul-korea-day-5-yeouido-hangang-park.htmlThank you! http://jacqsowhat.blogspot.sg/2013/08/seoul-korea-day-5-yeouido-hangang-park.html"
Beautiful Park in Seoul,"It is beautifl park in Seoul. You can easily walk Saetgang Brridge near Singil Station.There are many place for visitors such as KBS, Shopping Mall, Sports Courts, Korean Style Lake , etc."
Nice full cherry blossom!,"I just visited Yeouido Park (behind National Assembly Building) on 19 April (Friday) & all the trees were in full bloom! I read that last year the cherry blossoms also peaked on 19 April. My family & I were so ecstatic as the view is magnificent! Very romantic, but it is very nice for family outing too. I know that cherry blossoms don't last long so I think we were really lucky. Not only in this park, but the cherry trees in other part of Seoul were in full bloom too! This was my first time seeing so many cherry trees in full bloom, so yes this is such a precious & sweet experience. There were some stalls selling all kind of snacks on the street too. Come on weekdays, as weekends will be too crowded.But we missed the Cherry Blossom Festival by 1 day, which lasted from 12-18 April 2013. During this festival, you can expect to see many street or cultural performances, and flower exhibitions."
Yeouido!,"Yeouido Park is one of the sooo many parks Seoul have. It has always been famous for its cherry blossoms on Spring seasons. But having visited Seoul on a winter for the first time, I've only seen it all white. It's a really huge park located in the middle and elegantly surrounded by buildings of all sorts. Being a ""business person"" myself who lives in the middle of the business district in my home country, I came to appreciate this park as it sits right where it is. Knowing from dramas how beautiful Seoul is, I was still captivated by it when I've set foot there myself.Yeouido Park. A must visit. Definitely going back there on my Spring vacation so i get to right those bicycles. (we wanted to, but we'll freeze to death, so didn't even try anymore..haha)Love it!"
A glimpse of paradise on earth?,"Visiting Yeouido Park was the highlight of our holiday in Seoul. The cherry blossoms were the reason why we came in April during spring time. We have heard that it’s not easy to predict when the cherries will bloom. But on this day, the 19th of April 2013, we came, and saw with our own eyes what we had only previously seen in pictures. We were told that the cherries started blooming 5 days before we came. To see the cherries still blooming when we were there, was a lucky day for us. Indeed, we actually saw the black and white magpies a few times at Yeouido, which are known in Korea as the bird that brings good luck. We started our tour of Yeouido Park from Yeouinaru Station at 9 am. It was cool and sunny, and a great day for a stroll. We admired the pink canopy of sakuras all the way to the National Assembly. There are many sakura trees in Seoul, but here in Yeouido Park, there must have been a thousand. We felt like we could walk forever, strolling tirelessly with the Han River flanking on one side and the commercial Seoul skyline on the other. Words just cannot describe how wonderful and serene we felt. We love the weather, the trees, the crowd, the couples, the school children, the performers and the stall vendors. It was marvelous when an unknown group of locals wanted to immersed themselves with us in a group photo. If there is paradise on earth, we may have got a glimpse of it right here in Yeouido Park."
Cherry Blossoms Galore,"Luckily for me , the Yeuido Hanggang Park Spring festival was extended for another week ! I saw the Cherry Blossoms in full bloom , and the one can never get tired of walking under the lovely white snow-like canopy of blossoms ! Truly , a memorable park walk in my life , It may have been too cold for spring, but the sight of the blooms will warm you up ;) "
Family fun,"The sun came out and the park is huge but had a lot of families, you can rent bikes,roller skates and stay all day, they have walking spongy walkways so great on your feet. Also stationary equipment that Korean people use daily for exercise.also lots of wee places to eat, very nice it's by their financial district. The Marriott is walking distance to the district. A calm clean nice place,, "
Relax and comfortable,"A large park in the city and it is sit between the Yeouido and National Assembly station. I went there in April, the cherry blossoms almost in full bloom, such a beautiful place and good for photo shooting."
"Popular place to see blossoms, but over crowded","Blossoms in Korea are a rite of passage: you simply must go out and see their collective beauty. Seoulites love to go to Yeouido to witness the blossoms in full bloom, and it is lovely, but there are a host of other much better, lest crowded spots to see. I prefer the sites of Seoul National University (there is a trail leaving from the main gate where people hike up to see a tree lined street leading up to a temple), and there are many other much more lovely spots all over the Korean peninsula, as virtually every part of the country has cherry blossoms. There are some very famous spots, that a quick google search will help you find, but if you go to virtually any town you will find a lovely hike with blossom trees."
All year round nice place to hang,"Except for winter its a all year round great place to picnic with friends, take a stroll, rent a bike and wizz around, have some beer and eat some goodies. Cherry blossoms bloom down the whole street during Spring and in October theres the annual Fireworks show. Lots of great memories. "
Fireworks!,"Well I went here in September when there was an International Fireworks Festival and it was crowded! Ofc it was crowded, but we still managed to find a good spot to watch the fireworks. But at day light it's great to walk through it. :)"
The best places in autumn!,There's a few place to see leaves change color and fall off the trees. You can rent the bicycle for a leisurely ride along the beautiful Han River next to the park either.When I was there the autumn had just started before I leaved Korea.I was so lucky! ^^
Cherry Festival,Very crowded by the views of the Cherry Blossoms made up for it. Nice way to spend an afternoon. There were several vendors to purchase food and drink along the way.
Just another part of the Han river park.,"It's really only nice during the spring cherry blossom festival, but then there are so many people it's not worth going. Really just go to the Han River park if you want a nice park."
Oasis of peace,"Quite a few big cities have parks where people can relax and rest and de-stress. Central Park in New York comes to mind, as does the wonderful Kirstenbosch Gardens in Cape Town, but in Seoul there is a strip of garden that is also a wonderful tribute to nature as well as a peaceful spot in which to look at some of the history of Korea. I'm talking about Yeouido Park. Located on Yeouido Island, in the middle of the Han River, and with the towering office blocks all around, this strip of vegetation will take you about an hour or two to stroll through. You can reach it via the subway line 5, Yeouido Station, and exiting from the station it's a short walk down to the park. There is a bike path as well as a pedestrian/jogger walkway, made of lovely springy rubber so it's really easy to walk or run in comfort. There's a pond with little viewing areas, where you're actually above the water surface so that you can, if you want to, drop some crumbs of your lunch for the fish lurking in the depths to vacuum up.The statue of King Sejong, so far only seen in photos, was much larger than I thought, and very imposing and serene. It really conveys the sense of reverence that Koreans, rightly so, hold this ruler in.The grass is untrimmed, giving a spring meadow feel, yet it's also lovely and neat. There are park benches every few paces where you can sit, rest, meditate and recuperate. There is even a small forest.Added to all this is a lovely big open plaza where special events and exhibitions can be held.All in all, if you like parks, and like either skating, biking, running or just strolling in them, I can recommend this place."
Beautiful “Cherry Blossoms”,"Was here on 17 April during Spring....and was lucky enough to catch the beautiful spring flower ""Cherry Blossoms"" ! We spent about 2hrs here to enjoy the beautiful park !"
Go when the cherry blossoms are out,"I went here twice, the second time I was lucky enough to catch the blossoms out. It's just beautiful! I took my inline skates with me and skated around the bike path, it was fantastic.Probably the best place to skate in Seoul, I even found a big area where I could do some jumps and artistic skating."
Frankly Speaking.,"I have experience about visit Yeouido But, doesn't have that of Yeouido park. Sakura will be beautiful."
Beautiful with the Cherry Blossoms!,"We specially visited Yeouido Park during the Spring Festival (13 to 17 April) when the cherry blossoms are in bloom. It was a Sunday and there were many activities offered: bouncy castle, caricature painting etc. There were also food and drinks offered in the stalls. Quite a local affair and it was lovely rubbing shoulders with the locals. There is a line of cherry blossom trees behind the National Assembly building. Not all the cherry blossoms were in full bloom, I would say about two-thirds. I think we are a few days too early. Still it was picture perfect and a great atmosphere!"
Nice place to enjoy the outdoors,"When I visited the park if was raining, but it was still beautiful. The view on the National Assembly building from the far on one side, the view on the high-rise buildings on the other side, and in the park, you will find more than enough possibilities to enjoy the outdoors...Also, there are a lot of events taking place in the park so you might catch a good show, a sporting event, etc"
Spot some idols???,"peoples always come here to get chances to spot some idols (who might be come here from KBS just for fun, or practising on the stage in the middle of the park) while enjoy the scenery and fresh air. Located opposite to KBS, and hangang river... its a nice place to hangs out with friends and family. "
Spring Beauty,Yeouido park is the place to be when the Cherry Blossoms start to bloom!! 
A nice place to bike and spend time with family,"Yeouido Park used to be a military heliport but the Korean government turned it into a giant park for both the people and the workers whose offices are around there. Yeouido is a financial district of Seoul but Yeouido Park is a great place to go biking, spend time with your family, and just chill. It's easy to get there from Yeouido subway station on the No. 5 line. You can also rent bikes there."
Rent a tandem bike,We had an extra afternoon in Seoul so we went to this park by the river and rented a tandem bike. It was soooo much fun. It is pretty busy but it makes for fun pictures and great memories
