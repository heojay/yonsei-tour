Well-maintained and less crowded,"Dried seafoods are majorities. And this is not well-known to tourists. So, mostly not crowded.But, it also has various street foods and other products.Good place for tourists, too."
Big Dried Fisheries Market in Seoul.,"C ( 19.05.08 )This market was the most big in Seoul dealing in Dried Fisheries Market. The market was renovated to modern shape, so had clean atmosphere. If want to buy Dried Fisheries Market in Seoul, there was very good market. One of Korea traditional big market."
Dried seafood market,Found this place by change en route to N Seoul Tower.Really interesting. Lots and lots of dried seafood product and we saw some delicious kimci also. Must be yummy.Since we cook most of our meals we made a note to come here first and stock up should we come back to Seoul soon.
Dried Fish Market,"Crazy, two streets under a big roof selling dried food, mostly fish! We bought 800 g of dried fish which they vaccumed sealed for us, price: KRW 8.000 - increadible price if you love squid.Let the pics speak..."
"Caution about the ""Air""","I had worked in the area for over 12 years and had walked by the market on Euljiro many, many times. Back for a visit i decided to walk thru the market, it was interesting...but I had to find my way out after about 10-15 minutes. The dried fish creates dust with a strong odor. It played havoc with my nose, and after leaving the odor stayed with me for hours. Sadly, I will never go back. It is an interesting place for sure but if you have a sensitive nose, be cautious. There are other wonderful markets in Seoul to visit, Namdaemun, Insadong, and Noryongjin Fish market for example."
Local dry market,There are many stalls selling dry food. A lot of locals shop at this market as well. Most of the sellers cant speak English. So there will be a lot of pointing and translating (if you have internet).Worth visiting to see how its like to visit a local market. 
sauced crabs,See lots of interest things there. the sauced raw crabs are very famous there. tried one and tasty. Would you like to try?? :)
Nice market,Small and nice market to go around and look at. Not so much shopping to do. People are nice and friendly. We lived close by so wasn't a detour to visit. 
Chungbu or Jongbu.. whatever its good visual.. esp dried fish,"Always visit the local markets to get a sense what people eat and local colours and smells.A stone's throw from chungmoro and/or other stations, we stumbled upon this market during our walkabout from our stay in Chungmoro Residence.I found the sights, sounds and smells exotic. All sort of kimchi and dried fish, shrimps and chilli paste. The premises are fairly clean and dry unlike many markets in Asia (they call wet market).Look out for the dried fish all strung up in neat rows... never seen fish (dried) sold like these. You might find a fruit seller somewhere and other stuff in the market. Worth a visit if only you are staying in the Chungmoro or Hyundai residence or other hotels nearby. Not worth the trip if you are outside the immediate zone as they are bound to be markets like these all over Seoul"
I loved Jungbu Market,"I really loved Jungbu Market. I just love traditional market.The market is very clean, with no fishy smells. Friendly Ajumma sells varieties dried fish, squids, seaweed, gingseng etc. The market definitely a fun place to look around.I just loved visiting traditional market."
Tons of different type of dried fish,I've never seen so many different types of dried fish. Even if you're not buying anything it's still a sight to see. Its a great place to visit. 
Never mind the shopping what an awesome cultural experience!,"In my opinion you can't beat a local market when travelling abroad for a true cultural experience and ""Chungbu Market"" (some say Jungbu) doesn't disappoint. There are hundreds of market stalls selling all sorts of produce, but I find the 'fish' produce the most interesting, even though you have to cope with the fishy smells that go with it.Some great photo opportunities and the market traders seemed very friendly. I went early on a Saturday morning (8:30am) and it was perfect as the stalls were all freshly laid out and heaped with interesting things to see and photograph. Just a 2 minute walk from Exit 6 or 7 of Euljiro4-ga Subway Station on Green Line 2. Well worth a visit, as long as you like dried fish!"
