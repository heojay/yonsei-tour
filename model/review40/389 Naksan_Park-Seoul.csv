You can walk this park with a free guide,"For a young country like South Korea, this park has changed a lot. The best way to learn about the history and changes in the park and the wall surrounding the park book a free walking tour. This one is called ""Seoul fortress"" and takes about 2 hours. You will learn about Korean history, the 4 main gates, visit the wall museum and walk up to the top of the park to get a good view of Seoul. It takes 2 to 3 hours because you have to get to the Dongdaemun Station to meet the guide."
Quiet city park,"From Hyehwa Station, I first visited the nearby Marronnier Park before arriving at Naksan park and then continue my way to Ihwa mural village. Reaching the park requires a moderate hike uphill for about 450 meters. It was hot & sunny as I was there around noon. There were only a few locals using the park.The park features multiple facilities an exhibition hall, a pavilion, a center for seniors, basketball courts, badminton courts, and many squares that offer wonderful views of the area below. A portion of the old fortress wall runs through the park. From Naksan Park, visitors can walk along the Seoul City Wall to Dongdaemun."
Very nice,It's a nice park with great views on the city. It's very steep. It's next to Ihwa Maeul so it is easy to combine the two.
less crowded place to enjoy sakura,"Close to mural village and good leisurely place to hike. The view at the top is amazing and can see Seoul N tower from far away. The sakura there was unbelievable and relatively less crowded, so you can actually have a picnic and enjoy the view from the top. Can also hike from Naksan park down along the way to DongDaeMun in around an hour if taking your time to take in everything. Would definitely recommend, even those with children."
Naksan Park walk,"beautiful view in the cherry blossom season, fresh air for comfortable walk up the hill .Another suggested season to visit would be October to November. A refresh spot located in the city Centre. One of the four mountains in Seoul city."
Quiet and beautiful,"Although not many, I think the cherry blossom here completes the park and makes it a beautiful place to walk and spend time with love ones.Do visit the mural village which is just a 10 mins walk away, worth the visit :)"
"Best Seoul,s view with less visitor","Most of foreign tourist is really familiar with Namsan Park with its cable car and beautiful Seoul's view from the mountain. But, for domestic, there is one similar spot near Dongdaemun, it called Naksan Park. There is China's Great Wall miniatur and you can stroll along this wall to get the peak. The other way, after arriving at dongmyo station exit 10, you can take local green bus no.3 to Naksan Park directly, more efficient for family trip... :)"
Seoul Secret/Hallyu couple place - Naksan Park,"Naksan Park - In Korean ‘nakta’ means camel and ‘san’ means mountain and therefore its camel hump-like appearance. Reaching the park requires a moderate hike uphill from Hyehwa Station in Daehangno for about 450 meters. Located in the center of the Seoul, this historical and beautiful park has panoramic views of the entire city. A portion of the old Seoul Fortress Wall runs (Seoul Seonggwak) built during the Joseon Dynasty for protection against invaders and enemies runs through the park. The serene ambience is a perfect gateway from the city bustle. Its scenic beauty makes it a popular filming location for many Hallyu dramas. Take in the sunset views or stay till evening for twinkling lights of Seoul at Naksan Park. If you head to the eastern side (as you look at the mountain) follow the wall downwards to reach the top of Ihwa Mural Village. Alternatively, hike the downhill stretch to Dongdaemun Gate. If you're deadbeat after the walk, just take bus no. 3 at the top of the park to get off at Dongdaemun station. Directions: Take Subway Line 4 to Hyehwa (Exit 2). Walk 70 meters and make the first left where there is the sculpture for Marronnier Park. Continue on Daehak-ro 8ga-gil for 180 meters until it dead ends and make a right. Continue for 50 meters and make at the second left on to Guldari-gil. Continue uphill for 200 meters to reach the park on the left."
You've probably seen this place in K-Drama,"Famous place from all the K-Drama. We visited it while walking in the Ihwa Mural Village. We didn't pick the Naksan Park path, instead we climb the Ihwa Mural Village until we find the famous wall where all the K-Drama happening. It's nice and we'll probably hike the Naksan Park if it's not raining"
Pleasant Walk. Awesome View.,"We were there mid September and the temperature was around 25°C but the wind was cooling. We started our walk from the Seoul City Wall Museum, which is minutes walk from Dongdaemun Station, Exit 9. From there, we walked along a section of the remaining city walls. There are steps along the walls, though some parts have uneven steps. After about 20 minutes into the walk, we reached Ihwa Mural Village where we 'pit stop' to walk around the village to enjoy the numerous murals and arts scattered in the village.From there we continued our walk towards Naksan Park. It was a pleasant walk and from the crowd mix, it can be seen that this park is one of the favourites among locals to enjoy the sunset. We reached the peak just in time for sunset and stayed until the sun has set, when the lights on buildings began to light up this beautiful city.We descended the hill by walking along the city walls and reached our starting point, near Dongdaemun Station, Exit 9.Overall, it was a nice and pleasant walk. Would recommend visiting the park for the sunset at the peak."
Worth the Hike!,"Me and my friends came here in the afternoon, on a lovely sunny day. It was a good activity after 3 days of raining.. all the frustration from the previous rainy days was gone after arriving at the top. You will see beautiful view of city of Seoul from up the hill from 3 observation points... along with ample beautiful photo shoot opportunities. Definitely stress relieving .However, to get up here you have to do a bit of a hike. To me, the hike is not long, just a short 15 minutes hike but the paths were very steep at some points. Oh yes, before arriving at the entrance of this park, you have to hike up through the villages first , and here is very steep roads. So overall total time to reach the peak , for a non-fit potato like myself took around 45 minutes with lots of stops for photos. Wear suitable clothing as you will get sweaty, suitable shoes also for your dear feet's comfort."
Hilly city park,"Now this isn't a place I would seek out but we discovered it on our hiked uphill along the City Wall walking from Dongdaemun, the park is situated high on a ridge overlooking several Seoul neighbourhoods, so it was a great place for views. The park is spread down the hill, within the hilly park there were seats, a small pavilion with wooden platform for sitting and at the very bottom of the park a good collection of outdoor exercise equipment if this is your thing. Leaving the park we took the long set of wooden stairs down into the neighbourhood of Daehangno. I would suggest hiking in this direction as the opposite direction walking towards Dongdaemun I would think would be more challenging."
Awesome photo opportunity,Went in the evening and there were many locals there taking photos as well. It was a long climb from Hyehwa station but the view was awesome.
An arduous climb!,"This park is relatively easy to find, as it is very near HyeHwa station. The park is quite quiet, and there is a tiring climb to the 3 observations points. The summit has a very nice view of the city."
Great hike with great views,This is part of the old city wall in Seoul. The walk up to the wall at the top of the hill is very steep but worth the effort. From there you can walk downhill along the wall to Dongdaemun gate
Amazing park surrounded by city walls,"City walls in Joseon Dynasty still remain partially in Seoul. And this park is locating inside the remaining walls.- Locating on a hill, seniors may have difficulties. But, it's worthy of visiting with a great cityscape of Seoul and walls.- Accessible from Daehakro(Hyehwa Station) and Dongdaemun CIty Wall Park (Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station).- There's Ihwa Mural Village nearby and it's good to visit together."
not bad,"Not bad for a half day trip. Nice view of the city on top of the hill. The old city wall is quite well maintained but quite tiring to walk uphill. Some stairs are too steep. I came in mid April and saw some cherry blossoms. Way beyond its peak but still nice to walk around. Near the entrance of the park, there is a mural village and a shopping street full of cafes and restaurants."
An underrated place!!,"The Naksan park is a beautiful park and is definitely an underrated place. How to reach here: hyewha station, line no 4, exit 2/3.Walk for 450 m and the park is right there. It’s ok uphill so be ready to walk a lot. Not suitable for elderly. The place give a bird eye view of daehango and surrounding area. I recommend to start from the one end of park that is close to hyewha and then walk down to dongdaemun crossing the beautiful Iwha mural village on the way which has unique paintings on the wall of houses.Better to wear sport shoes and come. Nice view. Photogenic place. Can spend around 2-3 hours and reach dongdaemun via mural village. A must visit for someone who is spending adequate time in Seoul and can be skipped if spending only a limited days in Seoul."
Amazing View at Night!,"Had a nice walk here with my friend, stroll around and enjoy the night view. There are only few people going here."
Great view of Seoul,"This was a good place to hike. It was very hot however and lots of uphill climb to get to the top. We however did this during mid-day, so the sun was strong. It is located right in the Seoul old city wall, so that was neat. But be prepared for a steep climb. At the top, there were some pavilions to rest in, which was nice considering the climb. There is an easier, longer walk I believe to the top, but we did the stairs. It is also located close to the mural village. Would recommend, but probably better to do later in day for night view or early in morning before sun is at strongest."
Amazing few of Seoul for free,"Great place to view the city, however it requires to climb a bit of a moutain to get there. Also Hyehwa district is full of cool places for eating out."
One the best city view!,City walls make here's scenery perfect. Especially for sun set in a open day you can see the perfect combination of Seoul's city-nature combined face!
Me and my boyfriend trip,I went there in winter. I think it's a bit cold but if you go to top of the park between park and Ihwa mural you will see the beatiful city views. And you will see the cute village called Ihwamurall.
Enjoyable Walk,"The art murals are so-so and many are abit dated. However, it is still a place worth visiting as you get to see some of the cultural arts and the great views @ the submit. There are shops renting uniform cosplay and many local students renting them for photo shoots."
Walk,Is a long walk with a great view of the city. Close to the Mural Village. Lots of restaurants/coffee shops around and some art galleries close as well
Walk and Hike,We happened to find Naksan Park while walking around the mural village. It was peaceful and quiet so we were able to stroll around the park and enjoy the view. There's not much to do unless you want to hike up and go further. I wouldn't recommend going on a chilly day as it gets really cold towards end of the day. I'm sure the view is much nicer during spring and fall.
Long Walk,"Rather than a hiking feel, it has more of an incline long walk kinda feel. Weather was chilly when I had my walk from Dondaemun all the way up to Naksan Park. Beautiful scenery. One can slowly take their time to roam around the area and enjoy the landscape."
Pleasant autumn walk along Naksan fortress wall,"We are a family of 4 with 2 kids (age 7 & 9), on a 7 day 6 night DIY tour in Seoul. We signed up for the Seoul Fortress Wall Footpath - Naksan Course guided tour offered by the Korean Tourism Organisation. I booked the tour online about 2-3 weeks before the trip.It was a very enjoyable tour that started at Heunginjimun (兴仁门), and after that we walked leisurely up the Naksan mountain. We first stopped by the Seoul City Wall Museum where we got an overview of the developments of the fortress wall, including the penalties dished out to labourers who attempted to escape from the construction of the wall. The exhibits were very informative and engaging, even for the children. After the leaving the museum, we continued to trek on the inside of the fortress wall, and soon we walked pass the Ihwa Mural Village. We managed to capture some ""hip"" murals as we passed through the village, but the itinerary didn't cater to an in-depth exploration of the area. We soon reached the top of the Naksan mountain and then proceeded to descend along the outer wall. Although we are passed the peak of the autumn foliage, what remained still looked pretty impressive against the clear blue sky. Throughout the walk, our knowledgeable guide, Mr Lee Boo Yong, gave us a lot of information about the fortress wall and what we saw in the surroundings.The tour ended 11/2 hours later at the Hyehwa train station. A big thank you to Mr Lee for the tour! I would highly recommend it!"
Hike in the middle of Seoul ,"If you're looking for a moderate hike along a part of the old wall of the city, then I highly recommend this. The views are pretty amazing. You can see the mountains, skyline, including the N Seoul Tower. We didn't hike the entire section. If you're taking the metro here, get off at the Dongdaemun station and take exit 10. Cross the street and start your hike. Walk along the wall until you get to the main park on your left. From there, you can gradually walk down the path and stairs. You'll find a convenience store and bathrooms. Make your way down and you'll find yourself in an artsy neighborhood of galleries, restaurants and cafes. Once you get yourself to Daehak-ro, you'll see the Line 4 Hyehwa station. "
Seoul city wall,"In the attempt to trace the old city wall, part of it is up in Naksan. Take metro to Hyehwa station, there is some walk from the station, find the Lock Museum, there is a street nearby leading you uphill, quite steep I must say, but the view up on the mountain is rewarding."
Excellent place for walking ,"I like it so much. I spent my evenings at that place, looked city view and felt sunset. Also very good for walking exercise."
"A bit hard to find at first, but well worth it for the view","The only direction I found to find this place was to get off at Hyehwa station and follow the signs. Walking along I found a sign towards the university to the left and followed Naksan road around until I found a set of steps which took me up a hill. Then from there I followed my instincts and walked straight up a steep road. All up it probably took half an hour's walk from the metro station, possibly less.The views are of the Seoul skyline, which is mainly just skyscrapers and residential tower blocks, but the highlight is the view of N Seoul tower on one side and the fortress wall on the other side. Grabbing a photo with the fortress wall and the satisfaction of reaching the top made the whole thing worth doing.Best of all, it's free entry, and it appeared to be open all hours, so it can be visited day or night. I was there at 3pm on a weekday and the place was empty."
Green respite,"A nice walk from the subway. You will pass by the Street Art Village, it's a quiet serene albeit steep climb up to the fortress wall but well worth the night view. We went around evening time, 7 pm when it was still bright, but the gentle breeze and dipping moon made the walk worthwhile. After the walk, you can walk back to the subway, and there are many eateries and shops due to the universitys located near it."
Recommended who love adventure,"An interesting place to find tranquility. In addition, it is very convenient to spend time with family or friends. accessible by bus or using the subway but need to walk nearly 2 km."
Good place for a stroll,"It leads perfectly on from the top of Ihwa mural village, so we went via the park back down to the main road. We went in mid-summer but there was a wonderful breeze and the weather was beautiful. There is a big pavillion where you can sit and rest and lots of trees for shade. It's a nice escape from the city, would definitely recommend after going to Ihwa mural village, but probably wouldn't make the effort to go just for the park. There are supposed to be nice views at the top but it was a pretty steep climb so we didn't make it there sadly."
Наксан парк good travel,"Thanks. Nice park. Very clean. Have gym, Wi-Fi, gallery. So nice, great. In Seoul Sound Korea. Welcome. "
Peaceful park with a nice fortress walk,"The Seoul city wall walk is highly recommended. If you can't do the whole walk, this makes a good section to choose. You can start at Dongdaemun and walk to Naksan Park and visit the mural village nearby. Naksan Park offers nice views of Seoul. Bring some snacks and get some exercise. This area is clean and safe and offers exercise machines as well."
"Lovely place for a walk, nice night views of Seoul","I visited this place at night and though it was a bit of a walk from nearby Hyehwa station – and a steep climb in some areas – it was good exercise! This area is just great to hang out with friends, exercise, or take your pets for a walk. Also, along the outer perimeter of the area, and further up, along the face of the wall, the views of Seoul are really beautiful, particularly at night."
Nice walk with views of Seoul and art shops,"Nice walk with good views of Seoul, the wall and plenty of art shops where to stock on souvenirs and gifts. Quiet and less crowded than other places in the city."
Nice place to visit,"There's very good place for see the city view. You'll see all of Seoul from there, it's very beautiful."
Good For Morning Exercise n visit the Ihwa Mural Village,It is located next to Ihwa Mural Village and we took the chance to visit the park. We went there in the morning and were able to take a look at the city from above. Expected to have nice view at night but we did not return due to other schedule. 
really nice and relaxing,"we went on sunday morning. It was really quiet. We walked about 1 hour and half. The trail starts next to the Dongdaemoon gate. The trail goes next to many private houses on the hill. I saw locals going home from the trails. It is beautiful during the fall as the trees turn colors. I picked up some nice ginko leaves (the yellow ones). I have never been to this side of Seoul and it was nice to see that in the middle of the city, there is a park and trail. it was beautiful."
Worth visiting both Ihwa Mural Village and Naksan Park at the same time,"Our family of four's primary objective was to explore Ihwa Mural Village. We were busy taking pictures of murals along the narrow and steep road and did not realize that we have reached the entrance of the Park. We saw the staircase leading to the top of the park and decided not to climb up the steps as my elderly family members were a bit tired after walking up the steep road. Nevertheless, we were happy that we have reached here. The air was fresh and had a good view of the city. There were some interesting sculptures in the vicinity and the autumn leaves were beautiful. On our was down, we were thrilled to witness a movie shooting scene in action."
Park with a great night view and easy access to subway station and daehak ro,"I really love this place since its near daehak ro so I can have meals or drinks at the same time. This place was actually a fortress in the past. now it became a park for citizens. it has such a great night view and also near e-hwa painting wall village. If you have more time i recommend you visit both, "
Love it ! ,A good walk from Town to this hilly park which u can see much of Seoul here . The Naksan Art street was fodder to a photographer's dream. Quaint shops n nice autumn leaves along the way . 
Nice Park,"Many drawing on the house and view are nice, also can enjoy the red leaves in seoul when you go with the right timing!!!"
A stunning place ,This place is incredibly beautiful. I recommend this park for everyone. I liked the weather over there because it's so calming and away from Seoul city. I felt the real fresh air in there 
lovely hiking place,a small lovely hiking place in seoul. the pathway follows up the various castle walls leading up to the seoul namsan tower towards the end. amazing little escape from the busy city life.
Bring your drinks,"It's a good park to visit if you bring some drinks at night, don't mind a 20 min steep walk, don't mind a confusing way up, and are already in the area. There are bigger and better mountains. "
Best view place to chill out,"One of my favorite place in Seoul, especially around Jongno and Daehakno(Hyehwa) area. It can be a little tricky to find a way to get there, and a bit demanding to climb. However, once you reach the park, you're gonna admire the view and say wow. The air up there is fresh and clean it's both nice on daytime and nightime. A small tip is, bring a bottle of beer with you(it's legal in Korea to drink outside)."
interesting,Interesting place to visit. I love every part of mural art on the wall. I would to recomend to come here if you like to take picture
Great hiking trip,"It was a beautiful experience, I knew I had to come here during my stay in Seoul. It was a humid and hot day, but with iced water and ice cream, we walked up to the park, and it was lovely and very zen like. There was classical music coming from the speakers, and great views from the top. Conveniently, there's toilets and benches here and there. The city wall was nice to see and we took great pictures from the top. Must see!"
Nice view of Seoul city,Went to this park for a short walk after visiting the mural village. Went to 2 out of the 3 observations points and had a great view of the city. Recommended to come if you're heading up to the mural village.
being part of Naksan tour,"i went to this park because it was some scene of Korean drama.and there is a nearby attraction - a village of wall paintingyou can see the old city wall, but freakly speaking, it is not very attractive.it may look nice to have a night view of seoul city, but i went there at noon. so, it was to bright and hot."
"A short visit, but definitely worth your time","Going up the Naksan hill is not at the top of Seoul's top destinations, but I highly recommend you take the detour and try it anyways. The neighborhood surrounding the hill is very enjoyable (Ihwa, Hyewha, Daehangno), and the park itself is very nice. It says ""park"", but think of it as a small hill or mountain. The park is very clean and the vegetation very nice. You can also walk along the old Seoul city walls and follow them to get back down to (or up from) the city. What is so great about the park is the view. Despite being significantly lower than Namsan tower (and mountain), the views from Naksan are mostly unobstructed, giving you a majestic view of most of Seoul (including Namsan Mountain and Tower). The ""Northern view"" is a bit less spectacular, but nice nonetheless. It probably takes 15 or 20 minutes to walk up to the top of the hill, but the view you get makes it look like you've just climbed for 2 hours."
Panoramic views,"Spectacular way to see the city and surrounding mountains. Hope for a clear day, but it is so ideally located near the palaces, major shopping/tourist areas, close to the subway lines and the really incredible Old City Wall - which you can walk for many kms! Take your time or get some good exercise, but the walk is a little steep, but well worth it. Enjoy this special place in the city!"
Incredible view for zero dollar,"Walk all the way from Hyehwa station up to Naksan Park, is one of my favourite park. If you watch k-drama, this is probably one of the most typical place for filming. Recommend to come around 5pm-6pm. This took me about 40min, very steep slope along the way, no shortcut, and the only way up is the only way down. The route was quite confusing,I end up walking to another station. But the view was incredible and it is filled with those wall arts! Nice place for photography."
Magic hour pic n enjoy noght scenery. ,Magic hour pic n enjoy noght scenery. It is really beautiful at night. You would better go before magic hour and enjoy noght scenery. You need to walk about 20 minutes and about 100 stairs. High season : Summer. Nearby : Ihwa mural village. 
Nice park with a nice city view,A nice park with a nice city view reached by walking through the city walls. This park is usually full of couples and there are always interesting performances and other kinds of shows. It is also a good example of urban transformation since the area was previously a slum.
One of the best night views in Seoul,"Didn't know about this place until recently, and I have to admit that this place has one of the best night views in Seoul. I would recommend this place to anyone living or visiting in Seoul. BTW, don't attempt to park your car too close to the hillside parking lot. It would be better to leave the car on the ground level and to walk from there."
A hard beginning makes a good ending.,"As the title. When u finally climb up to the highest place of the park, I'll see a beautiful view of Seoul. I suggest that you can go there by the evening and u'll see the beautiful view with the romantic sunlight. it's a great place really!!!"
Slow the pace and enjoy the view,If you are looking to slow the pace and to relax or engage in light exercise Naksan Park is a nice respite. It is a place where you can sit and talk and enjoy the views of the city from hills of the park. There is a circuit with outdoor exercise equipment that some of the locals use on a regular basis. Probably a good place to take the kids and let them burn off some energy but then to just slow everything down. The overall setting is peaceful and refreshing. There is a fortress wall leading to the ancient east gate of the city. You get to see a wide spectrum of Seoul as you navigate from the park to the alleys and streets around the east gate. Easily reached by the No. 4 subway line.
Nice Gem of a Park Near the Palace Quarter,"We found this great park near where we were staying in the Palace Quarter. It has superb views of different parts of Seoul, a fortress wall partially surrounded it, and some lovely trails. It's definitely worth a stroll on a beautiful afternoon. And right outside of the park is a cool, funky neighborhood that they call ""Mural Village"" because of the gorgeous murals painted on the buildings. Mural Village and Naksan Park will make a splendid day out in Seoul."
Nice Park,"We passed by Naksan Park on our way to the Naksan Neighbourhood in search of the Backlane Alley Street Art. The Park is located on a hill and overlooks the city. The view is good, and the flowers were blooming the day we were there. The weather was great and we had a very good morning walk."
Breathtaking views,"We were actually trying to find the street where loads of artwork on the walls and floors/stairs but did not find it, however, we did walk everywhere around Naksan Park and we really loved the views it gives if the quieter part if the city compared to the modernised parts of Seoul. We think it will take around 3 hours to walk around, however, you reall could make a day of it."
Follow old wall surrounding city limits...,"Old Seoul had become a capital city due to its strategic location. River (Han) to the south, and mountain ranges surrounding the city. Naksan is one of the mountains that protects the old Seoul city and thus you can view the restored city walls when you visit this site. The park itself it not a hugely impressive sight other than there is a really nice view of the city from observation points. Recommend following the path that follows the old wall, explore the little gates and also neighborhood right below which was saved due to the interesting murals put up by the locals (they were supposed to be under city renewal and taken down). If you follow the wall path all the way, you land yourself in front of East gate of Seoul."
Naksan Park and surrounding residential Ihwadong Mural,"Actually, we followed a guidebook and were actually searching for those famous murals by residents when we came across this park. The small park entrance has a big granite dragon and at first we wanted to give it a miss. But luckily, we went around and there is an very interesting museumn that shows the development of the area. After a walk, the frontier wall (only a short stretch is left) has very nice view and is very windy. Searching for those murals is like treasure hunting. You will never know what you will see at the next corner. After all, it is a residential area and we have all the time to pose and take pictures, yet being able to watch the normal way of life of Ihwadong residents. Highly recommended if you wanna try something different from the usual touristy area."
