Beautiful at night,"The lake is very popular in spring with its cherry blossoms. In autumn it is a lot quieter. Walking around the lake at night is very relaxing. Getting to the lake is quite easy by subway. Just get off at Jamsil Station and take Exit 2 (of the subway). Turn left a bit and cross the road. That takes you to Exit 1 of the Express Bus Terminal; there is a small walkway down to the left side of the lake. If you cross the road to the opposite side, it is Exit 2 of the Express Bus Terminal; a small walkway on the side takes you to the right side of the lake (with the Lotte fun park). To the first timer, it can be confusing after getting out of Exit 2 (of the subway) to see another Exit 2 after you cross to the opposite road corner."
Beautiful in Spring,"This park is a must to visit in Spring! It is accessible by train, we alighted the station near the Lotte World Mall and had our lunch first. Flowers blooming everywhere and cover the whole Lake. We also can see the Lotte World Theme Park from the park. We spent walking around 1 hour to cover the whole lake - there are 2 sides of the lake."
A Must Place to Be To Catch Cherry Blossom,"The cherry blossom trees covered the whole Seokchon Lake, go there early to avoid the crowd if you want to take pictures. Seokcho Lake is situated next to Lotto Shopping Mall.Remember to bring extra warm jacket because the lake is windy and cold during spring. "
"Nice place for cherry blossom, but crowded ","Went there during lunch hour, very crowded. But the view of the lake with cherry blossom is fantastic and Romantic. You can also view the Lotte tower next to it. Don’t miss this if you go to that area. "
Romantic place wd cherry blossom!!,"If you will be in Seoul around Apr, this place is a must see.Full of cherry blossom!! Very romantic and beautiful!"
Seokchonhosu Lake - Songpa Naru,"At Songpa-gu, Seokchon Lake, a must visit to the Songpa Naru , the 1000 meters path around the lake side , with arrays of cherry blossoms along both side of the path. To visit during the evening time - another exotic experience to view the blooming flowers. Also, to see the scenic view of 120 floor Lotte World Tower at night time. "
Enjoying Cherry Blossom Festival,Beautiful scenery with cherry blossom tree around the lake. Very crowded and better to come earlier. Lotte world theme park with a castle makes it more beautiful like fairy tales. There is a cafe inside. One of the top must visit during spring season in Seoul.
Cherry Blossom festival ,Early April untill 11st April 2019 National Cherry Blossom Festival (벗꽃축제 beojk-koch-chug-je ) every year is different day please check before come. Next to the highest tower in Korea called ”Lotte world tower” also close by Lotte world I went to the lake on 8 April not too crowded they have some show also the stuff for sale along the lakeside.
Leisurely stroll + cherry blossoms,"This is my second time visiting Seokchon Lake. The first time was in June 2017 after Lotte World Tower had been opened to the public. This time, the sakura season was right on and Seokchon Lake is one of the hot spots to view cherry blossoms. I avoided Sunday and went on a Monday, but still there were many people (a week- long sakura festival was on). The flowers there were mostly white. I walked around the east lake, and Lotte World Tower is particularly photogenic with cherry blossoms all around. In the evening, when the lights were turned on, it's another atmosphere.Outside the sakura season, the lake is a nice place to stroll around leisurely."
Cherry Blossom Festival,"Lovely cherry blossoms during the Festival in April. However, I did think the whole atmosphere was somewhat spoilt by the presence of the Lotte amusement park in the middle of the lake, complete with various park rides!"
Far and Worth It,"It was one hour away from where I stayed, Hongdae but it was all worth it. Went there first week of April and center of Seoul didnt have bunch of cherry blossoms so I was kinda disappointed until I went to Seokchon Lake. It was the best thing that met my eyes that week. Must go-to when you visit Seoul in Spring."
Pretty in the midst of cherry blossoms,"Go for a leisure walk at Seokchon Lake ~ especially now during the spring. If you are here, go while the 2019 Cherry Blossom Festival is on for another few days. The walk is easy, paved and wheelchair accessible. There are cafes and food stands, and Lotte World Mall is next to the lake of course (and the Tower). There are benches and performances going on, so you can sit and relax and enjoy. In the evening, the lights go on illuminating the lake and the tower."
Cherry Blossoms and a lovely walk,"Dropped by here today while out for a city walkabout. It was crowded but the lake is lovely in the spring weather and the blossoms, well.. you have to go see them."
Great for leisurely walk,"The lake is most attractive in early April, with the lakeside lined with handsome cherry blossoms. In autumn, however, it is less attractive, despite some red autumn leaves lining the lake. I like to visit the lake around sunset, because it is the most romantic time. For the first timers it is quite difficult to find the entrance to the lake. The lake is sort of divided by a road bridge above, but one could walk around the lake from any entrance. I like to take Exit 2 of the Jamsil metro station, then turn left and walk alongside Lotte Hotel, until the road junction. Cross the road and then cross again, to reach the diagonally opposite road corner; the access path to the lake and the coffee shop is right there (next to another ""Exit 2""). This second Exit 2 is for the Bus Transfer Station and not for the metro. The confusion for the first timer is that there are two ""Exit 2"" entrances. It took me a while to work it out."
"Beautiful, especially during spring time!","This was the place that made me fall in love with Seoul all over again. We visited as the cherry blossoms were in full bloom. It was one for the books - sitting at the cafe drinking coffee, and witnessing petal storms while people watching. What a gem of a park this is. At the time we went, there was a musical performance to be held there. Quite a shame we couldn't stay too long."
What a gem of a place,"I went to Seokchon twice in the past few weeks. I went at the end of May and then again at the beginning of June. I loved it and will surely be going again. What a gem of a place - so peaceful and pretty 8n the hustle and bustle of Jamsil. There are coffee shops right there, and also many places to have a drink or eat out around the lake just across the street. The walking path along the lake is carpeted, this the ground is rely soft and comfortable to walk on, especially for me as I just started getting back to walking after my long ankle injury (broken ankle). I love how close it is to World Tower and World Mall, yet while at the lake it doexnt even feel like being in Seoul. 100% recommending it! "
Beautiful park with great views,"Great views of Lotte Tower, the 5th highest building in the world and very nice to stroll around. Come on a nice day and enjoy. Plenty of restaurants along the way."
Good place to exercise!,"It is a nice place which has many machines to train , and after training, there is a road around lake I can run for 40min. Also the place is nearby the lotto world, there is a beautiful view in the middle of the lake. If I can come again, I must bring my girlfriend here. 這是個很棒的地方，裡面的公園就有重訓器材，可以做免費的訓練，也促進韓國人民的健康，在這做完訓練後還可以沿著湖邊的路跑步，很大一圈，沿途的風景也很漂亮，因為鄰近樂天世界，所以有許多情侶們在這約會，有機會再來的話我一定要帶自己的女友到這！"
Park walking season,I recommend to be visited during both autumn and spring when the weather is nice. The night view of Lotte complex including Lotte tower from the park is really stunning. I recently visited during cherry blossom season in the evening. The cherry trees are surrounded by special light which makes the walking more interesting.
I live near this lake. Amazing.,"You like walking? You like watching ducks swim? This is your place. A miraculous little spot right in the center of a concrete jungle - Seokchon Lake. When you visit during the spring, you will see truly amazing cherry blossom."
Park and Lake,"A pretty place, nice for walking. Enjoy the sceneries.You can also enjoy the autumn colors.You can see Lotte World too."
"Nice, wide walking paths and park area with a pretty view of the lake","I recently visited Seokchon Lake for the cherry blossom festival and found it to be one of the prettiest places in the city to see the blooms. Our group enjoyed taking photos and having a comfortable stroll on the nice, wide walking paths around the lake. We observed large carp swimming in the lake under the bridge. It was a fun afternoon and very peaceful, despite being fairly crowded for the festival."
Cherry Blossoms,"What a beautiful place to visit during the cherry blossoms season.It is a very cosy and comfortable place. Walk around the lake is very refreshing. Although there were lots of people, there is still lots of room. I saw people enjoy their lunch at the table outdoor under the cherry blossoms. Such a good idea to enjoy the lake. It's never hard to find a place to rest, to sit down, to find washroom. Visit the tour centre, there is friendly staff to help you navigate the area and the city. Plus, there is Korean traditional clothes inside for you to take photos. Good for elderly and babies on strollers Maybe you can buy a cup of coffee at the cafe at tour centre to enjoy the view.Suddenly, a breeze blew up the cherry petals. What a lovely scene of pink cherry petals rain. I traveled with my mom. Dear Tripadvisor, I suggest you to add one category, Family ( with eldery)"
"Sweet swans at Seokchon Lake, Jamsil","So amazing place and attraction in the Seokchon Lake - a couple of Swans and their little babies ) April is so gorgeous in Seoul. Sakura, flower, love, family happiness in the air "
BEAUTIFUL!,"We were lucky to have been able to come here during the cherry blossom season. The walkways are lined with the blossoms surrounding the lake. I also noticed an orchestra around the bend (Obviously, I wouldn't assume this is regularly there) but it added to the great atmosphere of the place."
Beautiful & Romantic Cherry Blossoms Along The Lake,"We visited Seokchon Lake during full bloom season of the Cherry Blossoms. Though it was a Sunday afternoon and was extremely crowded, the visit was worth it when you consider the row after row of cherry blossom trees against the backdrop of the lake. It was beautiful!Not meant for those who just want a quiet spot to admire the cherry blossoms. But the whole ambience is really that of a carnival or festival filled with throngs of crowds and performances and street food; that is its attraction. A must visit during Cherry Blossom season. :)Seokchon Lake is accessible by subway at the Jamsil station, exit 2. From the exit station, its a short 5 minute walk out of the Lotte World shopping complex and to the adjacent lake."
Sweet Swan Project @ Seokchon Lake,"We came down here to see the Sweet Swan project. Glad that we did, and we manage to see cherry blossom. Good to pop by here if you are nearby here.Just a 10 -15 mins walk from Jamsil subway station."
Amazingly beautiful lake!,"The lake was not big and the trail around it was easy to walk. When we were there, the cherry blossom was in fully bloom which turned the lake into white and light pink, and I have to say it was amazingly beautiful! We enjoyed the beauty of the lake and the cherry blossom by walking 3 rounds around the lake. Highly recommend to visit it during the cherry blossom season!"
Seokchon Lake and more- all in one place,"Cherry blossoms, food truck, rock concert and an opportunity to see or climb the tallest building in Korea, the Lotte World Tower, the world's 5th tallest building!!! - all in one place: SEOKCHON LAKE. Right about now is when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom at Seokchon Lake. While you're there strolling, don't forget to check out the food trucks and the free concerts. If you can't make it during the day, don't worry, there's lighting on each and every tree so that people can enjoy the blooms even at night."
Cherry Tree Blossom Festival ,Went to Seokchon Lake as all the Cherry Trees are in full bloom. It was very beautiful as the paved path has Cherry Trees on both sides. There is actually two small lakes that is connected and makes for a good walk around both of them. Also you can see Lotte World and the newly open Lotte World Tower which is now the 5th highest Tower in the world. Lots of people with families and couples enjoying the blossoms and taking pictures. It's right across the street from Lotte Mall and it has a huge food court. Highly recommend the walk around the lake and seeing the sites at the same time. Very close to Jasmil Subway station.
Jewel,"A beautiful, breathtaking, soothing the eyes' park. Best to visit during the cherry blossom season. 200m away from Jamsil Station Exit 2 or with Lotte Mall on your left, walk straight for 5-10mins until you reach the intersection. You will see the park after the trafic light."
Good trail course.. calm small lake in downtown.,"C1 ( 2017.03.21 ) This lake was small size and located beside Lotte World area. Many villager took a walk for health and the atmosphere was calm and quiet. There was nothing to do, but good to take a walk quietly. If you visit Lotte Tower Mall, it is good to walk around this lake."
Lake in Jamsil,Small and nice lake by the Lotte World. The Super Moon is a good spot for pictures. Pretty famous around the area
Super Moon!,"I went here recently just to see the Super Moon floats on the lake, it was like an art exhibition by Los Angeles-based artists Samuel Borkson and Arturo Sandoval III. The exhibition only last for 1 month (Sept 1- Oct 3 2016). To reach here, alight at Jamsil Station (exit 1), and walk around 5mins by following the signboard. The moon itself will lights up starting from 6pm until 10pm everyday. During that time, this area was so crowded with peoples came here to see the lights changes colour for 4hours. But to avoid the crowd, I came here during the day, lol. Few pictures with the moon is enough for me, plus I got to do some morning walk around the lake too."
Super moon event!!!,"Here is just a recreation area in a high developed city center. Green trees with a walking way around a beautiful calm lake. But nowadays there is an event like last year's rubber duck, so if you will be in Seoul till first week oct. You must surely see it. Ps : really really crowded !!!"
Cherry blossoms beautifully embroidering the city!,"Do visit Seokchon Lake when its Cherry Blossom is on! The cherry blossom festival - event normally takes place during early to mid April, when cherry blossoms are beautifully embroidering the city. In addition, a variety of performances, exhibitions, and hands-on activities will take place during the festival period."
