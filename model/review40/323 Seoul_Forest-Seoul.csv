Best to go in autumn,"Seoul Forest is easily accessible by subway. Change at Wangsimni to go to Seoul Forest Station (K211). After exiting the toll-gate, there is a lift at the end of the floor to take you to the street level. Turn left and then right to enter Under Stand Ave. There is a good eating shop on your left. Cross the road to enter Seoul Forest. Last year, the autumn colours were stunning but because of the long summer and dryness this year the ginkgo and maple trees were somewhat disappointing. It is still a good place to walk."
Just OK,"Huge garden with performances on some days, without which, there isn't much to see. A lot of green and few flowers when we visited in early October. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to visit this place. There are more scenic nature walks closer to the city. "
Great moment ,"I went to Seoul forest to enjoy the weather with a friend. the place was really nice, we almost forgot that we were right in the center of Seoul. the weather was perfect and the leaves in the orange color of autumn were perfect. short a good time, I recommend this park."
Beautiful outdoor space,Wonderful place to spend a beautiful day. There are tons are walking paths and benches. The park is filled on the weekend. You can rent bikes and ride around the perimeter of the park. There is a lot of shade.
A bit cold but Great time!,"I visited Seoul and really enjoyed the time with my friends. We stayed in the capital for 2 nights and explored some famous sites there: Gyeongbokgung Palace, Bukchon Hanok Old Village, Seoul Stadium... shopping at Myeongdong was a must and tasted street foods there which would give us happy time for the trip. "
Relaxing Day,A great place to walk around and enjoy some space from the hustle and bustle of Seoul. A very child friendly environment.
Nice walk in the city,It's an oasis in Seoul. Walking in this park/mini forest really makes you think you're out in the country side. It's very relaxing and enjoyable. Many attraction for kids as well. Great for outdoor activities.
A very nice large park,"Came here for a walk with our toddler, and had lots of fun. A great big playground, a little corner with some water-themed equipment nearby. Deer feeding was prohibited, not sure if permanent or temporary... Large territory to explore with lots of pretty views and photo opportunities. Not sure it's a good option as a tourist destination, but if you want to spend some time with kids in a park and explore the territory, then it's the place to go."
beautiful park in the middle of city,"There are 2 subway stations nearby the park. one is green line and the other is yellow if i'm not mistaken. I think the yellow line is nearer than the green line. This park is not so crowded, we came around 6.30 pm and had a great time enjoying cherry blossom."
Nice Place to Relax,"We visited Seoul Forest early to feel the morning breeze since the temperature when we visited was still around 9deg. As the name implies, it is a big place. There are so many areas to visit but it takes a lot of walking to reach each part. And some directions won’t lead you to what is indicated. The only area we enjoyed most was the Tulip Garden where flowers are in bloom and in different happy colors. There are even cherry blossom trees in between. It felt refreshing and very calming. If you are a nature lover, you can try and visit Seoul Forest."
Beautiful sea of tulips ,"This was my second visit to Seoul Forest. I went on Saturday and I was surprised how many beautiful tulips there were still blooming at the tulip garden. The park was crowded, but it was still leisurely and I enjoyed my time. I will return in the fall for the foliage. Definitely, check this place out if you are looking to spend a leisurely day out. There are a lot of cafes and restaurants surrounding the park, as well some snack places on the premises."
Calm place in Metro city... Well-managed park.,"C ( 19.04.23 ) I visited this park after lunch for walking. The park was well-managed and bigger than I think. I walked around in the park, there had many flowers, trees, and sculpture. There was good place to had relax time and to walk leisurely in Metro city. The smell and view of tulip was very good to me. Though this park was located near my office, but I didn't visit till one year past. I'll visited sometimes after lunch. Very good park in Seoul."
Seoul Forest Spring Visit,"Early spring visit, where trees and flowers just started to blossom. This is one of the best parks I've ever visited.Fresh air and cool breeze! I call it Forest in the middle of the city. "
Large park. Bad time of the year to visit,"It’s still pretty cold in Seoul and the park was full of dead trees and grass. The winter chill has prevented anything from growing and no one but a few elderly were walking in the park. I trust the reviews of my fellow TripAdvisor users that this park is great during the warmer parts of the year. The park has paid parking, and easy access from the subway station. Buses do also frequently stop at Seoul Forest. The restroom is cleaned regularly and well maintained. "
Nice walk around the park,"If you're staying somewhere along Apkujung or Cheongdam, this park is just across the river on Seong-su bridge. Nice place to go for a run."
cool place,I went in spring so it was really chill bring your mat and food to picnic and chill there! the cherry blossoms were in full bloom really just gorgeous !
Beautiful autumn colors,"In autumn, Seoul Forest becomes magical as the various trees change into yellow, orange and red. The weather is cool so it is more pleasant to walk around.The forest is easy to reach by the Seoul subway. At the Seoul Forest station, use the lift near Exit 3 to reach the ground level. Turn right and then left into Under Stand Avenue. I spent some hours in the forest, exploring the various parts. From the entrance, I kept to the right of the forest as the trees on that side were particularly colorful.The weather was cold, so the bird corner at the far right was empty. Then I turned back to the rear of the forest where the Ginkgo Road, under the afternoon sun, was absolutely absorbing. From there I passed under two bridges on my right to reach the Deer Corner (with spotted deer). Later I returned to the entrance, passing by the lake. I spent over 4 hours there, totally absorbed by its beauty in autumn. The forest is huge hence it is important to plan your walking route beforehand."
Quiet and pretty park to walk in,"We enjoy walking in city parks and this one has sculptures, a deer consul, insect and butterfly gardens (although the latter sections are bare bones in October.) If you have children, there are some good play structures, slides and lots of free space to run around in. "
A silence from busy Seoul,"This park is well managed and a great place to enjoy autumn of South Korea. If you want a silence from the busy city of Seoul, this place is where you should be. Check out pork BBQ shops nearby as well."
Lovely park,"I really wanted to see a deer as I've never encountered one before. I went to the park and the weather was perfect. There were also children on a trip the day I visited. We fed the deer via a vending machine that sold food for the deer and I honestly enjoyed this experience.For a tourist though I can understand that this isn't something everyone would enjoy. My mother didn't even bother coming with me as she found it 'boring' but I really enjoy long walks and just sitting down, people watching."
Family walk,"This is a park and not really a forest as the name suggested. There are many areas to sit around and have picnic, This is a park where locals will go and have their week end family picnic or gathering. Nothing much for the tourists."
nice,"Beautiful park to go to, if you have time visit this place for sure. you forget that you are in a city when you walk there"
Nice and beautiful,"I went in early October. The trees beginning to change colour from green to orange. Very relaxing, beautiful and calming."
Peace and quiet after the noise of the city.,"I always enjoy getting out into fresh air and be amongst trees. Worth the train travel to reach this lovely spot. Walking paths good. Relax and rejuvenate with the peaceful surroundings. A few deer in an enclosure sure to delight. You can walk all the way to the main Han River with great views of city. Basic cafe on site, but you can bring your own food and enjoy anywhere in the park area. We loved our visit."
Good for picnic and bicycle,"If you look for the place for picnic and bicycle around eastern area of Seoul, this is the proper place to go. You can rent a bicycle or can bring yours. It’s good for walk and have rest throughout the day. "
A little but tricky to navigate but very enjoyable park,"Lovely park with fun slides and play areas for kids, interesting areas like the deer corral and insect rooms, and lots of lovely greenery. Some of the signage had us looping around trying to get to certain areas and I ended up having to use GPS map to get to some parts."
Oasis for locals. Don't expect much as a tourist attraction.,"This is a very large park in Seoul. People who live in Seoul come and rest here. Many family visitors. It's not bad for tourists. But, there's nothing fantastic.- The entrance from the east seems to be main gate with a parking lot. 10~15 min walk from Seoul Forest Metro Station(Bundang Line).- Huge park. Bicycle rental is recommended to take a look quickly. Ttareungi(Seoul Bike) is much cheaper than bike rental shops.- Tourists may have enough fun when there's an event like a concert.- Snack bar on the west is not cheap. They have good snacks like squids, potatoes, sausages, etc., though.- There are rabbit farms, carp ponds, deer farms, butterfly farms, greenhouse, etc."
Bigger than I had expected ,"This park was lovely, with beautiful greenery, landscaping as well as architecture. Managed to take some nice shots. Wasn’t too crowded on a Tuesday morning. Worth a visit. "
Butterfly Garden,"Went Seoul for an incentive trip and got a half day free on the last day.So I decided to go Seoul Forest to see butterflies. I went there by taxi and walked around in the large park, finally got into the butterfly garden.I’ve already able to see a lot of butterflies outside the butterfly garden.It’s a good experience to learn ecological in other countries"
Nice Place for a Walk,"It is a very modest place where mostly elders go to exercise. There are also deers that you can feed by buying their food from a vending machine. There is also a piano for the public that anyone can use. However, you will not find much activities to do especially during the weekends."
Disappointing at best,"There's just nothing much to do here and a whole lot of bugs. There is, however, a public piano, if you can play"
walk in the heat,lovely place especially when its hot. lots of places to cool down rest and enjoy the sound of trees. Allow atleast 4 hours to find all there is ...and there is loads for children and adults to enjoy
A nice tranquil park in middle of city,"This park is vast, quiet and has a few interesting gardens such as butterfly, insect and deer garden. My kid has a good time there."
charm place,"Espeasialy in aoutumn very lovely views with the color full of the treas , if there is wind you can see the leaves fill down like a rain oh i love it."
Beautiful Park,"We went to Seoul Forest on a Sunday morning. It was accessible by subway, and there were many families with young children in the park playground and strolling around. The place was clean and well maintained, and there were bikes and four wheelers available for rent. We rented a few although they were quite pricey, and we had an hour of fun biking around the huge park. The weather was cloudy and cool, perfect for playing on the lawn. We brought along a frisbee and inflatable ball, and had a great time playing together. There were also cafes and restaurants nearby and we had lunch there. We walked to the Deer enclosure to view the deers, but the feed for the animals were already sold out by the time we reach (around 3pm). Nonetheless, we had a great day at Seoul Forest and it is a great place for a family outing."
1st time to Seoul Forest,"I enjoyed walking around Seoul Forest. It was my first time visiting and I was surprised to see how big it was yet so easily accessible. Lots of paths to walk on and spaces to rest in the shade. There are plenty of benches, picnic tables and common sitting areas. Many people were also enjoying their picnic on the grass. A nice place for a family day or just for anyone who wishes to be in the nature in the midst of the city. With all the different trees, I think it will be lovely there in the fall."
Beautiful cherry blossoms in early April,"It was raining during my visit so there were no many visitors. The place is not difficult to find but it is advisable to research for it on internet before you go. From the Seoul Forest metro station, there is a lift that takes you to the ground level. From the lift exit turn right and then left into the "" Under Stand Avenue"", a short street with shops built from metal containers. If you are hungry there is a noodle shop with reasonable prices. Once in the forest, you can find the cherry blossom road on the left. The cherry blossom trees are large and they flower in early April."
Great park,"The place is serene. If you want to relax, exercise and take great photos, this park is one of the many places to be in Seoul. I would love to go biking someday around this beautiful place. Went there before spring comes to full bloom, but it was still gorgeous."
Such a gorgeous park in the middle of Seoul ,"A must see place if you have time in Seoul. The place is good for picnics and families to enjoy the spring weather and greenery. Further in, you can see deers and rabbits etc in the park. The cherry blossom trees lined the entire stretch inside which was beautiful. Great place for photos. "
Meet some deer,"Ok to walk through and some sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of the cityThere are deer to look at as well. They are in an enclosure, but they come up to the fence. You can buy deer food for 1000 won from a vending machine. However when we went (close to sunset) the vending machine was closed for the day."
Very nice park,Came here for spring and it was a great sight as the park is lined with alot of flowers. Park is quite big and didn't manage to explore around. Best to go in the morning before it gets too crowded. Defn recommended for those that likes to go for a stroll or a walk. Located near to subway station - Seoul Forest- .
A necessary moment of peace and calm during a visit to a busy city.,"I took a walk through Seoul Forest in February. Despite most of the plants being brown and dormant for the winter, I enjoyed the quiet and the design of the park. I can only imagine how much more wonderful it would be in the warmer months. With all of the activity in a busy city like Seoul, this park offers a moment to walk, talk, think, and rest before heading of to the next activity. In winter, go at least to take a walk. In the warmer months, plan to stay awhile longer and sit or play."
Very peaceful place,We went there for a quick walk on the last day of our trip. Seoul forest is located pretty much in city center and is easily accessible. It was very nice to walk around the park in a peaceful quite atmosphere. 
Great day in the forest ,Wow ! In a busy city it’s a wonderful getaway. We really enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere of the forest in a city. I highly recommend it. 
Lovely all year round,"Very nice big park. Lots of space for a picnic now the weather turns warmer as well. If you like deer, make sure to go see them. The ""understand avenue"" is also worth a visit if looking for a nice beer or handmade goods."
Cozy but tiny,"It is very clean, with beautiful artworks installed here and there. However being a Russian I could not call it a forest... For forest is something massive, at least when you cannot see the end of the forest upon entering. Seoul forest is sort of park to me, a tiny island of nature - I would say."
Favourite place in South Korea,"Seoul Forest is underrated but it’s my favourite place in South Korea especially because we went there on the middle of Autumn. It was beautiful and just provides you all the romantic —or otherwise dramatic— ambiance. With all the trees wearing different colours. Besides the deer park, my favourite place is the small stadium with a piano at the center. Make sure you practice your piano pieces before going here. It will be a memory you’ll definitely keep."
Nice park - lots of art ,"I took the train here - very easy and cheap. Train station is only a 5 min walk to park. This park is very large, I probably spent 2 hours walking around it taking pictures. There are pretty birds; trees; art sculptures everywhere; deer corral; insect exhibit and tropical garden centre and more. Give yourself time, perhaps pack a lunch (though lots of good cafes around) and enjoy the space. I was happy I went (tskuem station on line 2 is what you want for the park) "
Simple but cute,"Actually, we expected more from that place but it's still really cute. You can have a walk there with your partner/family/friends/dog, etc. It's convenient and it gives some calm even though it's in Seoul"
Great place to take kids,"Beautiful park, great place for the kids to run around and exercise. They have very unusual playground equipment, wonderful stuff I've seen no where else. The insect garden was cool and we all loved feeding the deer. Easy to get to by the metro."
Went to see the deer with a friend,My friend took me to Seoul Forest and we spent half a day there. It was a huge park and there were deers.
beeeeautiful!,"you cannot go wrong with a trip here! if youre in s. korea, and within an hour or so drive... youll not be disappointed in any way! i would have driven 2-3 hours to see this beaute'"
"Beautiful, peaceful",Seoul Forest is a beautiful spot in the middle of the city. I visited in November and the weather was perfect. The cool temperatures coupled with the autumn leaves made it one of my favourite spots in Seoul. Be sure to bring a camera to take lots of pictures. There is also a shipping container shopping center near by.
A ROMANTIC PLACE,I would definitely go back there.. One of my favorite place in korea.. too cold but that's fine i enjoyed the romantic ambiance of the place❤️
A Fantastic Place Hidden Among the Skyscrapers,"I have been to Seoul Forest several times and it's been relaxing and refreshing every time. It can get pretty busy on the weekends, but still not too bad when compared to other parks in Seoul.pro tip: cherry blossoms are amazing here, best in Seoul (imo)! However, you have to walk across tukseom and gosanja intersection to get to them."
"One for the ""Seoul-on-a-budget"" itinerary","Seoul forest which is 5min walk via Seoul metro (seoul forest station, Bundang line) is located close to the city. On approaching the park, there was a communal city veggie farm. It is free entry into the park and bicycles can be rented near the entrance.This large park which can be seen from Namsan Tower, housed Seoul's first water purification plant. The purification plant which is still active can be visited in the park. In addition to the purification plant, there were other attractions such as the Cultural Art park, butterflies and insect garden (there was a rabbit pen close to the butterfly garden), deer feeding at the Ecology forest or just strolling through the park.There are several convenience stores in the park selling snacks, coffee, ice cream, etc. Toilet and washroom facilities also available."
Nature in the middle of a busy city!,"Great place for a change of scenery! The forest isn't that big, but it is full of at least an hours worth of things to look at! I was there in June and the weather in Seoul was hot and very humid but, the trees in the forest provided a lot of shade."
Amazing forest in city town,"In front of my house It's very lucky to have this kind of park near my housewith Metro station, easy to access to Gangnam and City center.bicycle rental available"
Good good^^,I always visited there when i’m in Seoul. There is such a calm place in a big city. It is a good place to take a rest. I can enjoyed my autumn with colorful leaves. I will go back again and again. 
Best for autumn visit,There is a food truck area upon the station exit. You get to visit here during autumn season for the ginko leaves.
Nice to visit in Spring and Autumn,"One of the nicer places to visit in Spring or Autumn for its cherry blossom or fall folliage in Seoul. Visited there in Autumn and wasn’t disappointed at all. It’s like forest bathing, you get to soak in nature and spend some relaxing time in the forest. Great for families, couples and even solo travelers to visit!"
Nice for walking,"Trees flower etc.You can feed the deer and enjoy leisure walking.Not crowded, you can enjoy the view."
Very beautiful ,Some amazing colours here. Pinks and reds. Had a wondeful walk around. Can feed the deers or just sit and think. Fresh air and clean nature. Highly recommend this. It's wonderful. Seoul forest metro station. See if you can find the black cat that lives here. Decent snack bar too. Had the fried potatoes 
A large park with some colourful gardens (at the right time).,"This was on my list of places to see to complete my 'I've seen most of Seoul' list. While it was a pleasant afternoon I would have said the park was a bit of an anti-climax. If you live in Seoul it would probably provide a great opportunity to get back to nature, but as an Australian it was like many of our 'parks'."
"If you have a free day, good for couples.","Not comparable to Bukhansan, but nice for a day trip, if you have time to spare. I loved the atmosphere change and the good time. Worth it."
Interesting get away,"We went there with 2 other families, together there are 6 children and 6 adults. My younger daughter enjoyed the cycling. However, I find that the bicycle was not very stable. One of the other kids had fallen off the bicycle when riding. But in the forest there is a big playground which the kids enjoyed very much. They also enjoyed seeing the deer. We saw a lot of locals having picnic which I can understand why subsequently as there is not much eating places."
Forest,Big forest. Good weather makes this the perfect place to relax. The location isn't best but is a healthy environment for families and also couples
Lovely weather makes for.. ,"A lovely bike ride around the park. Seoul Forest is hugeee! If u skateboard, there's also a skatepark with ramps and halfpipes."
Fabulous large park with 5 distinct sections,"This is a great park for visitors of all ages to enjoy the outdoors for free. The Seoul Forest park has 5 distinct sections and is too large to see all of it in one day. There are nice, wide paths for walkers and bicyclists. We found the park to be extremely clean and well-landscaped. Bring your camera and a picnic lunch! There is also an impressive schedule of concerts and performances to see at various venues throughout the park if you like to plan in advance. We like to go simply for nature walks and find something new to do at each visit. One of our favorite discoveries was a large observation area where visitors can see different types of deer up close. "
Forest,the forest is clean but not so much to see except feel the good breeze of the air and so good to travel on spring season 
Forest is an exaggeration!,"Disappointed by the 'forest' that was really an urban park. The eco wetlands were disappointing- just a little patch of water with a wooden boardwalk through it. It's a large area with different themes- there's a sports area, picnic areas, eco areas.... Wasn't what I was expecting! "
Serene and Deer,"Nice place to take a stroll, feed some deer, look at the Han River, and go on a picnic among the grass, trees, and water."
Nice park in seoul,"Nice park suitable for whole family have picnic at here. The park is very big, also have some animal you can see. Go there at the sunset almost can see the good view. And can spend one whole day in there. If you have time, this is the good choice to go to enjoy this relax place."
Tanquil ,This is a large area of paths and trees in the middle of Seoul. Having visited in February there wasn't as much happening as there would be at other times of the year and the trees and fauna was dormant. However I would love to see it in the spring. The area was very peaceful although we could hear the traffic in the background. We saw the deer through the fence but the corral wasn't open when we went. 
Nice & Peaceful Garden in the Middle of Seoul,It's a very nice & big garden in the middle city of Seoul. You can enjoy morning walk or evening walk. A lot of nice things to look around. You will see a stunning view during the autumn .... colorful leaves. Enjoy your day with some nice books here.
Beautiful and big park in Seoul,"Very big park / forest in Seoul. You can feed deers, talk around. It's just like a forest, but you do get urban and traffic noise. A must go. One of the few green attractions in Seoul."
Enjoyed Seoul Forest more than Seoul city,"This was very nice to find in the huge city of Seoul. A nice peaceful place, not just another mega shopping mall. We enjoyed our visit in October 2016. We walked through the forest and enjoyed the fall trees, though they were just starting to turn. We really enjoyed feeding the deer. The butterfly house only had one species of butterfly so that was a bit disappointing. The forest is easy to get to using the subway. Weather was warm enough to just wear a t-shirt with a sweater over top. Ideal for all ages. There are play areas on site for those with children."
Nice walk in the park,"Located in the outskirt of town, this forest is a great place to wind down and stroll amongst nature. It provides great landscape for photographs too. The park features a butterfly garden, deer enclosure (you can feed them too if you purchase the feed at the vending machine for 1000 Won). There are birds flying around. There are water features which works on a season with rainfall. The forest also connects to Hangang Park and river view. Follow the map to enjoy a great stroll.Bundang (yellow) train line. Seoul Forest.Entrance of forest is at the back of the carpark."
Seoul has a firest,"Seoul has a forest? Yes and it's wonderful. Enjoyed our walk, fed the deer, went to the museum. It was great!"
The oasis of peace,"The Seoul Forest amidst the hustle and bustle of the city is a surprise. The well-planned eco forest is a must do for adults and kids. The play area is innovative, the deer park also serves as a good attraction. But the best part of the forest is the walk among the foliage and the bridge which takes you from forest to harbour front. I loved the planning, the thinking and the cleanliness of the place."
Awe-inspiring beauty,"It was autumn when we visited this place. Never expect that it was so beautiful and peaceful. It's even more beautiful than Nami Island. There were only few people or tourists in this park and that's what I love about it. If you want to feel the autumn vibes in Seoul, this is a must visit place with so many autumn trees in different colors."
Oasis in the city,"It felt a bit weird to be in a lush garden with high rise office buildings in the background, but this place is well worth a visit to chill out and take a break from the city. Aside from various gardens and forests, there is also an insect display and butterfly garden. There is also a convenience store on site. The forest is easily accessed via Seoul Forest subway station. There are tours that will take you here but it isn’t necessary to be on a tour. Entry to most areas is free and there are plenty of signs to help find your way around."
A nature and picnic park,"The day was cold, cloudy and miserable so our time here could have been much better. This is basically a nature zoo with a selection of exhibits to view, rides and activities for kids/teens and picnic areas mixed in with walks, gardens and small shops. A better day would have made us stay longer, but 2 hours was enough for me. The autumn colours were beautiful and the area well kept, clean and easy to navigate. Sunny weather would definitely provide a more positive adventure."
Healing park for Seoul citizens together with visitors as well.,Promenaders would like trot around the park. They also can visit small park of deers. Han river side walking trail is very nice to enjoy scenic river view.
Relaxing and fun,"Step away from the city for some peace and quiet. Rent a bike or tricycle. Check out the deer and ecopark. Walk, sit, play, relax. Enjoy. "
So Good So Green,"It is a chance to see the natural side of Seoul but there can be mosquitoes so take your cream/spray with you. You can feed deers and have a picnic. Also there is really beautiful disabled-friendly children's park, insect museum etc."
Excellent atmosphere!!!,Had a blast with my wife and two daughters. Spend two 2.5 hours there. A wonderful relaxing environment!
One of the best parks in Seoul,"So serene and beautiful. Lots of things for children. Check out the splash pad, the deer park, bike rentals and the playgrounds! There's a million things to do here. Great date activity and great day with the kiddos."
Peaceful,So beautiful and peaceful. Great for anyone. Nice. Great walk. I think it is an amazing experience!!!!!!!! Just great!
A little peace in a bustling city,Great place to go with kids. There are deer to observe and a nice playground. Very easy to reach and quiet. 
Natural Oasis within a busy city,"Seoul park is the perfect getaway from the busy city of Seoul. The park has everything one needs for a perfect getaway. Great for picnic, meditation, naps, biking, strolling, and even deer watching."
Beautiful walk,"Seoul forest is such a wonderful place. Lots to see and do. I couldn't quite believe the walk-in butterfly house was free entry as it is well maintained and a wonderful experience. Butterflies are free to fly around you so not for those afraid of bugs (some butterflies are quite big and there are a few dragonflies too). There is also a deer feeding area where you can buy deer food from the vending machine which costs 1000 won. Seoul forest is quite a large area so if you want to explore it all, get those walking shoes on! Definitely worth a visit and is a cheap day out."
Good for the afternoon ,Went with the kids for the afternoon. Was able to rent a bicycle with only a driver's licence. There are enough activities to keep kids occupied for a few hours including feeding deers a park for children and a water playground. 
Beautiful ,A good walkGet out and walk~ the only thing that ruined it for me was the noisy kids otherwise it was a beautiful Forest it's like you left the city of Seoul ~
Excellent way to escape the city,"We visited the 'forest' as Seoul was our third stop on a trip around cities in the Far East and wanted a break from the business of the built-up city areas. The forest is more of a park than a forest but still was well worth visiting. We spent most of an afternoon here, walking the park and discovering hidden areas (small animal area, deer retreat, children's park, statue park, etc). The cafe overlooking the lake with fountains was peaceful and we happily sat with a drink and ice cream here for over an hour. We found somewhere to rent bikes by the hour (all sizes, and tandems!) for a reasonable price, and although we didn't use the facilities there were tennis and badminton courts. Overall was a great way to get out of the city and also away from touristy areas for an afternoon - would definitely recommend to someone looking for the same, particularly in summer."
Beautiful Park,"Seoul Forest is an amazing place to visit on a sunny day. Plenty of paths to walk, flowers in bloom and seats to sit on under the trees. The Butterfly Garden and Insect House are great, even for those without children. The Deer Corral is also good, with a vending machine out the front where you can buy food to feed them for only 1000 won. "
"If my child is happy, I'm happy.","This is the second time I came. I rented the two-seater pedal cart from two different shop. The one with the heart-shape plate is cheaper with hourly rental of 12,000 KRW but requires passport deposit in 2013, The other shop's rental for one hour is 16,000 KRW with no ID deposit but they gave my child a water guy toy after I returned the cart. We always pedal to the deer park to feed the deers who will basically licked the feed off your palm. Just be careful as there's a gentle slope on the final stretch near the deer park as it's quite crowded. Remember the brake when going down the slope.There's an eco playground, sand playground, lots of nice modern statues in the park. Both parents and children will enjoy the park."
place for relaxation,"Away from most traffic noise, Seoul Forest is a fantastic way to spend a couple of hours to stroll around and be with nature. I was there in April and the paths were lined with rows and rows of cherry blossom trees. The crowd was manageable when I visited on a Saturday. A lot of people were riding bikes and feeding the deer. There is a small corner for bunnies and a butterfly enclosure too. I think it will be great to visit during the autumn as well."
Spring Time at Seoul Forest,"If you want to avoid the crowd in Yeouido Island, Seoul Forest is the best place to go. You can peacefully walk around and take pictures without getting photobombed.I think the best place to visit Seoul Forest is during spring time."
"Beautiful place, not crowded","This is probably one of my favourite areas in Seoul. I hope it’s not going to be inundated with people the next time I visit. The place is huge and it takes a long time to really cover all of it. Unfortunately, by the time we arrived almost all of the cherry blossoms were gone :( But we still managed to take photos of really nice flowers and just the general scenery which is beautiful. It was pretty chilly when we were there but it was a comfortable walk around the park. A lovely place to gather with friends and have picnics. Will be back here again next time!"
"Got there before the cherry blossoms, but I saw deer and bunnies!","I went when it was still a bit too early for the cherry blossom season. But this is a really spacious park! You can rent a bike from bikeseoul.com, with 1,000won for an hour of cycling (I think), and I recommend you sort it out before reaching Seoul Forest Station. Directly in front of the exit is a row of green and white bikes which you can rent. You do not need to be a citizen of Korea to use the system, and all of them have baskets and gears. I thoroughly enjoyed stretching my legs, feeding the deer, and watching the bunnies. I did not have time to explore the entirety of the park, so I recommend at least 3 hours if you are the adventurous sort."
Gorgeous sakura at Seoul Forest - can spend more than half a day here,"Seoul Forest is a lovely getaway from the hustle of Seoul. Note that there is some construction activity near the subway so you might need to walk for a bit before you head to the entrance. Same goes when you are exiting too. There's an information centre from where we picked a map. Headed towards the deer park but got distracted by the lovely sakura and the insect house enroute. There's a deer food machine just a wee bit away from the deer park. The deer looked much bigger than expected and be wary of the aggressive ones which are all too happy to grab the paper cup from your hands whilst you are feeding them. There are different parks within Seoul Forest so we then headed towards the open area where people were sitting on picnic mats and enjoying themselves. There's eateries at a mall near the skating park at Gate 3 so if you haven't bought anything to eat with you, you can head there. There's also a eating joint (but unfortunately all in Korean) near the waterside area. We spent a lovely half day here. Highly recommended."
Nice place with small children,"It's a nice park with playground, a place to see and feed the deer.we bought Gimbak before going to Seoul forest, and have our lunch there.didnt see eateries around. good to bring food or snack if bring small children (esp after they finish playing at playground).playground to deer is about 20 mins slow walk."
Very nice place to bring the kids to spend 1 whole day,"We recently went to Seoul Forest when we were in Seoul for a vacation last Dec. And we did not regret the decision at all.The journey there is pretty straightforward.. There is a station ""Seoul Forest"" on the Bandung line.. from the station, just follow the signs to the park..NOTE : when we were there last Dec, there was a major construction going on in the front of the park..The park is very big and it is free to enter.. the only cost needed is the deer feed for the lovely deers... i think it is about W100 per cup of feed...Make sure you have enough time for the nice scenery, playground and to visit the deers.. the deers are at the far end of the park from the Train Station.. so factor in the timing needed to walk there...There is also a playground in the park where my son had great fun.. All in, this is a very nice place to relax and see some lovely deers..NOTE 2: there was a van @ the entrance selling Churros made fresh and fried on the spot... if you see the van, buy some and enjoy.. very nice and cheap...."
Nice area to chill in Seoul,"I would recommend to visit Seoul Forest if you want to take a break from busy city life. It is quieter compared to Hangang park, and more suitable for a picnic under the trees. It is best to visit during Spring and Autumn. You can take a bus and subway from Apgujeong area, easy to get to as well. "
Escape the City,"Fantastic family spot for days with pretty weather. There is a small skate park, many cycling lanes (bring your own or rent a bike or buggy), in the summer, little kids can play in the water feature and there is a chaging room. There are some animals down on the far end and a couple of different playgrounds. No entrance fee makes it even more an amazing deal. Bring the kids and a small sun tent and relax for the whole day. Bring a picnic or have something delivered right to your picnic spot!"
Beautiful park in the middle of Seoul,"This place is amazing. It doesn't feel like you are in the middle of a thumping big city. A green space with artwork, grassy banks, trees and flowers, paths to walk and ride on, a deer park, bridges, fountains and a lake. This is a lovely destination for a picnic on a sunny day and easily accessible by public transport."
Fabulous Break from the Action,"It is easy to get caught up in the excitement of Seoul, but Seoul Forest offers a wonderful break in the action and a chance to breath, relax and soak up some natural beauty. This is an extensive park that includes lovely walks, natural surroundings, educational exhibits such as a butterfly garden (particularly fun during a winter visit) and deer park where you can feed the deer. Restrooms and snack bars abound. Easy to get to on the metro, too. For our family, Seoul Forest was a bit of a hidden gem that we found only because the palaces were closed for New Years and we wanted something to do...but you can seek it out as a destination. I know we will the next time we visit Seoul."
Great place for a stroll,"We went on a Monday so it was very quiet, not many people around. I enjoyed feeding the deer the food I purchased for 1000won from the vending machine"
Wonderful autumn scenery!,"It's a great park! Many surprises within! Away from the hustle & bustle of the city. Initially, I thought 1.5-2 hours should well be enough, but I spent around 3h inside! The park is full of autumn colors! The disappointing part is the Hangang River, as it's filled with the traffic noise. It's free admission, and you can get a free map from the Information counter near the entrance. It's a good free attraction!"
A great place to relax,Seoul Forest is a great place to relax. You can have a picnic and enjoy nature while still being in Seoul. 
Nature & more nature,"Seoul Forest is easy to get to by metro. There are a total of 5 parks & 16 exits/entrance. You can get the guide map at the exit/entrance. We were at Seoul Forest around 12.30 pm at the end Oct and therefore could only cover mainly Park 1 & Deer Corral of Park 2. We had our lunch at one of the cafeterias in it.During this autumn season, we took many photos of the awesome autumn colors especially at Forest Path (Park 1). We saw families and students enjoying time together at the family yard, Sculpture Park and Mirror Lake too (Park 1). We are nature lovers, so naturally we enjoyed our leisure walk appreciating the fresh air, clean and peaceful environment in Seoul Forest. We will visit again on our next trip to Seoul."
Do not expect a forest....it's a park.,So happy when my friend said he bring to Seoul Forest. After only 30min driving and still being in town : he said we arrived ! Huh !Yes yes Seoul forest is simply a big park in town. So do not think being in the middle of a forest...just in the middle of the city.However....I have to admit this is a beautiful park. Long path to walk or jog. Places to seat or pic-nic.Perfect place for fresh temperature in summer.
Had a pinic at Seoul Forest,My friend suggested we went to a no-so-touristy spot in Seoul and early in the morning we started our trip to Seoul Forest by metro and we were there for a few hours walking around and taking photos. There is a deer park in Seoul Forest.
A good place to be,"Butterfly garden was wonderful. Overall, the forest/park is great for a walk, bicycle ride or a lazy lunch/brunch. Great atmosphere."
A great place for a stroll,This is a pretty good sized park which is great for families to take their children to. During the summer kids can get wet in the fountains as they shoot up and come down at various moments. Take them to the large playground with two long slides that they would love. You can find a lot of bike paths for couples and parents to ride along or you can play catch on of the two big areas of grass (one path is even lined with apple trees!).There are plenty of places to relax and many people even bring their tents. If you get bored you can see some unique modern art on the grass or check out the fish and waterfowl in the lake as well. The only downside is that it's a very popular place and it gets very crowded on weekends.
Take a break!,"It's a lovely park either to walk or to cycle. It's less crowded on week days. If cycling, you can get there via the cycling path along the Han River and through an underpass (it's indicated although a bit hidden). There are several attractions: the deer enclosure is probably the most popular among visitors. But there's also an insectarium and a butterfly conservatory, as well as a convenience store, tennis courts, playgrounds and lots of green areas for picnicking. The forest is public and admission is free."
A nice park to play in but don't go on Mondays,This is a lovely park to walk around in. The playgrounds are fun. There is a little stream to walk in to cool off. The only thing is we went on a Monday and a lot of the attractions were closed like feeding the deer and the butterflies.
Cherry Blossoom,Visited the park few times but the best time to visit (based on my expirience) is during the famous cherry blossom....it was sooo nice there. But the park is really nice to visit all year long :)
Get close to the nature!,We cycled here via Hangang. The place is so pretty with cherry blossom petals falling from their trees. Sadly the ecological forest is only open in summer and winter so we didn't get to see the deers. Great place for strolling and cycling. There is also an inline skating rink.
Haven,It was awesome! Great place to cool off in the fountains and walk in the shaded areas... The butterflies were magnificent!!! In love with the forest!!
Nice for a Stroll,I would say this is an average park. It is nice for a stroll. There are bunnies & deer in a caged area to feed. Feed is available from a vending machine for a fee. A nice size pond is on site for beautiful views. There are a few different playgrounds if you have children. There is also a butterfly garden on site. Over all I would say this is a nice place for a picnic and to just get out of the house/hotel. a great place to let the kids run and play.Visited April 2014
Beautiful,"I've been to the Seoul forest plenty of times. During the different seasons too. Because I come from a tropical climate, the seasonal changes are intriguing to me. The forest is easy to get to, (Seoul forest station) and it is HUGEEEE. There are multiple walking paths you can choose from and there are signs along the way. I usually just walk to the deer enclosure. And then I turn back it's a short route. But plenty of nice views for the eyes. There isn't much food around. Heck I don't recall seeing any. So be sure to get some snacks and water from the convenient store at the train station before heading into the forest. Also the forest is actually a FOREST. It's near the road so you can hear cars passing by. And there are concrete walking paths and a lot of bathrooms."
Big park,"We found it to be rather average. It was nice, but nothing out of the ordinary. If you are nearby, it's a nice park to go relax and walk around. However, we found nothing special to warrant the travel time to get to it if you're a bit further away."
Fun and Relaxing Park,"It's pretty small, but there's lots of little things to do, like a splash zone and outside exercise machines. This would be a great place for a family with young kids because there's an awesome park (see attached photo for one part of it). It's also just a nice place to go if you want a relaxing place for a picnic. There's low-to-the-ground wooden tables that are great to sit on and stop for a bite.Overall, a very well-designed, small park if you want to relax for a few hours during your vacation."
Highly overrated ,"Yes it's has nature and would be a good visit during spring and autumn. But let's face it: highly overrated. Good for a simple sit out but nothing that special or not even lots of nature around, unlike even central park in new York. "
Not bad,It was not like a forest. Just a park. But you can rent bicycles and ride along the river banks of Hangang River.
Escape the summer heat,"We dscovered Seoul Forest about 6 years ago when our children were quite young and it has remained a firm summer favourite. There is plenty to keep kids busy for a few hours from climbing frames and slides, feeding of the deer, followed by a cool off in the play fountains (don't forget your bathers). Now that our kids are getting bigger, we take bikes and cycle from the park to the river. There are toilets and fast food. The car park can get full quickly so be prepared to queue."
For nature lovers..,"We went here in November so the surroundings are orange-gi. A perfect place to rest and avoid the city noise. It's kinda big and you need hours..... We had a lot of pictures here. I love nature, so I really enjoyed a lot. I want to visit the forest again in Spring and see the beauty of ""green"" Seoul Forest. There is a little flower garden which the flowers are in full bloom of yellow and purple.A perfect place to relax and have a walk with your friends, family or with your someone special. One of the places that I would really love to visit again."
A great place to relax in the middle of Seoul. Avoid in winter. ,"This place is my favorite place to relax in Seoul. With a big patch of green you can lie down on the grass and chill out kids play on bikes and families have fun. It's also large enough that it's not often overcrowded. The other attractions aren't all that like the butterfly garden. Don't come for that. Bring a ball or badminton rackets, your favorite book and chill out here. "
Perfect Stroll,"I visited the forest, which is really more of a park, with my girlfriend on an overcast, autumn/fall afternoon. We had a walk around in the cool weather and loved it. The colours were amazing. The forest also has an insect house, filled with butterflies, other exotic insects, some peculiar-looking fish, as well as a few large tortoises. Overall, despite the oft-termed 'miserable' weather, we really enjoyed it for the purpose it served: a peaceful, quiet experience. They forest also has deer which you are allowed to feed with park-sanctioned food from a dispenser."
excellent choice for a family picnic,"the place I like best is the playground where the very long slide is installed. Many kids line up to go down the slide and it's really fun and exciting. After you have fun at this playground with your kids, you go to the wide lawn for eating your lunchbox. And then you look around the forest. If you want to participate in activity performed in the park, you can book it via seoul forest website in advance. It's going to be fun and a good memory for your kids."
Nice park in the middle of the City,"Seoul Forest is a nice park in the center of Seoul, with a nice environment. The park is big enough to make you forget that you're in the city. Nice playground for kids. However, although clean overall, it wasn't as maintained as other parks I visited. Also lacked cafes, restaurants shops or other ""great"" attractions to make this a ""must-go"" destination. I'd recommend visiting Seoul Dream Forest instead."
Unfortunately Disappointed,I had a free morning before meetings and decided to check out Seoul Forest. It recevied great reviews and seemed promising. It was a let down. Perhaps it wasn't the right time of year (I visited in mid-October). It didn't seem that well taken care of. There were some flower beds still in bloom. I didn't think it was particularly that big after being told it would take a 1/2 day to do. Perhaps if you do all the extra stuff such as the butterfly garden and children's activities. I went early in the morning before10am so none of the buildings were open yet.It is easy to find. Take the B (orange line) to the Seoul Forest stop. Follow the signs in the metro for the Seoul Forest exit (Exit 3). When you come up from the metro just walk straight a block and you'll see a giant white sign for Seoul Forest.If you have free time and want to wonder around a bit outdoors it's not a bad place however don't expect to escape the hustle and bustle noises of Seoul. The park is surronded by busy roadways so you'll still hear traffic all throughout the park. Maybe wear your headphones with some nature sounds to really try to escape.Hope the summer time would be a better experience.
Excellent for kids,"This would be an excellent place for kids to hang out. Playgrounds and ecoforest where they get to feed the deers. Excellent weather for visit in autumn. Free entrance and children can easily spend half a day without getting bored.The train station ""Seoul Forest"", on the Bundang line, is the nearest station to this place. Once out of the station, turn right and walk ahead. For some reason, this is not showing on Google map. This 5 min walk away from Seoul Forest, compared to the recommended Ttukseom station, which is a 15 min walk away."
"Easy to reach, a nice leisure park with wetland in the center of a capital","Location: easily reach by bus or underground. (center part of Seoul, beside the Han River)Good Complex: with children facilities, jogging paths, wetland, animals and biking paths beside the Han River. There are also some cafe and convenient store in the park."
Good place to relax,"Seoul forest is like an oasis in the city. It is a nice place to walk around and relax, but nothing much to do around there.If you are with your date or family, that is a nice place, but not for casual tourism.They have some playgrounds as well."
Amazing forest in the middle of the city,"This place is really peaceful especially on weekdays because not to many people come here on weekdays so this place is not really crowded. Also, you can have a picnic which suitable not only for a couple but also family or friends. Don't worry about the space to have a picnic because this place is quite big so you can choose where to have picnic either.If you like to take photos, then you come to the right place because the scenery here is really amazing. Come in wrong season? Don't worry... There are still a lot of spots with great views that are not related with the season, such as the stream, pond, etc. So, take a visit to this place will be a right decision if you want to have a picnic or just have a city escape with your partners."
Something for everyone in the family,"We spent a full day at the Seoul forest. There is so much to do for children from play area to cycling to feeding the deer, rabbit,Guinea pigs, fishes. Spread across a huge area so be prepared for lots of walking. Not many food options so bring your picnic basket. Sculpture park is interesting and the huge playground is lovely to laze. "
lush greens and blooms in the city,"The Seoul Forest is easy to go to - I took the line 2 train, went down at Wangsimni station and changed to the Bundang line. The Seoul Forest station was 1 station away.It's a very good place for walking and spring blooms-hunting. When I came mid-April, most of the cherry blossoms already fell off the ground but there were other nice spring blooms in the forest."
Fun Natural Area of the City.,"We came to the forest and rented some bikes for the afternoon. It was fun to bike around and see the forest, lake and statues. It is quite far from the city center, we took the subway there then a taxi. There are playgrounds for children and it is surprising change from the rest of the loud, crowded city. There are lots of areas for picnics or just quietly relaxing."
Great place to spend a day,"I am so glad I found out about Seoul Forest. It's a big place with lots of things to do even in winter. There are 5 different parks. There is an enclosure for deers and they will come to the edge of the fence to eat from your hand. (There is a machine near the enclosure where food for the deer can be purchased.) There is a place where they displayed insects, an echo forest and most important lots of place for the children to run and enjoy the fresh air. As we were there in winter some of their attraction was not open like the splash fountain but my children still had lots of fun building snowman, sledding and having snowball fights. Coming from a tropical urban city, this was definitely one of the highlights of the trip. The great thing is it is really convenient to get there. Take the subway to Ttukseom station (line 2). Exit via exit 8 and walk about 15 minutes. There are even directions in English. Another great thing - it's free!"
Seoul Forest is worth the trip!!,"I am amazed that i am the first one to comment on this hidden jewel, yeah maybe its a little far from seoul but it was a perfect place to get away. Ride the yellow line train and its clearly marked to get to the Seoul Forest. The landscaping is really good and there are many things to see and do inside the forest. You can rent a bike, there is a butterfly area where you can actually go inside and the live butterflies are fluttering all around.. its free?? Great place to take pictures, if you are into flowers then you should go during the spring and summer but i prefer the fall when the mosquitoes are under control. There are clear maps to see and there are certain sections of the park labled so you can choose your interest. There is a place that you can buy food to feed the deer.. great chance for kids to see and feed the deer and they are always hungry. There is a bridge section that allows you to walk from the park all the way to the Han River. Its a great place to grab an ice cream and walk around with friends or families. Plan on spending some time just to go to every part of the park and you can even continue on and walk around the Han River. Good place to picnic and take pictures. The best part is... its free??? Enjoy"
