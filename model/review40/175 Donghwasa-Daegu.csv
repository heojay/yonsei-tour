Historic temple ,"Donghwa temple is located the Palgong mountain. It's a class & historic temple in Daegu. If you visit in autumn, you can watch the fabulous view with changed colors leaves."
Train ,"This is a city stop for the KTX train, a large city that perhaps it is good to give a stop over and explore around "
Such a nice view! ,"Ive been there with my family.It was the first time visit there and many forigners there too. It’s pleaceful temple in Daegu. You can stroll there for a while. And can see the big buddha statue.If you visit there first, you can get some discount when you take a Palgong Mountain cable car. "
Beautiful grounds with giant Buddha statue.,"Visited Donghwasa while staying in Daegu. The grounds are located about 30 minutes (19 stops) from the Donghdaegu station via the red 1 bus, which is located in a bus stop on the street behind the station (can be tricky to find as it's not in the station itself). Once you get to the grounds, it is a bit of a hike uphill to the temples but well worth it. There are a few different temples but also make sure you get to the giant Buddha statue which is a 10 minute walk in the opposite direction from the main temples. That is worth the visit by itself. I highly recommend a visit to this place."
The usual Temple styles with the Largest Budda to see.,There are many temples and the Largest Medicinal Budda in the world.Very large area to walk around.Close to Palgongsan Cable Car.
Quiet and peaceful,Entrance is 2500won per pax. It is about 20-30m walk up but the surroundings made it worthwhile. Note that you can skip the stairs but walking further to take the car route
Peaceful and serene,"Temple is not big but there's a big Buddha nearby, quite a distance to reach as it is in the mountains. "
Probably better on a dry day!,"It started to tip it down with rain as I got to Donghawasa and I suspect I'd have spent longer there if it had been dry! However it's a beautiful temple and the enormous statue is very impressive. I especially liked the lovely paintings on the sides of each building. The museum (in the large prayer hall by the statue) was a bit small with nothing in English and the second floor seemed to be closed. I got there on a #1 express bus (the red one) after a trip to Gatbawi (get off the #401 at Migok-dong, cross the road, wait for the next #1). The bus dropped me at its last stop in the little settlement near the cable car and I was planning to walk back from there to the temple after lunch. However currently the top gate is closed and you have to go in via the Donghwagyo Bridge gate. There is a bus stop here too and then it's about 500m up the road past a ticket office (2,000 won ticket fee) to a free shuttle which will drive you the rest of the way up the hill. "
Rainy day and Monday visit,"We visited the temple on a misty Monday. The mist and fog added to the mystery and beauty of this place. It also made it virtually deserted. Being a Monday, several parts of the temple were closed. The museum, the temple food area, and most food stands were closed. Honestly, it did not hurt our experience. This was one of my favorite places to visit on your trip to Korea. "
"Scenic, lots of hills","Beautiful views, ample parking, and a lot to see. My children are 10&13 and enjoyed seeing a traditional temple. We visited, same time, last year. Toilet facilities are out houses or ""squatty potties"". Bring soap, bathrooms were not equipped:( "
My fav temple,"We visited a couple of temples and my daughter (who lived in Daegu for a year) visited a number of temples. This was a definite favorite. If you only have time to tour one temple, go to Donghwasa."
Picturesque and serene!,We visited several temples during our visit to Daegu however this was the largest and relaxing for two adults and a toddler. 
nice zen temple,I have visited many temples in Korea but I thought donghwasa was really good. it's slightly far away from the city centre but was worth the visit. would love to try the temple stay next time!
Beautiful,"Rare to find ancient buildings in Daegu that survived the various wars. Donghwasa is a fabulous area of living temples ( some ancient, some reconstructed) and a giant Buddha all set on the edge of the mountains but within easy reach of Daegu on the city tour bus. Definitely worth the time. Would be good to have a guide and discover more, but even without much information it was a joy to behold and relish the tranquility. Maybe best to go on a weekday, as we did, and avoid crowds."
Great Day Trip,"If you're looking for a nice little day trip to get out of congested Daegu then this spot definitely will scratch your itch! Very beautiful mountain scenery and lots of food and drink options just outside the gate. The giant Buddha is breathtaking and the mountain air is very refreshing, you won't regret coming up for the day. For those thinking of staying the night there is a Temple Stay option.Now, you're probably saying ""This sounds great but I don't have a car and a taxi will cost way too much!"" Well, you are in Korea which means great public transportation! Just take the #1 Express Bus (Red) outside the Novotel downtown and you can relax while someone else does the driving and you only pay like US$2 to get to one of the best scenic spots in the area! So, what are you waiting for?! Get your butt on the bus and go see Korea!"
The biggest and most beautiful Buddhist temple near Daegu.,"The temple itself is quite stunning, with interesting architecture and a peaceful atmosphere you'd find at any other temple. But Donghwa Temple also has a small-ish museum of Buddhist history and culture which I like, along with a ""Big Buddha"" statue. If you come in the Spring, try and get there for Buddha's Birthday (a national holiday) and you'll even get to eat some vegetarian bibimbap. The whole are around the temple has plenty of other opportunities for hiking, taking pictures, and just enjoying the fresh air. A definite ""must visit"" for Daegu."
Beautiful place,We visited here in October with my parents and 6 year old son. It was a lovely place to visit. The Buddha itself was worth the visit. We ended up being shown around by a monk who was very generous with his time and his English was excellent. A very calm and peaceful place to visit away from the business of Deagu.
Giant Buddha and chanting prays,Beautiful place. Giant Buddha is a sight to behold and the calming chants of monks rhythmic prays is unmissable. I feel very honoured to have witnessed it. Can't wait to show this off to friends and family.
Great temple to visit in Daegu,"We took a taxi to this location and took the red bus back to Daegu. Ask the bus driver with a printscreen in Koran, where to stop. We stopped to early, but had a tremendous adventure of finding our way back by train to Daegu city centre.You will spend at least 2 hours overhere. There should be a to the mountain with a great view, but we did not have enough time to do that.My girlfriend, who is a buddhist, loves these kind of temples. The large Buddha statue and large drum are for sure worthwhile to see."
Nice Temple with a Giant Buddha Statue,"Many of the temples we have viewed in South Korea have been very similar in design so I try to look for things that set them apart from the others. This one had a few features we really liked. For starters the gate you drive through to get to the parking lot is huge with 4 large guardians posted. The temple itself has dragons lining all of the staircases and there are a few large stone lanterns.  The real highlight is the giant Buddha statue. You have to go through the small gate house, down some stairs and over a bridge to get to it. Follow the path and climb the temple stairs and you will arrive in a courtyard full of stone pagodas, statues, and the Buddha. "
Big temple compound and expanding,"Bus 401 takes you from most locations within Daegu to this place, and the bus even stops at Gatbawi. The temple itself is worth visiting, it occupies a huge area, and the standing Buddha statue itself is a short distance away from the main temple"
Beautiful ,It was gorgeous. Not a great place for strollers. Peaceful and pretty. We would like to go again when it's not so horribly hot.
A nice temple especially after the hike down from Palgonsan,"If you go up Palgonsan (one of the two mountains in Daegu) by either hiking or cable car, you can end up in this temple if you take the main road while going down. It is a nice peaceful and quite big temple, though it is not the most beautiful one in Korea."
So Beautiful ,Buddhist temple talked away in the mountains ofDaegu ^^. if you're looking to go outside the city and get out this is a great place to explore get in nature there's a beautiful stream there's a Giant Buddha temple that is almost 20 meters tall and it's not really crowded so you can get good pictures highly recommended go when it's cooler like in spring time or in full so it's not as hot. 
gorgeous in spring,Beautiful temple in the Palgong mountain area. Go in the spring for cherry blossom or lanterns around Buddha's birthday. Just stunning for a local Daegu area temple.
Beautiful,Lots of hills. Good for the buns. Really scenic. It was packed on Sunday morning. The structures are amazing. Wanting to go back at night during cherry blossom season.
Serene and calm,I had been there to this place twice and I must say I was mesmerized with the kind of peace of mind I had when visiting this place.I wish I could give one more visit to this place in future.One can get a public transport also available to this place which adds to tourists' convenience.
Donghwasa Temple ,"Great place to visit . It's also a Templestay. My husband and I took a taxi from Camp Walker it was also 30,000 Wons one way however you can take the bus (we found out at the temple) very nice employees helps us get a taxi back. Hours are from 9:00 to 1800 bus do run take # 1, 2,3,4 City bus number Express 1,Palagong 1. Once your done you can walk outside the Temple to Palagong Cable Car... There is a fee we couldn't ride do to the snow. You can see the view of Donghwa Temple it's 700 above sea level."
Amazing New Year's Eve Temple stay ,"Amazing way to experience the local culture! I was lucky to be in the group with many locals who could speak English and we're kind enough to translate, and make sure I was included and engaged in every activity; even the ones who could not speak English made an effort to guide me (I was the only foreigner in the group). Staff was super friendly and helpful. Hensu Suinim (Monk Hensu) who is in charge of the Temple Stay experience had an incredible and genuinely happy aura.Easy access on Public Transportation and there's a nice coffee shop at the entrance of the temple road (La Defense) "
Hiked Mt.Palgongsan then reached Donghwasa Temple.,Very nice and the sculpture and temple is impressive! I recommend to hike Mt.Palgonsan first which is very near the temple an see the beauty of nature.
Fantastic temple ,"The temple experience was great. We went on a cloudy day and still had a fantastic time. But the highlight of the trip was the restaurant at the bottom of the hill. I'm really sorry that I can't remember the name of it but it is at the bottom, a coffee shop at the bottom and the restaurant is on the second level. We ate first and it was a great change of pace from Korean food, it was Italian base food. They have a wonderful brick oven that brings great flavor to the food. Everything was great. We all ordered a plate and ended up putting them in the middle and sharing because they where all so excellent. And after hit the coffee spot on the first floor and didn't think the night could get better........... But it did. The coffee and the cheese cake was out of this world. Go visit "
Nice temple,"This is a large temple complex, has one of the biggest buddha statues in the world here plus a few other areas to explore. Really pretty temples and nice vibe. "
Templestay not for tourist,"We stayed in the templestay program for 1 night. I would not recommend this for foreigners who don't speak korean, there are many talks and activities in korean that no body cares to translate. We felt very left out and even ignored at times... The experience is good anyways, but do not come here with expectations on learning about buddhism. "
A wonderful stay,"We stayed two days and one night and experienced temple life. Painting, meditating and tea ceremony. Staff were brilliant and so welcoming. The accommodation was extremely clean and food bountiful. It's the best we eaten in this trip"
Common Temple ,I have been several Temples in Korea and I think this one is not the best.Statue is big but not biggest.Only it seems that some part of this temple really reserved and very old.If you have free time it is worthy to visit but skipping visiting is not disaster ))
Beautiful!,"I visited this amazing place in mid April. I was amazed by the beauty of the surrounding mountains and beautiful forest. It is not just beautiful but it is a mix of modern and old shrine architecture. I had the opportunity of watching and listening to a monk playing the huge drum behind the main temple. What an Experience!!! If you visit Daegu, do not miss this place!!!!"
Temple with money,If you want to see a really really rich Korean style temple this is the place. The mountains and surrounding of the temple is amazing. Green and refreshing with creeks and gardens. This would probably the temple with most money I guess. Even our ex president Lee myung bak donated generous amount of money(he is well known Christian)You will be overwhelmed by the luxury statues and granite the used to make up this place. Three storage temple buildings are rare and most building are built within 10_20 years.
"Nice, easy accessible temple and a bit of history dig","Take bus N1 straight to the temple from Daegu city centre, it takes around 1 hour, last stop is temple. There are great hiking courses around. Cable car to the top of mount and easy wlks there. Winter can be very windy. Summer is pleasant. Old temple is not huge, but pleasant. Generally there are not many ppl there. New temple with huge Buddha and museum undergrond are a bit out of place there... It destroyed all the impression with it gold and shiny treaures... They have good exposition of history of tripitaka. Museum is free. Temple as well. "
Beautiful temple and large grounds,"This area is covered on the Daegu City Bus Tour as well (www.daegucitytour.com). Beautiful temple and we actually had free vegetarian lunch there, korean style of course. They have really good coffee inside the temple and i absolutely love their latte. The place is pretty chilly even on a hot summer day. The grounds were very quite and peaceful and surprisingly not very tourist filled. Ughhh i know the feeling when you visit a temple in hopes of having some peace and quiet but instead are greeted with massive tour buses and floods of people. There is also a nice exhibition in the temple showcasing the scriptures and stuff like that. There is even a meditation corner for you. Overall an awesome visit."
Peaceful place,Very quite and peaceful place. I loved the nature surrounding very much. They have very nice walk along the area.
Cool Buddha,Even if the buddha is 20 years old it is so cool. Go malke a wish? The grounds are beautiful and there are several temples. Give yourself a couple of hours.
Totally Worth it,This beautiful temple is close to Daegu in a beautiful provincial park. It's a great way to spend a day outside the city. The complex has both the Donghwasa temple and the meditation center. An interesting place to learn a bit about Buddhism.
Donghwasa,A great temple with a really 33 meter tall Buddha! The view of the Buddha was obstructed by lights that they had set up so it was hard to take a clear photo from certain angles. The gift shop is worth a like and the mountainous surroundings are beautiful!
Not to miss,"We spent the better part of the day in the park near the temple and toured Donghwasa after having lunch in a restaurant nearby. Services were going on in the main temple so we didn't go in but sat in the outdoor temple for a bit and enjoyed the peace. The whole area is well maintained and quiet, despite the many tourists. We are definitely glad we stopped here, our last stop of a week in South Korea."
Peaceful and Relaxing,Donghwasa is a lovely temple near Palgongsan and has some great views and excellent nature hikes. Sometimes there are exhibits in some of the buildings. It is possible to do a temple stay here. It is only an hour from DongDaegu Station on bus #1.
Impressive,"Good things: Very cool, a huge buddha status, spectacular view, awesome architecture, long beautiful historyBad things: Might be too cold, but it's ok for me."
Hidden Gem,"The past weekend I visited two temples for Buddha's birthday. One was well known and the other being Donghwasa...one was disappointing and the other was Donghwasa. This is a lovely little temple at the foot of Palgongsan. The temple is easily reached by taking the Express 1 bus, get off at the second to last stop. With two areas that make up this temple there is plenty to see in a very scenic area."
Beautiful visit,"Because B.'s Birthday everything was so nice.The kids liked a lot,and they were very interesting!Billet price:5,000¥ for two adults and parking 2,000¥!Many restaurants down the road!and a good coffee inside the temple area!"
Freezing and beautiful,Definitely a must see in Daegu. Many walks around the mountains and spectacular architecture of temples... and a giant Buddha statue too!
Must visit!,"This was my second visit to Donhwasa and I was fortunate to be able to do more exploring this time. I took the Express Bus 1 from near Dongdaegu station. The bus stop was a bit tricky to find. From the metro exit that says Express bus, go right around the corner as if going to the train station. Rather than enter the station, stay left and take the steps. There is a tourist info stand ahead on the left. Continue past this, go down the steps and before crossing the bridge turn left and the stop is just ahead. It was about a 40 minute ride to the temple which is the second to last stop (1600W). The temple was as impressive the second time and the atmosphere even more so due to the chanting coming from the temple. I thought it was a recording, it may have been, but the temple was full of worshipers, their shoes all sitting outside. When I left the temple, rather than return the way I came, I took the steep steps down to the road. At the bottom (left would have lead back to the entrance), I went right and in about half a mile came across a trail called Dongwasa of Old Trail. I thought I had seen the other end of this trail near the walk from the entrance and took a chance. It paid off. It was a nice hike and lead back to the road close to the entrance. Back at the bus stop area, I followed the signs to the cable car station and went up for more hiking (9000W). At the top of the station was a small restaurant and a large cafe. Several trails could be accessed from here and a map was offered at the cable car station at the bottom. The trail I took was rocky and required proper athletic shoes. There was a group of four musicians performing at the upper station when I returned from the hike. Lots of folks wanted to talk, asking where I was from, where I was hiking to and offering food. Back at the bottom I crossed the street for the return bus stop. There were two Express 1 buses and I did not know which to take but it was easy to get help. The main goal was to get to a stop at a subway station and those were indicated with an icon. This was a great last day in Daegu, but just made me wish I had more time. The concierge at our hotel was not able to help with any questions about the bus and simply and politely told me not to travel by bus. I recommend this mode of transportation. With a bit of research and a spirit of adventure is a great way to connect with the locals and experience Daegu in a more authentic way. As a side note, bus 410 goes to Gatbawi where there is a short paved hike to an amazing Buddha statue. I wanted to return to this area again, but was having too much fun and ran out of time. It was one of the most impressive things I had seen in Korea when we visited years ago."
Free your mind,"I went there on summer, very hot all around the city. But when I reached the enrty of Dongwasa temple, I just felt so nice and cool. There is a water canal and so much big trees which prevents the heat of the sunlight, makes the place very comfortable. They have Temple stay program also. You have to walk some distances and hike up to the temple. There is a big statue of Buddha beside the temple which will certainly ease all your tiredness."
Beautiful hike!,"Do wear your walking shoes, as there is quite a hike up to the temple. You can either hike up the path or climb what looks like hundreds of stairs! The 33 meter (>100 feet) tall Budda is breath-taking with the mountains in the background. Take your time, relax and enjoy the serenity."
Accessible and beautiful,"Donghwasa is right near the end of the rapid 1 line so easily accessbile via public transportation. As with most things in South Korea, it requires walking and climbing steep stairs.You can walk up the steep hill to the lower temples and then further to the Buddha and other sites. Because of the camping and hiking related to Mt Palgong, there are restaurants, a park , and trail heads at this same bus stop. There is a charge as you pass under the archway. If you have a car you can drive up further to first temple complex. The temple architecture is typically colorful and beautiful and you can wander around freely. I understand you can do a tea ceremony as well as arrange a stay. The area around the Buddha statue is relatively spacious and totally scenic. The undergroundmeditation museum is worth a visit but be aware that it closes at 5 and also requires more stairs. Even with the holiday crowds it was still mostly quiet. I have been back twice and keep finding more corners to explore."
More Just a Temple,"On my second trip to Donghwasa I began to wonder up the trail behind the temple, following several of the faithful on their way up the mountain to visit the less populated temples along the trail toward the top. I was quickly joined by a young Buddhist monk who asked if I spoke English. Since it is the only language I'm any good at, we were both in luck. He wanted to practice his English and offered to accompany me up the trail and explain many of the historic sights along the way.It was a wonderful experience, far more so than I had anticipated. At one small temple he asked me to wait outside while he went in and returned with drinks and fruit to refresh us. I learned much about the sacred mountain, the historic sights and his own personal history and why he was so fascinated by Western cultures. While we did not come anywhere close to the mountain top (he was required to climb to the top 3 times each week) I was totally exhausted when we returned to the base, but had learned a great deal and truely enjoyed myself.If you are approached by one of these young monks, do yourself a favor and spend some time with them. It is worthwhile experience."
Place worth seen,"A complex of Buddhist temples located in Daegu mountain area. This place is is spread over a large area which includes old and new temple constructions. I suggest getting an idea of the layout by a guide map (located there) to know the places to see. Otherwise you will easily miss some of the places. You have to walks some distance in this place, which we did. These temples are still active. I visited this place in a weekday evening where it was so claim and quite, where nature and historical monuments/new constructions stand together. To me it a place worth seen."
Full Body and Soul Experience,"I've been to Donghwasa a handful of times since August and every time I find something new and wonderful. In May it was the lateen festival. The area was filled with paper lanterns and displays. I love hiking the trails, visiting the temples and museum, and riding the cable car. Easily accessed by bus (the rapid 1 drops visitors off at the entrance), Donghwasa is a beautiful escape from the city."
Uphill!,"We visited this temple on Buddha's birthday and it really had a festival atmosphere about it that we enjoyed. You could craft a lotus lantern out of Dixie cups and silk petals and there were large lanterns around for viewing. We rode the bus from Daegu and it is a steady uphill climb to reach the temple. If you have your own car, you can park much closer. There were food and drink vendors along the path, but I'm not sure if they are there all the time or only for festival occasions. This was the only temple we visited in Korea where there were beggers. There were several disabled men who had rigged up a skateboard-like contraption to pull themselves along and they also had CD players blasting out chants. "
Beautiful Temple,Donghwasa is a Shilla Dynasty temple with a long history established in 493 AD.Highly recommend seeing this Temple if your in Daegu.
Fantastic,What an amazing temple. The lanterns were a great highlight. Easy to get to by No. 1 Red bus. Small walk up the hill but well worth the visit.
Beautiful and so easy to get to,"As a new resident here in Daegu, thank you Tripadvisors for encouraging this newbie to visit this beautiful place on a recent lazy Sunday afternoon. And thank you for advice about how easy it is to get to Donghwasa. Take exit 3 from the Ayanggyo subway station, jump on the red Express # 1 bus, swipe the bus card, and, voila, 30 minutes later I was walking up a gorgeous, steep pine forest track to a pretty impressive temple. Cheers!!"
Alright. But not for the temple stay experience!,This local temple is famous nationwide and I enjoyed walking around. The night sky views are gorgeous. you'll see numerous stars at night. I participated in their temple stay program for 2 nights 3 days. I personally don't want to recommend to foreginners. One of buddhist priests who engaged in the program to educate participants was a total jerk and needed a lot of moral training to go through for himself. Wasn't worth the money.
Nice temple,"A pretty decent temple, as far as Korean temples go. Located at the bottom of Palgong Mountain, the jewel in Donghwasa's crown is the enormous stone buddha. While parts of the temple complex were first built in the year 493, the big stone buddha that most people come to see was only built in the early 1990s, I believe. For transport, get the redRapid Line 1 bus (급행1) from downtown."
Wish we could have stayed longer,"We were simply enchanted by all the natural beauty of the mountain. There were amazing structures to see and experience: the large Buddha sculpture, the beautiful temple, hundreds of colourful paper lanterns, and of course Monks. I'd love to go back and stay there for a whole day at least. We were on a large tour so we only stayed a couple of hours, which felt very rushed."
"Full of tourists by day, but quite an experience at night","We stayed there for a night in the temple stay program. It's expensive, the food included is mediocre and we got a feeling that it's a bit artificial. For example, the rules seem to be made for tourists, like you have to wash your dishes after eating, although only tourists actually do it; you have to bow when you meet a monk, but monks didn't seem to care too much; you have to keep quiet while eating, but even monks chat all the time in the canteen; smoking is strictly forbidden for guests, but a guy working there smokes in his room, etc. However, at night when the temple closes and tourists leave, you can explore the buildings in silence and are invited to participate in the Buddhist ceremonies and pray with monks, which is quite an experience. You can also take part in the early morning ceremony at 4.30 AM. Almost nobody speaks English, but the monk responsible for Temple stay visitors was quite friendly and really made an effort to talk to us using his smartphone to help translate, which was quite fun:) The biggest con was the high price we paid (almost 3 times more than an average budget hotel), but the Temple stay itself is quite an interesting program and worth trying - though perhaps we expected it to be more off the beaten path and offer better food."
Lots to see and do,"It's a huge complex and you can wander around for quite some time, there is also a cable car not too far and you can combine the experience with a hiking tour. Although I thought Haensa temple was more interesting due to its history this one is definitely worth visiting"
Place of serenity and peace ... and tourists,"This place leaves and authentic and old feeling, although it is not. It is only built very recently compared to many other temples around. This is not a problem though, the site is very nice and you can have a good look at it and enjoy the environment in about 1 hour and half. I presume you will never be alone there, but it is a nice mix of people that visit the site as tourists and those that come there to pray or meditate.I suggest taking the city tour busses: they are convenient, comfortable and quick. They allow you to travel from one site to another with the same 5000 KRW ticket. There might be cheaper options, but this is an easy one. They leave from Dondaegu station at 9h30, 11h30, 14h00 and one later (= too late).If you take the earliest bus, you might just be able to see most the interesting sites of the Mt Palongasan area. Don't miss out on Gatbawi (Stone hat Budha), but you need at least 2 hours for that (see other review)."
One of the best sites in the 'Gu,I've taken visitors to see this a few times. Be mindful of how to take the bus to get there. There are a few reviews where you can find directions. It's in a gorgeous area outside of the city.
Peaceful & Serene,The temple is located on a hill and very easily approachable by the city tour bus. Its an oasis of peace and piousness. One can feel the calm penetrating into soul. Pine trees growing in & around the temple make it all the more charming. You can get on the rope way to reach top of the hill and the view at the top is just splendid. Its a place worth visiting and enjoying the solace in the lap of nature. The ancient temple in Korean architectural style is beautiful. The new buddha statue is also splendid. A small stream flows inside the temple premises which is surrounded by trees which adds ti the charm. One can spend the whole day seeing the natural beauty.I really loved it.
Worth the trip out of the city to see!,"First of all, don't take a taxi! It costs $25 or so from the city. Take the Red bus for $1.70 (1800 won) The temples are amazing! Not to mention the budda. Although it is only 21 years old it was extremely awesome to see next to the old temple. Just so quiet and a step back at everything that is just life. Try the spring water from the mountain, cold and refreshing."
"Temples, Mountains and Buddha",Spend the whole day walking and hiking around and to the temple and enjoy stops by the river. Don't miss one of the largest Buddha Statues in Asia that is said to hold two bones from Buddha himself.
Beautiful and serene,The ancient temples and amazing Buddha were fantastic. It is very easy to get here from Daegu on the #1 bus. I highly recommend visiting this site.
Worth the bus ride!!!,"During my first weekend in Daegu, I was brought here by my best friend, whom I was visiting. The sheer size of the temple, Buddha, and beauty of the compound was breathtaking. I was there in the spring, and on the bus ride to the temple, the street was lined with white flowered trees. I took sooo many pictures while here.One word of advice though- take hand sanitizer and tissues if you can because the restroom facilities outside of the temple grounds are very 'rustic' and tracitional (no Western toilets.) If you are into fitness, there is also a rock wall outside of the compound that looked to be an enjoyable activity."
Biggest Buddah in Korea; large temple site.,"Donghwasa Temple is easily gotten to by taking the RapidBus #2 from the Ayanggyo station (2 stops east of DongDaegu station) to almost the end of the line (next to last stop.. it will say ""Donghwasa"" and is at the top of the hill). First climb the hill to the temple area which is impressive. Then follow the signs down/up another hill (or ask) to visit the large buddah. It is fairly new but is quite impressive as it was put up to hope to reunification of the country."
