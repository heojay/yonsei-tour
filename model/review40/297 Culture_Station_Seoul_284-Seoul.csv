Amazing and thought provoking.,"Beautifully artistic representations of the current shattered country, North and South. The displays and many video rooms downstairs really made me think and understand the situation. I spent a lot more time there than expected. "
DMZ Exhibit,"We saw the old Seoul Station during our walk on Seoullo elevated walkway. It was an older building that was converted into a rotating exhibit venue. There was a permanent section consisting of a couple of rooms that detailed some of the architectural facts about the station as well as its renovation. Some rooms were modernized while others still had the dark wood paneling and thick red drapes harking back to its original status as the main transportation hub.In the other rooms were a number of different exhibits about the DMZ. They ranged from photographs of soldiers, artwork interpretations, books of the DMZ, architecture and local vegetation. I really did not expect to see that many exhibits but it was nicely curated and interesting. Docents were available in each section if you had questions and display signs were in both English and Korean.Overall a very good use of a historical building. "
"Nice building but,,,,","Cool building and layout with the station right there but the homeless folks were a little scary. Long taxi line so we decided to walk and we discovered a place called Maloney's Station right down the street. Cool place with great craft beer, we stayed there till our hotel was ready, checked in, and then went right back to Maloney's station. Good times."
It is also beautifully lifted up at night,This majestic building as character compares to the new train station. Is is also beautifully lifted up at night. You may actually see this if you are on the road or going to Seoul Station or Namdaemun (from Seoul Station). Do visit this place if you have a chance. 
Nice architecture,"Located right beside the new Seoul Station is the old one which has some beautiful architectural features. The station is now an art gallery and is easily accessibly from the new station where there are also a Lotte Mart store and many places to eat and shop. Right in front of the old station embedded in the ground is a huge round bronze plate.My recommendation is not to go out of your way to visit the Culture Station Seoul 284, as it might be a little disappointing but if you happen to be at Seoul Station or if it is a rainy day then spend perhaps 30 minutes visiting here."
The Former Seoul Station. Good exhibition hall.,This is the Former Seoul Station and now it is used as a free exhibition hall.It's good to go inside and take a look half an hour.- The building itself is an attraction with history.- The outside is a wide square. It is often noisy with congregations. And it has homeless people and many pigeons.
Well... in case or rain,"Visiting this old station may have 2 goals: looking at the modern art exhibition inside or get an idea of the building architecture. The first may probably vary as exhibitions are temporary, but while I was there they were… let say it politely: not worth the detour; the second is marginally more interesting, really nothing very interesting. Both have an advantage though: they will protect you in case of rain. If sunny, enjoy the building from outside, this is its best part. Good point, entry is free"
Same one in Japan’s Tokyo station?,"We walked past this on the way back to our hotel and we thought we saw a similar one in Japan’s Tokyo station. Not sure of the significance. There are a lot of homeless men here. This station is no longer used as a train station but is confusingly named as Seoul station, and located beside the active Seoul station. "
Old Station Museum,This is the old Seoul Station turned into a museum. This is a amazing place beacuse architecture from this museum like European style building. You can take the photo with so many spot in this place. 
Busy central station,"The station is the main terminal for KTX and express services to Busan. The AREX airport express trains operate from here and go to both the Gimpo and Incheon International airports. The station is also served by the Gyeongbu line to various places in the country. From the central station, the Seoul Metro serves the station with Lines 1 and 4. Next to Seoul Station is the Lotte mart Discount store and the Galleria department store. The station is a very busy place – and the hundreds of travelers who use it are spoilt for choice with the various places selling snacks."
"From the outside, it has neat potential as a very beautiful structure, but...","We walked by on a Monday when apparently it is closed (there was a guard on duty and we did peer behind him when he opened the door - there appeared to be some art exhibit on the main floor). It is the old Seoul train station, replaced with the modern extremely boring building next door, repurposed as some sort of cultural center. The exterior of this structure is fascinating by comparison to the new stations being in a sort of eclectic style from the 1920s - almost wish we were going to be in town for an extra day just to see if its interior has been restored to the same standard. Certainly worth checking out in a city that is fast turning into just another glass box forest."
Funky art railway station ,Happened to go through the new railway station and arrived at this place. Peeked inside and took a free tour. Different from the usual fare and had some fun with us being digitally imaged on the screens. And there was a wee bit of nudity....... A good hour well spent and learnt a bit about the railway station history.
An Exhibit hall now,"The Cultural Station is next of the Seoul Station. It was an old train station converted to an art exhibition hall. The architecture of the building is interesting and is photo worthy. If you go to the Seoul Station, you can also visit this one. Otherwise, there is no need to just come and see it."
Culture Station Review,This museum has been used as Seoul station once upon a time. Now it has very interesting artwork inside. There are many rooms formed into exhibition centers with very interesting studies. It is worth visiting in Seoul.
Learn about Old Seoul and its rail network,"This is the old Seoul Station turned into a museum. Head out of the main entrance of Seoul Station and take a left.Its a great museum with lots see inside. On entry i received a little ticket likened to the old style tickets that were used in the past. A good touch.Its not just about trains. I saw different art exhibits so there is something for all.The architecture is amazing and i am so glad that they have preserved it. Not many people visit this little gem, put it on your list. :)"
Great art exhibit ,"Really cool historical building right next to the newer Seoul Station. When I went , they had an art exhibit about the movement of time. It was fantastic. There was a variety of types of art and they all had explanations in multiple languages. There were even some interactive parts: kids could make origami sundials and there was one exhibit where you pedal a unicycle to operate the video installation. The upper level is dedicated to the history of the station and is worth a look, too. "
Old Station,Nice old architecture. Right next to the actual Seoul station. Art gallery is like a museum. Good for a small stop
Now another art galery,"If you are around the station then head up to have a look at the outside of the old station. It has been turned into an Art gallery and I have seen enough of these over the last few days so I didn't go inside, but the outside is worth a look as it has been well looked after."
Elegant architecture,"Old Seoul Station is next to new Seoul Station, worth going to take a photo because it is beautiful."
Historical Building,"Just by the exterior, you can tell that this is a historical building. As a child, I remember taking the train at this station to visit the south side of Korea with my family. I haven't been on a train since then but have visited the station to meet up with friends. The inside of the station is clean and has many cafes or restaurants. It is always crowded with people traveling with their luggages so make sure you're not in their way. :/ Last time I was there, my friend traveled all the way from Daejon to visit me for a few hours. We were on a time crunch so instead of leaving the station, we decided to stay there so she can get right back on the train. We looked around and picked a Japanese restaurant since it was less crowded and had a lunch special. Afterwards, we sat at a café to chat until it was time for her train. It was very convenient to hang out in the station and prices seem affordable. I have also taken the subway to the airport from Seoul Station which takes less time than a bus to Incheon. I would definitely recommend traveling from Seoul Station since it's like a central hub. FYI, the smoking area which is located next to the main entrance is very dirty and it stinks. :( While waiting for my friend, I happen to look inside and it was so dirty with the ground covered with cigarrete buds and spit. YUCK! I also saw this guy drinking soju while smoking inside. He seemed quite drunk and talking to himself but I guess it didn't bother the other smokers inside. LOL. If you have to smoke, do it fast and leave!"
Interesting,Again this is a great historical building to go look at located right next to the new downtown train station. You definitely get the feeling that millions of people have walked through there
Nice architecture and great station,"I like the architecture and how central and well connected it is. The station is clean and relatively easy for travellers to find their way. Buses, taxi stands, metro, trains in a clean station. Good station"
Clean and Easy,Seoul train station is really clean and not that huge so anyone can find the train very easily but the elevator is not working sometimes that makes you difficult to carry your bag pack anyway there is easy access to get in and out.
Old Seoul Station,Old train station revamped into a place for exhibitions. I'm glad they kept the exterior look of it. Must be grand in the old days.
"Lovely building, lots of shopping options",Nice European style building with lots of shops and huge Lotte outlets. Great eateries too. This is the main station where you can take a direct train to Incheon airport.
Nice Big Building,It is old subway station. Nice design with grand look.There is lotte mall nearby the station.Also bus stop is just opposite the station
Nice architecture ,Do you know this was the first Subway Station built in Seoul South Korea?? Just a fun fact anyways I like this station its bustling it's busy if you're in for shopping there is lotte duty stores nearby it's convenient you can also walk to City Hall and 남대문 market and gate is ideal it's pretty.
Old building turned into Art Gallery,There was a Van Gogh art exhibition in January. I passed by Seoul Station and found it amazing with people lining up to get in the exhibits.
Typojanchi 2015,"Stumbled on the Typojanchi 2015 at the old Seoul Station building. Very nice art installation showcasing typography, culture and paper."
Impressive station,Very big and modern station. Staff were helpful and it was very easy to navigate around the place once we arrived from busan. 
Great Grand Train Station,"My KTX train arrived on time from Busan. From the moment I left the train, I could feel the momentum of the station. Quickly took us up to the upper level, a modern train station was in front of us. People are moving fast, everyone is busy and signs are clear to show the direction. Stepping out the building, the city is in front of us. Getting down to the taxi station, workers quickly guided us to the next taxi and go."
Cool Building,"So I did not get inside of this place, nor did I know one could. It was just cool to see this building that looks like something one would see in Europe, only in Korea. What I wanted to review was just Seoul Station itself and there was no option for that. What an incredible place! I love getting to the overlook of all the KRW train tracks and all the windows on the second floor. It was fun to see all the shopping there and reportedly it is one of the busiest stations in thee world, only Tokyo is busier. Something like that! The subways system in Seoul is pretty user friendly especially if you have one of the apps that has English on it. I jst had to get off and see this place!"
A modern train station,"It is situated amidst the old town and has a express flyover to reach there .korail speed trains commutes from here. Old structure has been kept with a new ultra modern building with shopping arcade, food courts and lotte outlets for upend market. Further the stationn also has lotte superstore which is huge and good for locals and tourist"
Unexpected,"I was expecting an old train station but when we went in we discovered that's it's the craziest museum in the world. I'm not sure if it's modern art or what but the displays were like..... Balloon rooms, gold toy guns, melted Lego, etc. Super fun. "
The old original railroad station.,"This old building of of the Seoul train station was built in 1920 under the Japanese rule and since long replaced by the newer facilities . During the Korean war it suffered damage but was rebuild. It is a beautiful building and almost feels ""European"". Since 2011 it is like a living museum and is called Culture Station Seoul 284.It hosts cafes, exhibits and performances."
Excellent train station,"This is the heart of rail travel from Seoul. It is very easy to navigate for foreigners. Most signs are in multiple languages. Please give yourself extra time because it can be a very busy location. Multiple subway lines, train lines, shopping center and taxi all converge on the heart of Seoul's transportation system."
Just a passby building...,"If you have been to Europe, and compare this central station with European station this isn't a great one.If you here at the Seoul station you can just exit to have a look at the structure nothing great abt it!more over its so hot! no AC also to make you feel comfortable, everyone uses hand fan! Horrible!!!!"
Train Station,Convenient train station in center of city. The architecture of the old station is very interesting. Trains and buses are all at one location and there are many food options. 
Great train station - easy to get around Korea,"Clean, beautifully laid out train station - very easy for non-Korean speakers to navigate and find trains, etc. We took the KTX train south, and later in the week returned to take the airport express train. All easy and seamless.Lot's of shops in the station and restaurants, including American favorites like McDonald's."
Old and new!,Historic architecture with modern convenience. The station had plenty of shops and restaurants and was located near attractions and centers of business. Just minutes away from several hotels as well.
Not so good,"You can look around the station, but this station has little historic meaning, and the architecture is not so great. I do not want to recommend spend some time around this place, but you will see anyway because it locates in the middle of Seoul"
beautiful sight but sketchy area,"Tourists should note that this was perhaps the sketchiest area we travelled to - there are homeless people laying around all over the area in broad daylight (the only place I saw this in Seoul). If you are in the area and want to grab a quick pic, that's fine but I would not go out of my way to come here."
Old Station with nice architecture,"The old Seoul Station completed in 1925 has been converted into an art space since 2011 called « Culture Seoul Station ». The real attraction of this building is its architecture. On two floors, there exhibitions, events, cultural performances, e.g.The visit is free of chargesNow, the new Seoul Station is a major railway station- The station is served by the Gyeongbu Line, its high-speed counterpart and the Gyeongui Line, with frequent high-speed, express, and local services to various points in South Korea.Around the building, a lot of shops and restaurants."
A piece of Colonial Architecture from the 1920's,The railway station is constantly changing .....but it is basically a piece of architecture from the rather bloody period when Japan bloodily occupied and colonised the Peninsula.A railway Station is a railway station......but look at the history of Korea and be sensitive.
Beautiful and contrasting building,"Seoul Culture Station became a cultural center after the Korean railway changed to an enormous and modern construction next to the old one as it got developed. The old building then calls attention for contrasting with the modern buildings that surrounds it and offers an agenda of exhibitions and performances, usually free."
Nice exposition of youth artists impressions,We got a free ticket to walk through two floors of this station. A group of seemingly students had created a form of art in every room. We got the feeling the Korean's really want to give freedom to creativity in youngsters.
Cool place! ,A real hive of activity! Great place to wander around or just people such. A don't miss place to visit! 
Seoul Train,"Arrived in Incheon Airport, which is a very impressive and modern airport, got to AVIS rent a car and found out I needed a International Drivers Permit to rent a car in Korea. After the calamity of changing everything we planned, we decided to take the train from the airport to Seoul Station. KTX and KORAIL are an amazing way to see the country, and the Subways will take you virtually anywhere you want to go, with cabs there if you need to go directly to a destination. The KTX has a bullet train that travels at over 300 Kilometers per hour and you can travel to Busan in no time. Seoul station is a hub for all transportation within the City, and a great place to start your journey into The Land Of The Morning Calm.Yes - we saw so much"
Beautiful restored and preserved,"I am not sure you will specifically go here, or that it will be on your sightseeing list, however if you are at Seoul Station, and have time you will be delighted to see the old stately structure, beautiful architecture and fancy art work. The subway lines metro line 1, dark blue and the line 4, light blue pass thru Seoul station, so it would be easy to reach and see. When the high speed KTX was started, and the new Seoul Station was built, this old station was turned into a museum and cultural center. Worth a see if you have time. Both old and new station have plenty eating options, and the Lotte Mart, the only real supermarket in downtown. Great place to get stuff for your room."
"nice old building, many beggars","It's a nice spot to be in, mind not the beggars that lives nearby, old buildings surrounded by many modern one. Hub of Seoul."
See the old layout of a train station,We saw the old station while visiting the new one. The old building has been converted to a museum. It's free so have a quick look and see how the station was layout before.
Cooool!!,The old and new station is just side by side at Seoul Station. The building gives a good and nostalgic feel. They can maintain and keep the original colonial building in good condition. Great.
Excellent afternoon out,"We went here on the off chance that it might be interesting and we were rewarded! There was some kind of art festival on - it was late in the day and we'd clearly missed some activities but the exhibitions were very good. The quality was mixed, as was the range of subject matter and media - including an interactive exhibition employing ipods and augmented reality to bring 2D images to life! There was a huge amount on show and we could easily have spent the whole day."
Old and New station,"like in many other metropolitan city, the old building always re new or re build but this station is still keep the original colonial building and just build the new with ""another"" glass architecture ( so many new station in the world using this kind of glass and metal ;P ) so the new building is not so stunning but the old architecture is still look great :) and like in many corner of Seoul in this station also they have Super Mall :p its melting plot for people and culture and so many art event is here but the mall also here inviting all shopaholic around the globe :p"
Just an old building,"We expected the old station to be a hive of activity but on our visit it was deserted although, strangely, unlocked. Yes, the booking hall was interesting in an arty way but without activity it may as well have been a waxworks museum - without the waxworks !"
Former Seoul Station to remember.,It's so easy to reach your destinations in Seoul City and around Seoul by their public transport which is by train. I can say here citizens of Seoul really appreciate by using this connected underground train that across almost many of residences in Seoul nowadays.
Great Building...,The old Seoul Station has been converted into an art space. The exhibit changes from time to time but the real attraction of this building is its architecture. If you are a fan of old buildings or history there is a lot to see here. The building has been completely restored and is open to walk all throughout. There are numerous rooms to see. Two of the rooms are dedicated to the history of the building itself while the rest has become a museum to show off the exhibit at the time. The current exhibit was great although it was all modern art it didn't really fit the space but I still enjoyed my afternoon here. I've also written a more detailed entry on my blog.. Bobby'sAwesomeLife
Former Seoul station became Culture Station,A place you should see in Seoul. Rebuilt old station became Culture Station 284. Changing modern art exhibitions and concerts are on display. All free of charge and very well organized. Check it out on Facebook: seoul284.
Meeting Old friend from DaeGu City,"Someday, He called me suddenly. So i meet him at Seoul Station. I advised him something..and he thanked me..Anyway, that's my recent memory about that place. Frankly Speaking I don't have many memories about that station."
Shop and Go,"The old SS-- a colonial building-- wasn't made to handle a 10million+ metropolis. Fortunately the city decided to add-on and not tear down, so the new Seoul Station is modern architecture designed to complement the old structure and efficiently handle the traffic while the old building is expanded shops. Give yourself an extra hour (or two) before your train."
My Favorite place to go in korea,friendly place and easy to go around...been there alot of times and i will keep on coming back...
Stunning facade and well organised,"Seoul Station is clean, well sign posted and offers a great start to your journey. Lots of takeaway shops, a McDonalds if needed but personally I reccommend ""Paris Crossiant"" - great coffee and awesome pastries....."
This Museum has moved/closed,We tried to find this museum at the Seoul Train Station and were not able to. Someone at an info desk said the museum had moved out of Seoul.
