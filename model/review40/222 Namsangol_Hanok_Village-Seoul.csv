Small and Free,"My visit here occurred on my third time in Seoul and I did not regret missing it on my first two trips. Unlike other recreated villages I have gone to worldwide, this one offers only five traditional houses, which have been moved here. They provide a good cross-section of how Joseon Dynasty citizens lived, but none beckoned to linger; and no hands-on activities, such as wearing traditional garments, were available on an early weekday afternoon in November. Though there is no admission charge, the free access did not seem to stimulate interest, at least at this time of year. I saw only a handful of other visitors during my brief exploration. But this atmosphere proved to be a nice change from the crowds at popular tourist attractions, such as palaces. I enjoyed sitting by the pond here for a while and walking along one of the trails in the park at the rear of the complex.The village is near the Myeongdong area of Seoul. By subway, take Line 3 or 4, get off at Chungmuro Station and take Exit 3 or 4."
Beautiful and Educational,This is a great place to spend the afternoon exploring and seeing the traditional style of living and shops. Really loved it here and It's free and easy to walk around.
Birthday trip,"I loved this tour. The steep inclines and quaint houses and shops is reminiscent of our tour in Tuscany (on much smaller scale). So picturesque, I can understand the attraction for tourists. But I sympathize with the residents having to put up with us taking selfies in their doorways. We only stayed for about 30 minutes. It’s a real look into the history of South Korea."
Very nice,This Hanok village is easy to find and is walking distance from my hotel. The heritage houses are well maintained and is good to visit inspite of being free access
A peek at Joseon culture and traditional houses,I didn't have high expectations as I went to Bukchon Hanok Village before; so reckon it'll be similar ie cafes housed in traditional houses etc. But at Namsangol Hanok Village (NHV) surprises me at every turn. First you can experience 1 hour sleeping time in the hanok (for a small fee). I thought that's a very refreshing experience in true sense of the word. Next you can rent traditional costume and take photos or pretend you're in a period drama and walk around the village. We also came across a gentleman who is a falconer and told us many information on this ancient heritage of korean falconry. The cafe nestled in the middle of the village is also very quaint and the souvenirs are worth looking at.
Excellent ,"We visited yesterday, 20/07/19, a family of 6 aged between 6 - 69. No entrance fee that we noticed. Information hut was on your immediate right after entry. Lovely clean toilets all the way round the area. This trip was throughly enjoyed by all. It was a nice steady walk around the village and gardens. Fun games for the children to take part in as you walk, including a stamp collecting map for the children to find stamps as they walk around. Lovely village and So clean and well taken care of. Some very large Koi fish in the lake which the children enjoyed watching. We could have hired traditional dress at the entrance but with the humid heat we would have struggled. I would happily go again for a lovely peaceful stroll. "
Good,"It’s very close to our hotel. Its a good place to visit, cultural heritage with traditional houses. Fresh atmosphere. It’s free access. Also its not so many people like other tourist attractions, so i like it. "
Great way to experience Korean culture ,"This place is a hidden jewel if you experience some of the traditional Korean culture. The park itself is peaceful and very walkable. One must try “Experience Korea” items at a nominal fee such as making bow and arrows, making crafts, making game pieces, rice cakes, etc. The instructors are people who are experts at these Korean traditions and passionate about sharing them. "
Nice Village,Just take a short walk from Chungmuro station and you will reach this village. Admission is free. We walked around the few traditional houses and the pond nearby. It is small but peaceful and not crowded. A great place for a stroll and photos.
A good look into what Korean life was like,"This is a good place if you want to know what Korean culture is like. They have a replica of a Korean village with the traditional furniture. There were demonstrations of Korean activities, ranging from Korean toys, make Korean rice dumplings and a Korean tightrope walker."
Nothing interested us,"We stayed in Tmark hotel which was just opposite this village and we thought we could just come over to see what it has to offer. But found that the old buildings were converted to teahouse, shop, etc and the place is connected to a big park. Did not explore further as we had time constraint."
Good if you plan on partaking in any activities ,"The village is very pretty but pretty small. We were nearby and decided to take a stroll inside but did not book any of the activities offered (archery making, tea ceremony, costume rentals, etc). We visited on a Friday morning and it was quiet and empty. Ended up sitting by the pond for an hour and enjoying the nice day and atmosphere. "
Great for free attraction,"Hanok cluster, folk game zone, pavilions, ponds, time capsule square, etc.It's a great place to spend 2~3 hours.The location is really good as well. 3 min walk from Metro #3, #4 Chungmuro Station. Near the metro station, there's a bus to N Seoul Tower, too."
recreated village..nice to know traditional culture.,i was taken to this village as a tour package and found it quite interesting place to explore korean traditional culture. it is a recreated village by the government to preserve Korean traditional for the people. nice visit.
Hanok Village,"this is the best place to experience the people staying in hanok those era. after viewing all the hanoks in this village, feels like staying in a hanok for my next trip just for the experience. free entrance too."
Worth a walk to see the exhibits,"After walking Namsan Park, we happened upon a pathway to take us back to our hotel which cut through the Namsangol Hanok Village area. On the day we visited, there was a free exhibition and we took advantage of the opportunity to look at both exterior buildings and the interiors."
Traditional village,"Nice place to visit just near Myeongdong where we stayed.Not much crowd, so you can walk, sit and enjoy the place.Its traditional village, depending on the season there are scheduled events. Check during your visit."
An interesting (and free) Hanok Village and park to visit,"My partner and I had spent a couple of hours around Gwangjiang Market, and decided to walk the 2+ kilometeres back to our hotel on the western edge of Myeongdong. As we are want to do, we like to make the occasional detour if we think a street, or distant object/building might hold some interest. Such was the case as we were returning to our hotel. We came across the entrance to this traditional Village and park, and ended up spending more than an hour wandering around the traditional buildings, and the large park at the rear.We were not able to get into many buildings, and the one building complex that looked interesting happened to be conducting a wedding reception on the day of our visit, which meant we were not permitted to enter anyway. On the day of our visit there were some temporary food stalls operating, and I got the impression from some signage that this park and the architected surrounds/seating etc. at the northern end that the Seoul Food Festival was to be held on this site.We enjoyed our time at this site, and provides the ability to take some really wonderful photos, of the Hanok Village buildings themselves, the large park at the rear, and the higher levels of the park provide some pleasant views of the nearby city areas as well. A relaxing and pleasant place to visit."
Korean history ,Nice historic park for learning about ancient Korean lifestyles and living. Surrounding park has nice trails. Many local weddings take place here. Relaxing place to spend an hour or two.
Great place for pictures ,This village is as beautiful as the buchon. They are different but both will be worth the visit. The plus point is it’s near the subway station. The cafe located within the premise has a nice ambience. I had the ginger citron tea and it was fantastic. 
A beautiful Park,This is a relaxing and great place to visit in the afternoon. It is easy to navigate and very clean. An audio tour is recommended to get the beautiful history and background on this lovely site.
"Recreated Hanok Village, FREE to explore","Namsangol is a sprawling open space, great for kids to run around freely. There's definitely less tourists here, so taking pictures is easy. Unlike Bukchon Hanok Village where you have to mind your voice volume in respect to the residents, few guests get annoyed by noise here. It's a pretty quiet park, because that's how it feels like to me."
Cultural!,It's free to go in. It's huge and beautiful. It's connected to the park where you can also seethe Seoul Tower from afar. They have lots of free programs you can attend - interactive or just to watch and learn. Lots of traditional games you can play. 
Step back in to the past ,A great way to preserve the old buildings and you can also do calligraphy classes here to very picturesque 
Lovely place and many activities for kids,"This place is conveniently located right in the heart of the city and worth visiting. Unlike Bukchon Hanok Village where you could only admire the houses from the outside, here you can actually get inside and walk around the houses. We were there on Sunday and there was a real traditional Korean wedding hosted so we got to observe the beautiful ceremony as well as the venue. Inside, there were few activities for kids to do too. While our daughter got dressed in Hanbok dress (10,000 won for one hour), our son enjoyed making a wooden bow and arrows. There were also craft and tae kwon do show in the afternoon. All in all, it was a very nice place to visit."
Lovely Traditional Place,I found this beautiful traditional village across the street from our guesthouse in Seoul. It has 5 restored Korean traditional houses. The village is not to big but has a beautiful scenery with autumn leaves from the trees. This is as perfect as Bukchon village or Korean Folk Village if you are looking for traditional instagrammable pictures and not crowded too. Entrance is free and also has autumn festival for foreigners. We attended one last Oct 27 of this year. The village also has a path to Namsam park. This village can be found on Chungmuro Station exit 3 or 4 just look for the signages. This place is lovely!
Replacement for korean folk village,"If you don't want to paid for korean folk village and still want to enjoy some Korean history village, then can have a short trip here. Nothing much compare as this is free. Please come on weekend as more activity else it just a <1 hour trip. There is a free guide offering if you interested."
Charming recreation of Korean village,Well done exhibits of typical Korean life from the rural past. Homes have been reconstructed. See the earthenware pots where beans are fermented. Homes and furnishings are on display. Interesting place to walk around for a bit. In the heart of Seoul so access is fairly easy. Lots of other activities on the grounds as well.
Historical,Went here the 2nd time with my family. There's no entrance fee as well and you can pretty roam around the whole area and take good photos. If you're more into learning the history and culture in Korea. You should go here.
Beautiful place,"Namsangol Hanok Village is very close to Chungmuro subway. It was Chuseok when I went and there was a taekwondo exhibition, lots of food and people walking around wearing hanbok."
lovely and quiet,"i went in winter so it was very quiet there were a few people around but not many very close to Chungmuro station but i walked from myeongdong so it wasn't very far at all, there is a Hanbok rental store just outside if you want to dress up bit i was flying solo so i passed on that but he village itself was so pretty and fun to explore, i wondered around a bit and stumbeled on a huge time capsule which was quite cool"
Experience traditional Korean culture,"It is less crowded than Bukchon Hanok Village and the vibe is a bit different. It is also a nice place to try on the hanbok and take photos. If one cannot have time to visit the Korean Folk Village, this Hanok Village can be a substitute as it is in Myeongdong and there are some performances or activities that tourists can enjoy."
Traditional houses ,"Very nice area with traditional Korean houses. The houses are well maintained and decorated. Nice garden yard area, which is very peaceful. Pleasant place to walk and spend a casual afternoon "
Beautiful ,"The scenery is amazing. My favourite part was the pond in the back with swimming fish, where i could sit down and meditate. We even saw a cat running across a bridge. "
Quiet Stroll Through Traditional Houses,"If you like quiet and peaceful strolls whilst enjoying a good view, the NamSanGol Hanok Village is for you. There's not much going on here besides looking at traditional Korean homes (aristocratic) but the walk and sightseeing is quite quaint and serene.But in all honesty, this place can easily be a hit or miss. I went to the Korean Folk Village a few days before I came here so I didn't enjoy this scenery much (even though it's just as beautiful here). So be sure to plan out which village scenes you attend first before going to several. One is usually enough, there's not much difference for two visits. I recommend the Korean Folk Village more."
Architectural,"5 mins walk from Chungmuro subway station (exit 4). Free admission but closed on Tuesday. Namsangol Hanok display Hanok (traditional Korean house) from several wealthy family. Personally I prefer Namsangol Hanok compared to Bukchon Hanok because there are many activities in this place which opens to public, flatter walking path and we can ""peep"" the internal hanok. "
Quaint,"In Korean, this means ""village of traditional houses in the Namsan Valley"". It's in the Pildong neighborhood in Junggu district of Seoul. They try to be authentic to the period, which adds to the charm. We saw many people coming in traditional attire and posing for photos. Very lovely garden to walk around with plenty of benches. "
Good place for photos,Went in mid June close to noon time and it was a bit sunny. Temperature was still a cool 27 deg C so it was ok to walk around. The scenery is nice and is good for taking some photos but otherwise nothing very interesting.
Interesting walk,"If the weather is good, I'll recommend a visit to this place. The architecture is lovely and a lot of the houses have rooms decorated in traditional style, allowing you a peek into Korea's past. It's not a 'walk in and look' - you can stand outside the door and look in, craning your neck around the sometimes dark corners. But there are plenty of signs explaining what you're seeing so you don't have to be well-versed in any history beforehand (although it definitely makes the experience better).We arrived towards the end of the day when everything was being packed up. I imagine it's more lively in the late morning/early afternoon when activities take place, stalls are open outside the main gate, and people walk around in traditional dress. But if you've been slowly walking the area like us, I'd still suggest to drop by. It's a very lovely area with a nice park just next door that makes for a nice stroll. There is also a gift shop which, surprisingly, has some nice and affordable souvenirs. I am not sure if this is an attraction I would've gone out of my way to reach - which we definitely had. But if you have the time, and if you're interested in seeing what Korea looked like before, then do find a nice day and go."
A hidden jewel not mentioned by most tourist attraction lists -,I have been in Seoul several times and never made it to this Traditional Garden and Hanok Village. A local Korean friend of mine discovered it with me on a nice Sunday afternoon. It is only about a ten minute walk from the Catholic Cathedral.
"Nice scenery, otherwise a bit boring","The weather was nice, so it was beautiful to walk around and take some pictures of the nearby garden and small river that runs through. Otherwise a bit boring, but if you pass by anyway have a look."
Peaceful place for a stroll or picnic,The Hanok homes here are lovely but they are only a small part of the appeal of this village. There are some beautiful walking paths and picnic areas in the park around the Hanok. It is a great place for a stroll or picnic. I enjoyed seeing and listening to the babbling stream that winds throughout the village. It is a fabulous place for photos.
Peaceful,"I thought this place was perfect for taking a walk. It was very quiet and peaceful when I was there. The hanoks are fun to see, but there aren't very many of them. It's free, so it's great to check out if you're in the area."
Seoul Trip,"Beautiful place rich of history, better to be with a tour guide to know all the stories behind which will make your visit more enjoyable."
Experience Korean Architecture,"I walked down from N Seoul Tower and took a quick walk through before heading to my next activity. It was a cold day when I visited, but it was still beautiful. I have a hunch that it would be a little more interesting at night with lanterns and lights and Seoul Tower in the distance. I would say that if you are in the area stop by. If you are going to Bukchon Hanok Village, then I'm not sure that there is anything new here. Although there is a lovely photogenic pond, so it's not a waste of time if you want to see both."
A Good Place to learn About Korean Culture,"Namsangol Hanok Village offers few things to the visitor to learn about Korean culture such as Hanbok fitting, archery making, rice cake making or tea ceremony experience by paying a bit of cash. There is no entrance fee if u just want to explore and see. The hanok setting is very nice and you can learn how the traditional Korean house back then. Fortunately if you go in Spring time, u may see a bit of Cherry Blossoms as well as the other pretty flowers. If you go deep down to the center of the park you will find Seoul's Thousand Years Time Capsule which they burried in 1994 to celebrate Seoul's 600th years anniversary which contains cultural properties. It will be open in 2394 in celebration of Seoul's 1000 years anniversary. "
Cool,"Visited as part of a half-day, multi-site tour. It was a quick walk around and we were able to learn a bit about traditional Korean lifestyle and villages. Be sure to duck under the little walkways between buildings because you might hit your head (don't say I didn't warn ya!)"
Beautiful ,Even a grey day could not influence the experience at this place. Two facts helped a lot. Paper lanterns with great figures brightened the impressions there. And there was a foto shooting for an egagement which gave life to this place :-)
A place to get in touch with Korean traditions ,"This village is much better than I expected! I heard from other people it was pretty much traditional houses and nothing too special, but I have to say I really liked it and would visit again. The architecture is impressive and village is quite big. You can really have a feeling of how people used to live in the ancient times in Korea. They also have a nice gift shop with beautiful and original gifts. "
Very nice but small,Very nice place you can see all traditional houses but unfortunately very small town you can finish it less than half hour 
Time Capsule in Namsangol Hanok,The village with traditional houses from different places of South Korea. There is the Time Capsule on the territory of that village. 600 hundred items from modern life are buried there in the ground so that 400 years later (when Seoul celebrates its 1000 years anniversary as the capital city) it could be opened by future generation. Amazing!
Awesome Self-Guided Walking Tour,"Beautiful area to walk around, it's very scenic with the traditional houses and the background of the Seoul industrialized city! Information/tourist booths can be found scattered around with maps and suggested directions to walk around the area. It is hilly, which I personally love, but could be hard on people who have any knee/leg/feet/etc. issues. There are tea shops scattered about and other stores as well. We had tea at a fantastic tea shop along the path!"
Small Village Near Namdaemun,"I walk here from Namdaemun Market. This is such like small village with traditional Hanok Village. If you go to Or before go to Namdaemun, please have a visit at this area to take a photo. It will not take a long time."
Best in Spring!,Enjoyed every side of it since we went there during spring. lots of flowers and cherry blossoms. there are also people and couples in hanbok who are also game to take picture with. good for family bonding too as we see lots of them having a picnic
Traditional Korean House Village ,來南山谷韓屋村逛逛韓國老建築. This is a reserved village for traditional Korean houses. The outlook of the houses are very Chinese house like. But the inside is more Japanese oriented (this is my be due to that Korea was once the colony of Japan). It’s definitely a good spot to visit in Seoul. 
Very cool attraction,"Very cool attraction - also it’s free! The houses are very well preserved, and it’s cool to walk around and see. "
Enjoyed the peaceful garden and traditional houses,"We visited Namsangol Hanok Village on a weekday morning in summer. Beautiful garden with lots of ponds, pavillions and of course the traditional hanok village.A big place to walk around and a good place to learn about Korean Seoul culture. Definitely should visit Seoul Millennium Time Capsule where they buried 600 items in 1994 and to be opened 400 years later. What a romantic idea!We enjoyed walking around the Hanok village where there are different styles of traditional houses.Apparently, there are some ceremony, performances and hands-on activities for the visitors throughout the week. Be sure to check out their website before you visit if you like to experience more. A perfect place to spend a peaceful day in Seoul."
Full of Korean traditional house,"First you don't have to pay to visit this nice place. You can see many Korean traditional home, and there are some performance you can enjoy in the evening. You can even dancing with the performers. There are also some spot where you can try some Korean traditional game here. "
Better than Bukchon if you want to see Hanoks and like touching things!,"My take is this is a better bet for seeing Hanoks because Bukchon is a upperclass residential district set on a hill (people still live there, so you can't just walk in!) In Namsangol, it is a reconstructed village (mostly of old houses that were moved there, and 1 replica), so you can walk around all you like - the other nice part is that it is near Myeongdong (Chungmuro), so easily accessible, and not hilly (unlike Bukchon!)"
Worth a visit,"Went during their taste of korea, that had samples of eats, drinks, and carving demos. Pretty neat experience. Got some goodies to try and take home."
Well worth visiting,This is a great place to visit as historical house have been moved into this lovely park setting.There is a tea house and many places to admire the garden like setting. I loved having the time wandering among the ancient houses.
Must see,This is one place that i would highly recommend when you visit Seoul. Its like traveling back in time. Its very fascinating to see how Koreans lived during those Joseon/Shilla era and how they built the houses with those intricated designs. There's no entrance fee and you can ask for a guided tour as well free of charge. They also provide wheelchairs for seniors who cant walk too long which was really great since im traveling with 2 senior citizens. 
Mid autumn festival,"It was fun and crowded with Korean to celebrate the mid autumn festival. Great experience, there was shows for the whole day, stalls for younger to participate in crafts, Korean families were picnicking, and food trucks selling Korean food. The houses were in good shapes with lots of interior details and we were able to understand how Korean lived before..my boys were learning and asking what were this, why and how. Overall it was great cultural experience to learn."
Underwhelming ,Pretty empty in my opinion. Not much going on. Just drab and unexciting. Not really worth your time checking it out. Free entry. Metro exit 3
Great free tour,"This village is good for seeing historical Korean buildings. It offers free 40 minute tours in a range of languages (Chinese, English, Korean and Japanese). Check before you go what days and times have your language. "
Well preserved traditional houses in the heart of the city,"My friends and I stopped by this place on our way down from Seoul tower. Tranquil surroundings, but without activities or sufficient signboards in languages other than Korean, it is just a location with traditional houses"
Traditional but Underwhelming,"I enjoyed getting to see the traditional architecture at Namsangol Hanok Village (남산골한옥마을). I think this place is most suited for photographers and those with a strong interest in Korean culture. As a tourist, it was a little underwhelming as it is essentially just walking around and looking at the buildings. There is an area where you can watch martial arts or drink tea but it is otherwise a sight-seeing location only. If you are doing the Seoul City Bus Tour, it's worth taking 30 minutes to stop and look at it as it is free admission."
Quaint traditional village,Went on a day tour that included Namsan Hanok Village. Had a nice walk around this quaint traditional village with beautiful architecture. The guide provided interesting narratives.
A hanok village meant for tourists,"We visited here using the subway and exited at Chungmuro station. Entrance was free and it was a beautiful place to visit. We had a nice look around. You can even see the N Seoul Tower from here. Plenty of tourists but the place was interesting nevertheless. Many well-preserved hanoks, pavilions etc."
Korean Folk Village,"Architecture is beautiful, this place is clean and it is free to get in. This recreation of a traditional Korean village has free shows, plenty of refreshment stands, historic recreations and is also the home to many Korean TV shows. There is a group of student offering free tour. They will answer your question about the village."
Nice place,This place is a replica of old traditional Korean villages. The entrance area is like a park and inside there is a ticket counter and a cafeteria. One can buy tickets for hiring traditional Korean dress and having a photo shoot in it for one complete hour. Overall a good place to spend time knowing abt the old Korean era and their lifestyle.
Beautiful quite village in the centre of Seoul,"Beautiful, tranquil area in the midst of all the hectic of downtown Seoul. Gives a good understanding of the traditional Korean lifestyle. Try to find and catch the 1 hour Nap Experience for W2000!"
An awesome Stroll before Night time in Namsan Tower...,"We thought it would be just a simple historical stroll through and head to namsan in the evening and end the night in Myeongdong. Well, the place is beautiful as you take in the gorgeous surrounding , landscape, historical structure and just the vibe on the place. The small details was what interest hubby and i . Beside the pond there are batches of small strawberries growing in the flower beds, and we notice some herbs here and there too.. When you walk around you will see pine cones which the shape is something Ive never seen , some kind of berries (which i wasn't sure can be eaten or not) and just the flowers are beautiful. Take Ur time and breath in the fresh air and somehow the place exudes calmness. I like that there will be a corner for anyone to try some local traditional games. The only setback is would be awesome if there was someone to explain the game to us or maybe they should put some multi-language boards on instructions of games . Lolz.. TIPS: its free to enter, Its a beautiful,place for a picnic soooo many places for some down time.. Theres a Gimbap store directly at the road leading to NamsanGol... Absolutely love their prawn kimbap and kinchi jigae... Yums!! We even take away 2sets of Gimbap for later... Enjoy!!1"
Good place to appreciate ancient Korean lifestyle.,"Bring your camera because you are going back in time. The houses were replicate of old Korean houses. There are some demonstration of Korean craft. Hanbok experience is also available but it's not free. What I like most is the Taekwondo performance at 1pm. There was a booth outside the village which indicates ""free tour for foreigners"". I waited there, but nobody came to give tour, what a pity. I hope there can be more interactive activities in the village. "
Very nice,Walking along the streets and watching the architecture and life gives you better idea of understanding the life of Korean people.
Tradition,"Absolutely amazing place to discover Korean tradition. You do not pay any fee to enjoy this place, but the traditional green tea do not taste nice for many people..."
convenient,"Being situated at Chungmuro station exit 3, this place is very convenient. There are various activities to take part in each day (check out the schedule when you are there) eg archery. There is small cafe inside where you get a discount for the drinks if you are in hanbok. Much to explore inside which I have not finish despite the fact that it is not big. There's even a small temple at the entrance. This place is also near The KoreaHouse where traditional performances are held. "
Quaint but not a must see,This is a nice little replica of a traditional Korean Village but not something I would say is a must see. It would be better if there was more information about what you are seeing.
Good place to visit - small but quaint,"I gave this place a 3 star rating because we didn't get the full ambiance of this visit. Due to a holiday in Seoul, many of the venues were closed but we managed to walk around the grounds. If you're in Seoul for a very short visit this place would be good to visit because you can probably see it all of it within an hour or two. I wouldn't mind visiting this place again while it is in full operation."
Great Cultural Experience!,"I know that Bukchon Hanok Village is popular among toruist. But this is the place where you can see traditonal korean house and learn some korean history. It looked like an excellent place to do many traditional korean stuff like caligraphy and tea ceremony. When I went there, they provided us the opportunity to enter the house and 'take a nap'. Usually, you are bared from entering.If I had the time, I would rent a Hanbok and take some pictures here. It's nicer to wear a hanbok here and take pictures compared to taking pictures at the palaces."
Historical Look at regular Life in Korea,"No one lives in this village anymore, but the buildings give you an insight on what life would have been like before the 20th century"
Lots of fun and culture,"Great place to visit for any type of traveller. I has lots of fun there, tried traditional costumes, have taken fantastic shots of traditional buildings, the parks are amazing."
A Glimpse of Korean Culture,"This is a must see for a first timer in Seoul Korea. We went here first hour in the morning. Had our breakfast at a resto nearby. At the entrance we were greeted by a volunteer student tour guide, it was a free and good to learn more about the culture from a local. We were able to experience their games. It felt like we were in a Korean Drama featuring old Korean era. Overall, we had fun and highly recommended."
A place to visit in the morning,"If you're an early riser, most malls will not open until 10:30. So this place is a place you might want to visit.Here you're find a few sample of one style houses. A stroll in an adjacent part is also a nice experience. Plus, this place is just next to a subway station."
Second visit to show my wufe,I came here in 2016 and it was much quieter. It has now been built upon and more houses added. This old hanok village is not its original site. It's a beautiful serene place though especially the stream and rockery. Ideal picnic place. Free city wifi can be picked up here if you cannot pull yourself away from Facebook 
Learning Old Cultured at Namsangol Hanok Village,"We get there using Subway Line 4 and gett off from Changmuro Station Exit 3. We ask somebody here about the direction and here we are...we enter the gate of Namsangol Hanok Village.You can get brochure and card stamped beside the Tourist Information.we enjoy watching the buildings and park. we can sit and enjoy the ponds to relax or walking to the park.After enter the gate, you will get the ball with huge open building. this place is for meeting all the people who lives in this village. Beside the building there.s a bunch of traditional house of Korea.you can buy a ticket to learn Hangeul, or learn how to make the Korean traditional game, or how to make Hanbok, etc.You can walk around to see clearly from close the part of the house, such as living room, kitchen, bedroom, study room, work room, praying room, etc. you can see the pict i send.for me it's interesting one and grateful i found this awesome place."
If time ,If you have lots of time in Seoul....see this places. But if you have few days and not much time...you can skip this village. It's a bit hard to find if you don't have a map on you mobile!It's a regular old village 
Small Area With Beautiful Architecture and surroundings,"The buildings were beautiful and so were the surroundings. It's not a large area to visit, but I liked that it was not crowded and it was very enjoyable walking through the area. My sister, niece, and I rented hanbok from the rental place right outside. It was more expensive than the rental inside the village, but the hanbok were beautiful and the husband and wife running it were very nice. The woman even did our hair for us. I'm a korean drama fan so it was so fun - I felt like a character in a historical drama. Lol."
Great experience at the tea house,I stumbled upon their tea house by chance and had an amazing experience. All by myself in a beautiful and peaceful tea room I had an amazing tea with blooming flowers. Very transcending experience.
Korean life,"Very interesting to visit thus village with traditional Korean living, a bit hard to find from our tour stop but defibately worth a visit."
A pleasant surprise!,These are beautifully restored historical buildings that are mostly residential. Go there first thing in the morning when the sun is best for taking photographs and before the tour groups arrive.
No entrance fee :),This place is walking distance from the train station. The traditional Korean garden will welcome you as well as the view of Namsan Tower. The Korean traditional houses have been restored to preserve the original atmosphere of the area. It is ncle to try hanbok and take pictures at different locations here. It is not tiring to go around unlike the other palaces and hanok villages.
An OK visit but the hanbok rental is cheap :),"This place is near to our accommodation so basically we just walk to go there. If you are using subway, stop at chungmuro station, exit not sure. The layout of this place is just ok for me. You can see a few hanok for a few different rank. We go there twice, the first time to visit, and the second time is to try their hanbok. After surveying for a few days at a few location, we figure out that at this hanok village, we can wear hanbok at krw 10,000 for 1 hour. Other places range around krw 18,000 to krw 20,000. The hanbok is beautiful enough so no complaint. Just that you need to be there early, if not - maybe you have to wait for quite some times before your can try it out. Just a reminder, before you enter this place, there will be a shop just outside this place that also rent hanbok. If you don't mind paying higher it is ok. But thekrw10,000 per hour hanbok that I'm talking about is inside the hanok village"
An oasis in the middle of the city!,"The park was well situated right at the heart of the city. It was walking distance from our apartment. It gave us a taste of Korean culture. We were able to take lots of picture-perfect shots! What's more, no entrance fees and you can stroll around the park at your own sweet time."
Beautiful,Full of atmosphere. Lots going on. Partipation in Korean games. The stream passing thru was very photogenic. Young ladies in costume made it for me.
Fun to walk around in,It's nice to see the older part of town but important to remember that people live here. We were informed that the locals are afraid to leave their doors open as tourists simply step inside not realizing these are private homes. 
Great guide,"We had a wonderful guide who was in the eighth grade! Harry was his name! He volunteers once a month to help tourists navigate their way through the village. He was up on his history which made the village more enjoyable to visit!! He was very knowledgable and most courteous! Fabulous village, warm people, and a delight to visit! "
Namsangol,This is a great place. Peaceful and full of history. Located by Chungmuro Station. Nice view of the Seoul tower
Nice to see preserved culture,"Nice place to go for an hour or two. Preserved historic village in the the middle of Seoul. It is free and close to public transportation. If you are not a local, then this would be a nice place for you to learn about Korean culture and some history. "
Well worth a visit,"This Hanok Village is well worth a visit and has more to see than we had expected. There is no entrance fee and you can spent a pleasant hour or two in the park and viewing the traditional houses. There was live music when we visited on a Sunday afternoon and many families were out enjoying the atmosphere. This is at the foot of Namsan, so combines well with a walk up to the North Seoul Tower."
Well-Kept,Well-kept memoir of Korean history. Very accessible -- through Chungmoro subway. Different versions of Hanok houses --- with cultural shows. The park is nice and clean.There is a tea house --- where you could try the traditional tea ceremony. Souveneir shop have nice and reasonably-prices mementos. Free entrance. Overall nice experience.Recommended to all tourist who are staying near Myeongdong area (less than a kilometer walk from Myeongdong Entrance).
Korean Folk Village,When we visited this place you will be reminded of the Koreanovelas. The place is clean and so relaxing to stay at.
"Cool,serene,magical place","I missed this place in my last 2 visits to Korea..there are so much more to see , new places, new attractions, changes to keep tourists come back for new discoveries "
Cherry Blossom,"Traditional House Of Korea, good place to go and take a picture and Cherry Blossom. Big Enough and very beautiful place."
Loved the architecture,"This is a place with many traditional Korean homes, moved from areas from around Seoul, almost like a North American pioneer village.Architecture is beautiful, place is clean and it is free to get in. The surrounding park, Namsan park, is lovely in its own right. Both places have many opportunities for photos.Nice outing."
Visit history and a TV set,"This recreation of a traditional Korean village has free shows, plenty of refreshment stands, historic recreations and is also the home to many Korean TV shows. If you have a Korean friend be sure to get some photos with the cut-outs of the current TV Soap Opera locations, they will be so envious!We found the folk dancing attraction especially fun. The dancers performed amazing feats of body control, and even though the Korean music is s little jarring to western ears it was truly worthwhile, and its free, along with several other performances."
Interesting to see the traditional houses ,Not a must-see in my opinion but worth going to if you're already in the vicinity. Neat to walk around and see the traditional houses but when we were there there was hoards of tourists so it was hard to enjoy it or even get a good photo. 
Free admission to see Traditional Korean houses,Must see when you visit Seoul. You get to see the traditional houses of Koreans. In here you will also find replicas of some houses of famous people in Korean history. You will also get to see the Time Capsule of Seoul within the area.
A must see for history,Beautiful partly reconstructed ancient village showing the way of living centuries ago.Very interesting vor historically interested people
Traditional Korean Houses,"The Admission: FREE admissionThe Village: The ancient village from the Joseon period, traditional Korean houses. Good photo opportunity. You can participate in traditional culture experience programs, reservations are required with fees. The Location: Subway Line 3 or 4, Chungmuro Station. Exit 3 or 4"
Korean culture and architecture,"Traditional architecture and living habits of old Koreans are the things you will find here. Admission is free. Located near to the Chungmuro exit. It is very scenic. Overall, worth a visit."
Preserved History,The traditional houses are very interesting. When you visit the place be courteous to people living in the community. 
Cute hanok village by Namsan Park,"We went to N Seoul Tower and Namsan Park so Namsangol Hanok Village was on our way. We liked the cute little village. If you are short of time, you can see (maybe fewer but equally impressive) hanoks by Gyeongbokgung Palace. "
Traditional village replica,"I visited this place after seeing Bukchon and it was nice to see the houses open with furnitures to give a better idea how the people lived in the past. While I was there there was a group studying calligraphy, but I could not see them because the windows were closed. Some of the houses were moved to the village, what I found it was really amazing. There is a courtyard in the back where you can try traditional kids games, unfortunately I could not do because the instructions were in Korean and I did not do the tour. I went there early in the morning and it was quiet. Tourists can try some traditional activities but none were available at the time of my visit.The entrance is free and the place is located in Namsan Park, so it very easy to go from there to N Seoul Tower.To reach Namsangol Hanok Village take the Orange line 3, Chungmuro station exit 3. The entrance is just past the gas station. From there to go to N Seoul Tower, just go to Chungmuro Station exit 2 - just along the street from exit 3, and take the circular bus 2 or 5. You have the opportunity to get off in the bottom of the tower and go up a steep hill or get off close to the cable car."
Furniture,"This is a good place to come and see the houses with furniture in. So many of the museums show the houses as empty, but here they have collected together typical furniture so give a more complete look at how the people lived. Live 3 or 4, stn: Chungmuro exit 3. Free entrance."
Insight into Korean living,This village is a created area. The houses have been moved to the site. You can therefore see inside the houses. There are explanations and workshop areas.
compact reconstruction,"The exterors and interiors are meant to be authentic reconstructions, and by and large they are more chock full of refurbished exhibits. It's a good place to see glimpses of what living conditions may be like in the past, but they look very new. Can be done in 30-40 minutes if not watching a show at the pavilion or strolling through the park behind the reconstructed hanok sets. "
Visit this place on Chinese Lunar Year,"This place wasnt closed on Chinese Lunar Year eventhough many places were closed. In here you could see beautiful Korean traditional village.This place had Lunar Year Festival and there were some events for tourist who came here, such as - free rice cake- making of sweet rice puffs- making of mask and kite- traditional korean show (percussion, arts, etc)- traditional korean gameSome of the events were free, you can see my photo to know more.So visit here, if you dont know what to do in Seoul on Lunar Year."
Beautiful Village,"When the location is only 5 minutes walk from the place i stay in chungmoro, it's easy to reach. It's beautiful during the winter as the snow covers the roofs and giving great views for photos. But it was too cold during my short visit to this village as i only manage to wander around for only 30 minutes. "
Worth a visit. Free entry. Interesting housing. Beautiful scenery. ,"Very close to chungmuro station. Get out exit 3, don't go up the slope, walk straight past the petrol kiosk, follow the sign and you're there in 3 min. Nice environment and atmosphere. They moved some actual hanok onto this site. So they are not really new replicas. We went during the lunar new year festivities period and they had a lot of traditional crafts, activities and shows. Quite fun! But too cold as it was snowing hard. Fun place for kids to run around too. There's also a park at the back to explore if your interested. A nice walk around the village and feel lost in time. Transported to a different age. A gentle walking course for both young and old. "
Old Style Village,It's just another old-style village in Korea. It's just 10 minutes walking from Myeong-dong. Best hour to go: after 6 p.m. (it will be night and empty!).
Loved it!,"I loved the Hanok village, as well as the details about the history of the village. I also went to Bukchon, but it was difficult to really see a lot given that they are being lived in."
Traditional Korean Village right in the city,"I visited this village on a Sunday end of November, which I believe is the low tourist season for Seoul.Admission to this village is free, and there are free guided tours offered by volunteers.I requested for an English speaking tour, and was given a private tour by an ajusshi who spoke good English. He gave me a great overview of old Korea, the architecture, and the living habits of Koreans.I really enjoyed the 1 hour cultural immersion, and came away with a much better appreciation of Korean culture and history.Will recommend the free guided tour for history buffs and lovers of cultural visits."
close by myungdong,really great place to feel korean traditional cultureit's close from my hotel good accessibility.
Great Cultural Experience,This is a great place to learn on the living styles and habits of old Korea. It takes you back to the scenes you would have watched in the television. There is a centre outside the entrance where you could rent a Hanbok for photography too.
A Real Korean Village to Visit Right in the City,"A good place to spend your time and see how an old Korean village look like. Admission is free and right in the city. Highly recommended for tourists who want to take photographs of Korean houses, the urns used to make kimchi, and lifestyle. "
Nice place for photography ,"It's a nice place to explore the culture and history. Probably take 1 hour to walk around and there's no admission fee. You can rent hanbok outside the village for 20,000₩ for 1 hour. "
Cultural Village,"Visit on a weekend when there is a planned wedding in progress. The houses are of an older period and give a free taste of the authentic Korean culture,"
a taste of the Korean culture,We went here during the spring season which is a nice timing to witness the cherry blossom trees. It's great to explore the Korean traditional houses - like you're back in the past. Also you can see the Namsan Tower from afar.
"The real, live korean stay for a common man","Though we visited it towards evening, we could find the architectural beauty of the houses quite fascinating. The winding climbing narrow lanes take you into another world to feel the difference. There is beauty in every angle. We wish we could visit and explore the whole area. One should visit this area to experience the Korean peaceful past. Though we were prevented to to take photographs outside some houses. You get Mobile Information centres here which is a very rare thing."
"Good for a visit, its a museum and living village though","This is a free open-air museum located a short walk from exit 3 of Chungmuro station. Dont walk to the Korea house!There are five houses transplanted here. They are suppose to represent the homes of people of the different social classes during the Joseon period of Korea's history. Over weekends there are expected to be renactments of traditional Korean wedding around noon, so time your visit!Because there is no guided tour of the place, you are pretty much on your own. The Hanok village museum is part of a larger park. Sometimes there are cultural performances. Overall it is a good place to get an appreciation of traditional homes. Elsewhere, you either pay or it is a real residential area and cannot easily access. Real Hanok villages are well outside in the rural, so this gives a nice introduction."
It's alright,"Thought id so some historical sightseeing so i went to visit the hanok village. Easy to find in Seoul, this place is definitely interesting and get a sense of history of korea. However all you're doing is just walking through old villages and theres nothing informative. Probably spent an hour here, it was alright but once was enough"
"Small, nice for short stop","The place was a lot smaller than what I had imagined. Not a lot to see, but a great location to take pictures. Go here before you head to Namsan Tower. "
Enjoy the cultural village for free,"This is a lovely village and garden, smacked in the middle of metropolitan Seoul. The best part of this place is that there is no entrance fee. There are also free guided tours in English, Japanese and Chinese.I was the only person in that tour and I had a private tour cultural tour of the village. My tour guide spoke excellent English and she was very willing to answer all my questions.The gardens surrounding the village is also worth a visit and there are a scatter of art pieces around the garden."
Nice display of traditional homes and interiors,"These yangban (educated upper-class people's) homes did notoriginally exist together but were aggregated in the area to preserve their historical architecture. There are added-on experiences you can purchase, I went for the traditional calligraphy. After a brief lesson, you use brush and ink to write the Hangeul word on canvas. If you do not know Korean, the instructor will give you a word to use. There is also tea ceremony experience and hanbok (traditional clothes) wearing experience."
A beautiful gem,"It was at the end of my Seoul stay, that I still hadn't visited any hanoks, so I suggested my Korean penfriend to go and check it out, after picking up a brochure in the Tourist Information Office. (She hadn't heard about the place before, either!)It was my best idea and the highlight of my visit. It's beautiful and charming! If you have the time, I suggest you plan to spend some time there and just enjoy the environment.We visited on a Saturday, but relatively early, before 11, so there weren't too many people.You can participate in various programmes and there's a traditional wedding ceremony every 2 hours, at 11, 1pm and 3pm. These are real weddings, not re-enactments!You have to pay a fee for the activities/workshops - prices vary, but attending the wedding and visiting the village is free.If you need to pick up some traditional gifts, the gift shop is excellent."
A place to visit for Korea culture,A man-made korea cultural village. Full with different kind of buildings and tools which imitate ancient Korea village. Hanbok can be rented here for experience and photography. 
Preservation of national culture,"In the middle of Seoul, The Korean government brought together 5 traditional houses to help people remember their past. Well worth a visit. Entrance is free. There are students who have assignments to act as guides. Free of charge."
A nice place for traditional buildings,This place may sound like its similar to the Bukchok Hanok village but its not even close. This plase is more similar to a temple complex than a village. It got several old housings and gives a nice insight in old korean living.
Beautiful place,"This peaceful village is a wonderful spot to encounter traditional Korean culture. It features five types of houses from the Joseon era, that have been relocated here from different parts of Seoul. The entrance to the Namsangol Hanok Village is free, but the activities come with a small chargeable fee."
Garden of beauty in South Korea,1) The place has no entrance fee. It is definitely free.2) Has a number of Korean traditional houses and the breathtaking view o f its garden.3) Visitor can see the Time Capsule which will be opened on 29nov2394
Hanbok experience ,"We went there in group like 15 people, we rent hanbok just ouside the Hanok Village. It costs us $20 for one person. And we walk inside the village with hanbok. Interior feels like you are back to old centuries. Its free admission."
Great with a guide,We took an hour long free tour in English and were the only two people on the tour. Our guide was very knowledgeable and explained many interesting things about the buildings but also about Korea itself. I'd recommend getting a tour as the signage on the site is good but limited. The guide brought it to life. 
Nice Garden and Village!,"After our lunch as part of our full day city tour, we dropped by here for a visit. Well, some may feel that this place is a ""me too"" replica from other Hanok Villages but we feel it has its unique offering and still worthwhile for a visit to experience different time.Other than some of the old and traditional houses and buildings (but no one is living here), what this place offered was a massive garden that is so serene and tranquil. Upon entering and after a short walk, you will see a lovely pond with lots of fishes (i.e. Koi) swimming and birds flying around in a greenery and nature environment. Walking further, you will come by a section where fruit trees and vegetables are grown.Walking further in, there is an open field where the operator placed traditional Korean games here and visitors could grab one up and play, to enjoy the past time activity. What is interesting is the place where the Time Capsule that was buried here in 1994 to mark Seoul’s 600 Year Anniversary and is scheduled to be reopened in 2394!!! On top of it was the inscribed well wishes by well known political leaders and celebrities around the world.There is also a section where the theatre and tea house is located (next to each other). Unfortunately we didn't make it on time for the performance but did dropby for some tea. It was good!It was a good visit here despite the fact that the weather was sunny and warm. Do if you plan to come here, do remember to bring along an umbrella, hat and drinking water. Also recommended to put on a pair of comfortable or sport shoes as there are lots of walking to be done to be able to enjoy the scenic view of the nature!The washrooms/souvenir shop are located near the main entrance on the right. In fact, right here, the national flower of Korea, the Rose of Sharon could be seen, very nice. There are also static photo standee here of characters wearing ancient Korea costumes.Admission is free. Highly recommended."
Easy to reach,"We wanted to watch the Martial arts show. Pretty easy to reach from the subway stop, about 2 short blocks. Nice there is no admission price. Took lots of photos. Oppressively hot and humid, not much shade nor air conditioned places to pop in to cool off. The lake was pretty. The show was good, but quite staged, set to music, lots of board breaking. Would be a good circus act. "
smiliar to bukchon village,"The entrance is free and it looks like the Old village next to the royal palace. It's not a must if you have already seen the Bukchon Palace, but here there are no people living inside the houses and there is a park around the village. Once thing i really like here, you can look inside the rooms, which are furnitured, to have a better impression of how people lived in this houses. That's something i really missed in Bukchon Village and also in the Gyeongbokgung palace. ...Big + for Namsangol Village"
Wonderful,This was not here when we last visited in 1996. We loved walking through the village and the garden paths and coming across the lovely little water falls. Thoroughly enjoyed!
nice,"we take metro for this village, but it woerth it. you can see hanok stile houses, traditional tes ceramony, some traditional korean arts."
Very Nice Village,This village is like stepping back into time. If you take a seat on a step and just look around you can picture the everyday life there.
A bit fake,"It is nice to visit if you do not know anything about Korea, but it is not a real old village. They just rebuilt houses in the style of different Korean eras. Too crowded during national holidays, but they normally organize activities for kids (so it is a good place to go for them)."
Great stroll through historical architecture,"I was pleasantly surprised at how few people were at this village, it's a great walk through. We did not venture into the garden, as it was far too hot/humid, but really enjoyed the opportunity to see historic Korean buildings.Great place to visit and gain some education about historic Korea. And, it's free!!"
Nice place,Namsangol Hanok Village was nice place .Good for visiting and relaxing .A lot local people visiting ...
Peaceful place and not so crowded!,"I was surprised on the day we went to visit Namsangol Hanok Village. It was not so crowded and everything was so well maintenance. There was a taekwondo show in a middle of the day, it was awesome!  "
"Sunny days are best, but don't be put off by the rain!","Namsangol Hanok Village is a reconstruction of a number of traditional Korean houses, put together like a genuine village. Admission is free, and visitors can wander round the outer precincts, from which colourful interiors can be viewed. There is a charge, however, if one wants to try on traditional costumes, participate in a tea ceremony, or have a conducted tour. One can take a head-in-the-hole photograph without payment, and pretend to be a traditional Korean villager or a Confucian scholar. There is also a tasteful gift shop and a café.The grounds also contain a time capsule, where typical objects from our present time were buried in 1994, not to be reopened until the year 2394.It is best visited on a dry day. There is a large covered booth near the entrance, overlooking a small lake with lotus flowers, but most of one’s visit involved walking around in the open. Our visit was on a rainy day, but we enjoyed it nonetheless."
Loving the old style of living,Enjoyed the culture of this place immensely! We were able to witness a tea ceremony here. I was in Korea many years ago and seeing this was just the way I remember it. Homes in a square with a well in the middle. The traditional style of eating with a low table and cushions to sit on. The roofs are amazing. The did a fantastic job of recreating this old town !
Architecture peek,"If you want a sense of how people lived and are happy to wander yourself, quietly in your own time, this is a good option. They have 5 houses to view of varying social levels for you to see how the people lived. You can also book a tea ceremony lesson and try on traditional clothing."
It's Free!,"The village is free. The area is clean and concentrate. The traditional houses are kept nice. Most importantly, it's free with a lot of optional fee-charged activities at your choice."
Nice traditional village,"Interesting traditional village, where you can discover several aspects of Korean culture: architecture, traditions, food,... All this in a very peaceful atmosphere, surrounded by ponds and gardens. If you're lucky, there are traditional dance shows organized for visitors."
A village of traditional houses,"This peaceful village is a wonderful spot to encounter traditional Korean culture. It features 5 different yangban (upper class) houses from Joseon era, all relocated here from different part of Seoul."
Re-built Hanok,"Namsangol Hanok Village was traditional Korean houses that were rebuilt at the foot of Namsan mountain mainly for tourism. Inside the village, different types of houses with different interior designs indicated the life style of different classes in the old times. Lot of tourists rent Korean Hanbok from the shops there for taking pictures. It was more like a park than a historic site.To get there, take the subway to Chungmuro Station Exit 3 and look for a gas station, then you will find the road to the Village. Entrance fee was waived on the day of our visit."
A very nice walk in good weather,"Easy to find and very interesting and attractive, Good to fill in an hour or two. Well worth a visit to adsorb some Korean culture."
Nice village to see how koreans lived and their buildings,Nice village to have a look around on how the old traditions were and how they built their villages. Well maintained and with information in english as well.
Beautiful place,"It is a shame that it is in a difficult place to find. Looks like someone is hiding it, but when you go in, you find a beautiful treasure. "
Namsangol hanook village ,My family and I visited the village on 2nd July 2016 and was fortunate to witness a real wedding being conducted there. There are shows being conducted to acquaint the visitors on the various aspects of Korean culture. However beside the village was a huge park with waterfalls and an area dedicated to a time capsule being laid at the bottom of a tunnel. Just be prepared to do do a lot of walking up and down. Entrance is free. 
No village as highlighted,"We went to this place with special interest as we wanted to see typical korean village. it was located in a hill but hardly any village types houses seen. All areas are commercialised with shops and restaurants. One house is converted into rural museum and after paying huge amount for entry, we did not get to see much of rural korea. "
"Beautiful place, hours of sight-seeing","It is a beautiful village that gives you a feel of what life was like back in the days. The structures are beautiful, the gardens are beautiful, there are quite a few fun and cheap activities to participate in. We tried the tea ceremony, which is a one on two experience where a staff member brewed you a pot of tea and offered you a couple of different sweet snacks inside one of the buildings. Ok, the snacks were that good but it was the experience I was buying. For a small fee, we also had the chance to put on traditional Korean clothing (quite a few selection to choose from) and posed for pictures inside another building. I recommend going there early so there are fewer people. We get to experience the above activities on our own without other people in the way. Just after we finish with our traditional clothing, a few groups of people were already there waiting and ""fighting"" over their preferred clothes. Another activity I wanted to try was the brush calligraphy session but for some reasons, it wasn't available until a couple of days later. I didn't realise there are seasons to calligraphy writing... Anyway, overall it was a great place to visit, I recommend this place over the Gyeongbokgung Palace."
Reconstructed Traditional Village,We took the English tour given by a delightful woman. She explained each of the buildings and explained the traditional beliefs and culture of that time. Just outside the village you can take the number 2 bus up to the top of nearby Mt. Namson to visit the Namson Seoul Tower to save you time and a long walk up. 
Nice stroll around the place and it's not crowded with people,"Visit this village in the morning and it wasn't crowded at all. Nice to see how the older generation lived but after awhile, they all seem similar. Suitable for a short visit.The whole place isn't that big so it won't take long to walk around."
a look into the past,stroll and catch a glimpse into the old traditional village. nearby good find - kimbap store right at the entrance.
Traditional Korean village,"If you want to see a traditional Korean village, this is the place to be. We were lucky then that entrance fee is free. I think that was a Wednesday. The village is well maintained, clean and complete with traditional stuff.. They even have houses with the traditional bed, cooking materials and even the medicinal plants are also grown in the village. A must visit when in Korea."
Tranquility in the city......,"The historical buildings are set in a spacious and beautifully landscaped park. It can be accessed easily from Chungmuru subway station and entrance is free! I was there in the morning and it was not crowded at all. A really good way to start off the day before facing the crowds at other tourist attractions. I was able to admire the scenery and take pictures with no one at the background. My family took a tea appreciation experience workshop at the Hanok. It cost 4000 Won per person and it was a fun experience learning how to make tea with our pretty and gentle 'teacher'. We were served little snacks to go with our tea and we could take pictures inside the room with olden Korean decoration. There are other 'experiences' that you can take part in and they are generally not expensive. If you have no time to visit Korean Folk Village or Bukchon Hanok, take some time to visit Namsangol Hanok Village since it has a little of what both places have to offer. It is situated between Myeongdong and Dongdaemum and would be refreshing for the tired shoppers. We had a relaxing time just walking around the place and being away from the crowd."
Conveniently located Historical Village,"This hanok village is right near Myeong-dong at the base of Namsan mountain. You can wander around the small village to see how people lived in the past or even have your photo taken in Korean traditional dress. Then you can walk around the adjacent park. It makes a very pleasant respite from the frenetic pace of the nearby city. You only have to pay if you want to do the optional activites (eg; Hanok dress), otherwise it is free. Arrive early or at lunchtime when the tour groups are not around, to avoid crowds."
Historical architecture in the heart of a modern district,"The old buildings in this park are well preserved and there are English signs that explain the information about the buildings. The park is also beautiful and relaxing (but avoid weekends, it gets crowded). It is free and a nice stop on the way to Namsam Mountain or the nearby Myeong-dong shopping area. Price is FREE!!"
Very interesting and peaceful place,This historical site consists of a group of hanoks that were moved to the park. The park is a peaceful respite at the north edge of Namsam Park. The hanoks are well-refurbished and furnished to give a real feel for the era. We greatly enjoyed are stroll through the place. It can easily be done in 1-2 hours.
Amazing,"The village looks very well maintained and it gives an insight of the way people live in the olden days in Korea. The complex is actually very big and it comprises not only the village, but also a large park. Definitely worth a visit."
Korean Traditional Village,"Historical village in mid-city, great piece of architecture. It is open to the public. It is very nice walking in to this village and taking pictures."
Traditional,good walking streets. Preserved the tradition.close to the palace. It is very nice walking in to this place and taking pictures in the traditional attire
A Village of Traditional Houses in the Namsan Valley,"Namsangol Hanok Village is a Village of Traditional Houses in the Namsan Valley, it is a Korean village located in the area of Pil-dong neighborhood in Jung-gu, a central district of Seoul, South Korea where hanok or Korean traditional houses have been restored to preserve the original atmosphere of the area.The Namsangol Hanok Village offers one the opportunity to experience a wide cross-section of Joseon-era citizenry and activities, from royalty to commoners. A great effort has been made to accurately furnish each dwelling with appropriate era and social status appointments."
Enjoyed this traditional Hanok village,Visited here as part of a tour. It was very interesting but I've heard that the Bukchon village is better and has traditional crafts and tea shops. Overall interesting. 
Little to learn,A small part of retained village for tourists to see how koreans lived in village. Big spread. would have been useful if free guide is provided.
nice village,"very nice place, we walked there wearing hanbok clothes..very nice to take a picture and see how they lived years ago"
Experience the historical culture and tradisional!,"Historical sites of traditional village of old era. Seeing and experience the life with historical building and artifacts, beautiful scenic views and ponds. Social activities conducted here as well by school and other organizations. One way of introducing Korea to foreigners."
Average: don't get your expectations up,"I only had an afternoon to spend freely, so I was debating between this place and the other Korean village place in Samcheongdong/Bukchon (more famous/popular), this place was closer to where I was staying so I decided to go. It is is free of entry, and there are activities (fees apply) related to Korean culture you could pay a reasonable fee to enjoy. But this place was actually smaller than I expected and I didn't find it too interesting."
How regular people used to live,"After seeing 3 palaces it was nice to finally see how the regular people used to live. The village is free, close to metro and the N Tower cable car. It's best to see in the evening to catch it both in the day light and after susnest when all the lanterns are lit"
interesting and educational,"If you want to get a sense of Korean home life before modernization, this is a great place to stop. Near the subway and Namsan mountain."
Historical village in mid-city,Five houses remain in this village set in a large area within the busy city of Seoul. It is a major tourist attraction and gives a good idea of traditional architectural styles.
Great piece of architecture,"Must see place, right in center of the city of Seoul. Great scenery and authentic houses on the hills. Nice attraction to visit when in Seoul"
Away from the busy city..,"Treat it as a walk in the park but the bonus would be the opportunity to look inside authentic old houses and ponds at the same time. As this is a tourist attraction, buses with tourists would appear."
Lovely slice of history in the City,"Hanok means a traditional house. This historical village museum is a vast area housing 5 different types of Hanoks, ranging from a house of a carpenter to a King/ Statesman. A must visit for the beautiful houses, and a stroll through the history and culture."
Great stop in Seoul,Peaceful glimpse into the history of South Korea. Had a great time seeing the arts and artifacts. Cool to see the architecture in the middle of Seoul. Bathrooms are not the best though
A glimpse of old Korea. ,Looking for a place to see how Koreans lived before? Check this place out. Some houses were that of nobles and influential people in their society. Traditional Korean houses and way of life are also displayed. There's a coffee and souvenir shop near the entrance in case you want one. 
Great way to experience the real S Korea,"We decided to stay at one of the local Hanoks for a night just to experience it. The kids loved it, as did we, but the hard floor and thin mattresses an acquired taste for westerners! The traditional breakfast is a must, as is a wander around the entire are. The narrow streets are very atmospheric, very clean and tidy, and we felt safe at all times. Definitely worth a visit"
Useful for tourist,"I am not sure how authentic the village is (it is a model, there are no residents), but for a visitor it provides a useful sample of old Korean buildings. There are several activities throughout the day and the information was very good."
nice view externally,"nice view of the building architectures, the hanbok experience is no longer free, charges at 20,000KRW. surprise to feel that olden Koreans are small in size, the doors and stairs look tiny for the Koreans nowadays."
Historic building museum,This village is assembled from old houses around Seoul that needed to move. It's a lovely collection of best old architecture set up in a lovely garden. I particulary enjoyed the Korean games you can try in different places. Unfortunately the Taekwndo Show only starts in May so we missed that.
Peace,A very peaceful place....it's a bit like the OK corral in Korea in places. Beautiful structures and serene music playing. ....free WiFi throughout! 
Free!,I surprise they allow people to visit this place free. It's a nice place to visit and look at how the old houses in the village looks like. Pretty nice visit.
Free and Worth Visiting,"It has quite a lot to look around. It was well equipped and well maintained. It is free, and worth visiting. "
Quaint little village,"If you would like to see how the (probably rich) Koreans lived back in the days, then this is the place to visit. The attraction is free, and you can roam around the 5 abodes. It was supposed to be a time filler but we were pleasantly surprised."
Experience for Korea traditional life,"Hanko is the Traditional House's name of Korea. You can enter this house and see the rooms, furniture. Also can experience the traditonal games. Sometimes you can see the traditional music performance at this place. You can go to the N Seoul Tower from hear. "
A nice park for chill,Just 3 mins walking distance from subway. Some tradition Korean games are provided in the middlr of the park. A place for chill...
Traditional house in the middle of the city,"Located in the middle of the city, close to myeong dong area, i found this place accidentally when i just back from myeong dong shopping area...Very nice and not to crowded, free entry when u come in the morning..."
Traditional Korean Village in the city,"To visit this place you can take bus 05 and stop at Namsangol Hanok Village. take a walk around 150m and you will find the gate to enter this village. This place is free of charge. Inside the village you could see traditional old Korean house, park, etc. It is a must visit place for people that like historical place"
"Just an historical reconstruction,nothing more","If you have time and want to see some traditional houses, then I suggest to visit the Bukchon village and not this sort of reconstruction which is only a turist attraction. The only positive thing is a park inside where families and children could play together in open air space."
A peak at Korea's history,"This place is big! It's not just a good area to sight see but would also be a good place to hang out and just enjoy the view or go for a walk. Here, you can take a glimpse of how people in Korea used to live. You can see what the houses look like and what it has inside as well."
You can se this in 7 minutes but the tour took an hour!,"The Namsangol Hanok village features a few old (1880's) houses that have been reassembled on the site featuring jointed woodwork, hypocaust style heating and some typical furniture. The environment is one of concrete surfaces and a dried up stream - not very rural or green at all. The site also features the so called time-capsule buried in 1994 and due to be opened in 600 years time. Our future ancestors may struggle to 'read' the CD and DVD buried deep in the earth...but it won't be our concern!We took the one hour free guided tour but although the volunteer guide was lovely, with good English and clearly a genuine interest in the site....it was all a bit boring actually! Sorry to be so negative....but this place did little for me!"
Nice area,There is a tourist office close to the Metro exit. Go in and get a map of the area. We found the lady in the Tourist office very helpful and her English was good.Honestly the houses were very beautiful but not a lot to see or do. There are Hanok houses on two sides of the road. Once you walk around and take a few pictures then you are done.When started on the same side as the tourist office and then cross over and finished on the higher ground. There are steps at the top which lead down to a street which is really arty and has lots of places to eat. We went to the first Korean place we met and had a great meal for small money.
Absolutely beautiful,Forget about the boring and uninteresting Bukchon Village. This is the one you want to see. Many houses of the olden corean days. Very nice walk. Highly recommended.
"Nice, take a picture with hanbok","The village is very quite and nice.I have experience in take picture with hanbok.The name of hanbok studio is Ariang, just the right side of village. You can rent the hanbok for 01 hour, the fee is 20.000wonOr you can take picture in the studio (they will photoshop for you and print 03 pictures) with the fee is 10000won/person.It is very nice and tradiontional."
It is close to the Chungmuro Metro Station and the admission is free,"The Hanok Village is close to Chungmuro Metro Station and the admission is free, do pay a visit when you are around the area."
Interesting way to learn,"The village offers a lot of information that you can learn about Korea's rich culture and history. For someone doing a transit tour, the place is really amazing."
Rich in history,A short walk from the Chungmuro subway stop on the #3 line. Take the #3 exit from the station.This is a collection of historic buildings many of which were moved from their original locations. Spent half a day enjoying the Village and the grounds. 
Dated,"Really let down by this place, my kids (6 & 8) were of the age where one could get on all the rides and the other couldn't, all the rides for the younger one was really baby'ish. The place is generally very tired "
Nice and beautiful,It's a lovely village but nothing to do that much. Nice place to take a photo and look at old village style of korea
Quick peek into Korean culture,Two things you must do here 1. Rent hanbok to wear for photo taking (so pretty!)2. Go to the tea house in the village and have a nice cool quencher in summer 
Beautiful snow day,It was snowing and we immediately made our way here. It's so conveniently located near the station. Snow covered all trees n pavement. You would not believe this place is right in a city. It's beautiful and we were do engrossed in snow activities and picture taking that we forgot about the indoor tour around the house. There is this nice little eatery near the entrance that supposedly serve 'ugly but tasty gimbap'...We were too full to add that in our order but we saw that it was popular. Loved it!
culture village,i discovered this place when i was walking to Myeong-dong.i quite this place and it just under the N Seoul tower.it has tea room and time capsule too.
Going back to olden days of Seoul,"This is a place everyone must go if you are in Seoul, you can see unique buildings and lots for shoppers. Enjoy the olden days of Seoul here."
Pretty,English and chinese free guided tour is available. Easily located at chungmuro exit 3/4. Pretty structure . They have a time capsule garden at the back which is worth a visit.
Namsangol Hanok Village,A must visit place for tourists. It has a lot of tradition houses and the location is very clean. Great place for photos too.
"Not enough information, or diversity is housing type, to be more than a photo op","After spending a wonderful afternoon at Lin An Tai historical house and museum in Taipei the previous year, I was looking for a similar experience. This was not it. Unlike Lin An Tai, there was very little information provided on site at Namsangol, and nearly nothing provided to explain the style, age, and architectural influences of the collected homes, nor what the individual rooms in the home would have been used for (other than an occasional note about a main room or a temple.) I suspect that this lack was not only in English, as the number of signs was very limited. It's a pretty area, surrounded by a very metro neighborhood, so might be nice for pictures, but I would have rather spent my time at something truly interesting and historically informative."
Namsangol Hanok Village,"Peaceful beautiful. Autumn leaves were awesome. I sat by the pond for a long time just breathing in the air and scenery, wishing I never had to leave. Love love looking at the hanoks too."
Traditional hanok village,"Exit Chungmuro Subway Station and walk a few minutes to the village which is at the base of Nam mountain. It a little small compared to others around Korea but you can see many similar buildings and features. I recommend getting a drink and snacks before entering, I happened to go when they had a martial arts demo and there were many activities for children. I don't think they have these activities everyday. You can spend an hour or two walking around so if you need a break from myeongdong shopping, this is a nice spot."
Worth A Look,"A small village in the middle of Seoul,about a 10 minute walk from Myeongdong Station.Interesting Hanoks and you can participate in various activities if you wish to.We were very lucky as the Korean show Infinity Challenge was filming there and we were able to watch and see some of the celebrities."
Traditional village near Mt. Namsan,"Village may not the the biggest or the most authentic one, but it is located near Mt. Namsan and you can have a nice walk to Namsan Cable Car Station and to NTower, so it is good to put these attractions together if you are in the area.You can't go inside buildings, but it gives you some idea how such traditional houses looked like."
It's a right choice to experince the view of traditional Korean houses from Joseon Era,"I went there during winter and it was freaking cold, but the snowy view here was priceless. Ice houses were built during this season and you could take lot of good photographs. There were a lot of traditional houses that could be explored and they're well-maintained even those houses were built thousand years ago from Joseon Era, but I still could feel the original and the beautiful scene. Namsan Hanok Village can be accessed by taking metro Line 3 or Line 4 to Chungmuro Station Exit 3 or 4"
A little hint in story,"the Hanok , living in One of them too is Something no to miss even if you are on a strict Budget, One night of treatment in a Hanok is worthed "
Must visit,"An old village which they have reserved well. I luckily was here when they held a traditional wedding so it was a unique experience. The landscape, the houses are beautiful. Can also wear hanbok, the professional photographer will shoot for you in one hour and you get two printed photos, plus they send all pictures by email to you a few days later. Love it :)"
An underrated gem.,"Original houses in near-original condition. You must have or join a (free) tour guide. The buildings represent the heart of Korea. Under-floor heating, for example, has influenced how they sit, eat and sleep, and socialise. Even the curve of the familiar curved roof ridges differentiate them from similar Chinese and Japanese buildings, in an idiosyncratically Korean way."
Hanok Village - Should be better ........,"From Seoul station, take a bus to the village. It should be more fascinating as the name is , only very few Korean traditional houses so travelers could rent gowns & have pictures taken as a memory of their trip to Korea.Nothing exciting , just walk around the alleys, drop by to have tea, beverages or some little fast Korean food. Only if you have finished all the interesting attractions, drop by if you have time."
Easy was to see korean traditional architecure,"Another option in Seoul to see more examples of Korean architecture, especially if you don't want to navigate the alley ways and climb your way to the Bukcheon Hanok Village.This tourist attraction is usually quite busy, especially during the warm months. On weekends it's overrun with tourists and weekdays with school children as many school have picnics and field trips here. However, if you want a chance to take more pictures of Korean style houses, it's at least worth a stop by. "
A little bit boring,"After visiting a lof of other Korean folk villages and the palace, I think this artificial Hanok village is a little bit boring. "
Traditional Korean Houses,There were few houses on display and getting inside the house is not allowed but you can still see the interior of the house for picture taking.
Just plain average,The only reason why I'm going here because it is within walking distance from my hotel. Just an average experience. Nothing special. 
Interesting cultural village..,"Alhough smaller and kinda replica compare to Bukchon, this small museum village is interesting to learn the way the korean lived. The village range from low to mid level living quarter. Recomended for kids, but dont forget also to visit the Bukchon version."
Real old Korea,This is located in the center of Seoul and can feel the real old Korea style. It is good to walk
"Good hanok village, kids friendly","We went here from Namsan park, because our guesthouse was at the back of this village. All the scenery was beautiful. When we came, there was no event here, due to winter time. But our kids had so much fun to look around. I recommended this place for family, with young kids, who want to see hanok and inside the hanok. It is easy to walk here. And it's free."
Interesting Ancient Village,It covers quite a large area. Quite a number of interesting buildings and antique things to look at. An open area for traditional games. A good view of N Seoul Tower too. Easy access by public transport.
lovely but not worth more than a couple of visits,nice to know a hankok village sits in the center of Seoul. memorable but won't offer anything beyond imagination.
Namsangol Hanok Village,I went there at night time around 6p.m and it was kind of scary because at that time there was no one there and there were just empty buildings all around you. My advice for you is to go there during day time.
Go to Bukchon Instead,"Not that attractive compared to Bukchon. More on a ""man-made"" Hanok Village. Nothing much to see. If you are pressed with time, you can actually let go of this."
2 hours at Namsangol Hanok Village,"it's free admission, if you have a few hours to kill, make a visit.good for photos, and get to know how the Korean houses look in the past.Walking distance to Insadong."
Nice free attraction,It has 5 Joseon-era houses that have been restored. Volunteer guides are available during the weekends who can give more details about the houses. The park surrounding the area is a nice place to relax. One of the better free attractions in Seoul.
Hanok architecture,To have a look at the traditional Koran architecture it is recommended to visit Namsangol Hanok village and enjoy in peace a stroll through nicely lined houses and a park.
Nice Scenery,Nice place with lot of ancient village. Good place for photography and it is free admission. It be easily access via public transport. 
Beautifully maintained,"Love the village. There's also food festival when I went there, and I get to try making some of their traditional sweets for free. There's demos for making traditional clothes and so much for. In all, there's a lot to see here. "
A more peaceful ancient Korean Heritage,This Namsangol Hanok village have 3 blocks of ancient Korean Nobles' houses which were moved from Buchon Hanok village. All the houses are still well maintain. It is very interesting to know how the ancient time the rich nobles Korean houses structure were build to keep away heat of summer and remain warm during the winter. This Namsangol Hanok houses are different from Buchon Hanok village because there are no residents reside in . Therefore the interior are still remain the same and not modernized to reside people.
Nice cultural place,"Namsangol Hanok Village has a traditional house for you to view.The place allows you to have a feel of the local traditional culture. The get there, take the metro to Chungmuro Station. Get out at exit 3. "
A compilation of traditional folk houses,Visit the namsangol hanok village to learn about the tradition of korean and what they stayed in during the past. There are also details such as their living culture. You also got to try out the traditional costume in here.
Nearby,yes there is such a traditional korean place at the nearby town and only few walks away from the highway and subway. it's great walking around and having a somewhat experience of the tradional korean lifestyle
Very Nice,"It's a great place to stroll around in, experience and feel traditional Korean culture. The place is quiet even with a lot of people milling about."
Loved It!!,"Traditional Korean Village, This village has five restored traditional Korean houses and a pavilion, a pond, which make it a perfect spot to take a walk.There are spots where on the ground traditional games are made. During the weekends, traditional marriages are shown at Bak Yeong Hyo's Residence. The groom and bride in traditional attire, you can quickly grab a foto with them.We loved this place!"
Calm park and old traditional houses.,"I visited Namsangol Hanok Village a beautiful October day when weather was great. Saw an amazing taekwondo show, walked the tranquil park. Sat in the sun and watched the nice colors of the trees preparing for fall. Not many people. Great if whether is good. I spent 2 hours here.Also strolled around the traditional houses. The had different traditional activities to try, like dress up in traditional Korean clothes. Didn't try any of that. Really nice place if you want to get away from the buzz in the big city!"
Save it for dead last on your trip,"The buildings are genuine but the ""village"" is an artifice. Essentially, it is a collection of 5 wealthy families’ homes relocated to this spot and landscaped to appear to represent a natural setting.“Homes” is really a misnomer; these are the equivalent of today’s mansions. Though not overly picturesque or photogenic, they are, when examined patiently, a good glimpse into household life during that period (including how they used fire pits under the various living quarters as radiant heat).Try to get here as soon as the place opens. As the day progresses, it will inevitably become completely over-run by busload after busload after busload of Chinese tourists. At no other sight will you see such a concentrated number of tourists from China. I don’t know why but this place is apparently a very popular, “must see” sight with all the tour groups. It amounts to a large number of people occupying a relatively small parcel of land. At times you will find yourself very distracted. It’s quite strange because there are no busloads of anyone from any other country.This is far from a “must see” sight. I would save this as filler at the end of your stay in Seoul; don’t risk sacrificing any prime sight or sights on your list to go here.On Wednesdays and Saturdays there are Taekwondo exhibitions by children and young teens, which adds to the touristy, carnival-like atmosphere. Keep in mind, the village is closed on Tuesdays; although you can walk the grounds, access to the homes is not possible.I wish they would re-name two stars ""below average"" because ""poor"" has a distinct negative connotation. I would give it two stars but for that reason."
An insight into the past,"The Hanok Village is a collection of traditional Korean houses which have been moved onto a complex and rebuilt as they had been. It gives a fascinating insight into how Korean families lived in the past.We went at a quiet time in the village, around 16.30/17.00 so there were few people around but there was no food or drink place open despite the normally long opening hours of the café!"
Treasure and Historical,"Treasure.....this place amused me. I thought this place will be located in a very hidden place. but I'm wrong, is located in a city, it definitely gives me a WOW feeling. Also, is kinda impress that the building remain so well and beautiful. Overall, nice place"
Namsangol Hanok Village on Chuseok,"Overall good experience. There were quite a lot of people- especially families with children. Only a few food stalls mostly selling traditional rice cakes, hotteok etc.They also have a special event schedule for the day with some traditional dancing and other performances."
Below expectation,"This place is small. We expected expected a bigger Hanok Village with real living people in it like in Hoi An, Vietnam. By the way, it's free and this is our first Hanok Village visit in our life."
I would pick something else to visit,Suggested by our guide. It was relaxing but I think there are other attractions more interesting. We saw the old ways to make Kimchee.
Interesting history tour,We did a tour go during the week less visitors . Our guide was very informative with the history of hanok . The houses had been shifted there from another place . It gave you a inside view of how they slept cooked and lived life in there village years ago
Not worth the time,Please ignore this place as it has nothing interesting or worthy about it . Totally deserted and barren - went with high hopes only to crash it
Walk around ,Free entry. Easy to get around. Not sure how wheelchairs manage the high step in to each area We walked to this coming down from the Seoul tower through Namsan park and then back to exit12 beside hotel Also plenty of water toilets and outdoor exercise equipment Hilly and many steps 
great place and great experience,"I came here during Korea's summer vacation week - I think. so, when I arrived, there was a 'free walking course' by teenagers - about 16 years old for them to practice English, and also a teacher assists and encourage them to speak english and also introduce how traditional houses build as smart house, i.e : heat from in-door kitchen is circulated to main house."
Surprisingly good,"It is conveniently located, not far from Chungmuro station (line 4) exit 4. Free admission and you can get to experience a traditional Korean village there more leisurely than bukchon hanok village, which involves a lot of tough walking.The hanbok experience and arrow making class (fee applies) are the highlights of the visit. The hanbok there are new & beautiful and you are allowed to take photos inside a traditional Korean house, which is great in my opinion."
Traditional historic Korean village.,This place features a variety of houses and other buildings in a beautiful garden setting showing how life was hundreds of years ago.
Not much there,Unfortunately in the winter a bit of nothing and wouldn't really bother. I think in the summer they do more activities there.
Hidden Gem!,"I'm glad I found this little gem on the way to the train station. There was also a photo studio where you can dress up with traditional clothes, get your photo taken and even walk around around the village! It was pretty cool. Overall, I still consider this a little treasure."
better than Buckchon,"I'm visit two of Hanok village at Seoul, this place better than the other one (Buckcon). But, Namsangol is like a museum, there's not a real village as at Buckcon. But, you can taking a photo better than because the buildings looks real. suggest for visiting in the morning, not to crowded and you can enjoy the garden."
Nothing noteworthy,"This hanok village with its handful of traditional Korean houses was a bit boring for my tastes. The 5 houses all looked the same to me and there wasn't much information about them, apart from who they were built for and when and some architectural details. You could not go inside any of the buildings, so my visit was very short."
Nice walk! What I was looking for!,Loved walking the streets in the early morning. had the place almost to myself. Some nice viewpoints up the hill! Great walk!
Finding it was an accident but well worth the trip,"Me and my wife was looking around Myeongdong and just decided to walk....well we walk pretty far and then we found the village. It was great seeing how my ancestors lived many years ago. The design of the building was very nice as well. I find it hard to believe Koreans were so short back in those days. The houses were pretty small in height and my wife's head touched the bottom of a doorway, and she is 63"". If you keep walking towards the rear of the village you will stumble across the time capsule. I also played a game of tuho and out of everybody that played, I was the only one to get my dart into the small hole. You have to try it, pretty sure it would make an ""excellent"" drinking game as well lol."
A peak inside a tradtional house,If you want to get the feeling of how houses were traditionally furnished this is a good place to go. You can also walk around it in traditional clothing for $5. A great place to take pictures. The houses were moved from other areas so there is a good amount of space to walk around them as opposed to bukchon. Bukchon has more houses but you can only go in the few that are stores or workshops. 
You have to see this place,Spent a few days here on return trip to USA. There is so much to do and see and this is a must see. An oasis in the city. Very beautiful and easy to find with local map. We walked there from Myeongdong shopping disctrict. 
Worth taking a look at,"Our hotel was nearby so we strolled around for few hours. You get nice pictures here and it's free, but there's not that much to do around the hanok village. Few pretty nice cafes here and there but not much more, worth going for the ""old village""- type of pictures though."
A great village to visit after the Gyeongbokgung palace,It is great to combine this village with the Gyeongbokgung palace at the same day. It is easy to compare daily life of royalty and normal citizens of Korea. It also has a time capsule to celebrate Seoul 600th anniversary.
Visit during the harvest festival,"If you get the opportunity to travel here during a traditional festival, particularly the harvest festival then there is a lot to experience and interactive activities too"
In to the housing culture ,"With the help of a korean friend, now we understand how they used to live, the traditional way of celebrating theirs ancestors and the day by day.It was nice place to be and spend no more than 2 hr there, the kids loved it because it was not a long walk."
A short break with nature in the city,"I have been to this place just by pure luck when we were wandering around with my mum. Sadly it was lunch time and that's why most of the workshops were on break but still it was good enough to make us happy with its nature and well designed structure. We bought many items from the gift shop inside. It is not the cheapest but definitely normal prices; if you find something you like, definitely go for it."
Great place to familiarize yourself with history and culture.,"This place is a good stop if you only have a few hours in Seoul. You can see old style houses, try traditional games and activities, eat traditional food and watch cultural shows."
"At base of N Seoul Tower, great for photos, not to visit.","Our next stop was the Namsangol Hanok Village. By the time we found it, it was high noon and it was too scorching hot for my liking and I admit, I was acting like a spoiled brat. The village was literally close to the N Seoul Tower which made for a great photo opportunity, but other than that I would not recommend this as a must-do when visiting Seoul. Heck, when we got there we just sat on a rock under shade for about 30 minutes pretending to soak in the serenity and beauty of the area, when in reality our foot was sore and probably blistering."
"Interesting, cultural",The background was really great for photos and it was interesting to see how the Koreans lived long time ago.
A Quick Visit to the Past in the Heart of Seoul.,"I walked to this village from Chungmuro Station. Seeing how much of a metropolis Seoul is, places like this will bring us to the past. The traditional architecture and art of Korea can be seen here, well preserved and maintained. It's right there, just amongst the tall buildings. Visitors can go for a walk around the village, learn hangeul, play traditional games and try on hanboks. At one of the houses there, traditional hanboks can be rented at less than KRW6000.00, a great bargain compared to other places I've read/found out that charges more. The lady who was in charge of the hanbok rental was very kind. Noticing that I came there as a solo visitor, she helped me took my photos like it was a photoshoot almost everywhere in the house :D The signage there had English translations. The village is a huge area, I wish I I had spent more time there. There's free public wifi in some areas in the village."
"Very cute, great landscapes in the background","The Namsangol village is a reconstitution of what a traditional Korean village was during the Joseon dinasty. As a reconstitution it feels a bit like a tourist attraction (it certainly is), rather than an actual historically relevant and authentic place. Nethertheless, the village is very interesting. It is free, big enough to stroll around for 2 hours or so, and allows visitor to discover the different buildings and rooms comprised in a Korean home and village. The place is very-well maintained, and doesn't feel dated at all. What's also great about the village isn't the village itself but the background and the surrounding environment. Located at the foot of Namsan mountain, the village is allows for stunning views of the mountain as well as the Jongro skyline. In and around the village, the park is also very relaxing: patches of grass, river streams, trees, pagodas, pools, combined with the actual village, make the place truly worth seeing. Lying around for 30 minutes or so in the park is actually probably the best thing you could do in the park, as it is truly relaxing."
"Good place to take pictures, and it was free","It's free, what else could I say? The place was not too big, but you can see Namsan tower clearly from there. There are few old houses, and good place to take pictures, especially for couples."
Interesting and free!,"A collection of traditional Korean homesteads have been brought from across Korea and sited here at the foot of the Seoul 'jungle'. This was a stop off on our Hop on Hop off bus tour (which is rubbish by the way) and a worthy one.Surprised such a place is free to get in, but it is so enjoy! To me a lot of the homes all look the same and we spent only about 40 mins here as we were on a tight schedule but would recommend at least an hour.Some great photos to be taken and activities going on to keep everyone of all ages interested."
Cute village!,Go early in the morning to avoid the crowd! It was very relaxing to visit this place in the morning. It's a very well preserved village.
well presented traditional houses from the past,"Within a short walk from Chungmuro Subway (exit 3 or 4) this ""village"" is well worth a visit. Various traditional style houses are displayed in a well planned park with some water flows nicely landscaped. Good place to stroll around leisurely, taking in some historical background of Korean life. There are periodic guided tours in different languages. According to the brochure I picked up the park is closed every Tuesday and if Tuesday happens to be a holiday, next day too. Other days the park opens by 9am and closes at 9pm (8pm during winter months). One can easily spend anything from 2 to 4 hours depending how much you want to take in. There is also a Korean traditional medicine clinic within the park where you are invited for a cup of Korean tea and a free health check. In approximately 30 minutes or so young ladies/men, dressed in traditional and colourful costume, will take some information about your physical health, take some readings (with the help of modern aids) and take you to the traditional doctor for a quick review. The doctor will explain what is best for your health and leave you, if required, with a small dose of traditional medicine for the next two days. Everything is free and there is no hidden agenda. Well done! Korea."
Beautiful Hanok Village!,Visited this hanok village with my mother. Beautiful traditional hanok houses and lovelyb cherry blossom trees here really makes our trip here meaningful. You can try the traditional hanbok clothes and take pictures with the standees. 
Cultural experience,Admission is free. Good cultural experience where u get to know how the traditional people lives in Korea. Can wear Korea Traditional Clothes and take pictures
Traditional village,"This is a traditional korean village created in the middle of Seoul's skyscrapers. Admission is free. You get the sense of how a typical family (nobleman, craftsman,...) lived in these compounds as they are furnished and maintained in excellent condition. In addition, they offer demonstrations of traditional arts (basket weaving, calligraphy, trying traditional dress, martial arts). It's also very calm and peaceful with many trees and areas to sit. At the top of the hill, there is building with a millennial time capsule which will be opened in another 400 or so years. "
