A day out with my Chaplain,"I took one of the Osan AB, Chaplain's , her assistant and a friend to the museum. It was great. I am from New York so hearing the Godfather music and seeing Al Pacino, and Robert De Niro sitting down was a huge surprise and great experience. Also the room with the Presidents was priceless. There were even exhibits of Kings and the Pope. I especially enjoyed seeing Chinese National riding a Horse next to Napoleon. You can even ride a bicycle next to ET! I have not smiled and laughed as much in years."
Cool Wax Museum,"It was a warm day in Seoul on our day to visit the Palaces. We had a list of places to go to with our BTS edition of Discover Seoul Pass. This was one of the places to go to. It was cool and the place was full of figures of people we know, especially our Korean idols and famous leaders of the world.We took our time going from floor to floor and there were also other guests from our country, the Philippines. What was great about the place is that it was not just a museum of wax figures, they also had games and 3D figures you can have photo ops with. They also had a souvenir shop where we bought stuff of our idols ( G Dragon, LMH and KSH) It was a good afternoon for me and my son. We enjoyed it. We have been to a wax museum in HK but this was great because of our Kdrama and Kpop idols. Thanks Grevin Seoul, we had fun . Thanks too for sending souvenir photos through my email."
Meet the Stars,Conveniently located near City Hall Subway station. It was easy to find. An opportunity to meet with many movie stars around the world.especially the Korean movie stars. An interesting wax museum...there were also digital games that you can play inside.
Fun museum,"I liked the Grevin museum, it was my first wax figures museum and I was really impressed with how real some of the statues looked. I had fun with Einstein and Steve Jobs at the pop quiz room and I enjoyed making photos with other celebrities like Al Pacino, Brad Pitt, Messi and the Queen. The museum has a section with only k-drama stars and k-pop artist and overall it was a fun day. "
Great ,"If you have spare time, this is a good option. The place was pretty much empty when we were there & we received 20% discount with our MasterCard. "
Wax museum,"Interesting museum to visit. However, the Asian stars doesn't look as realistic. We had fun playing with the interactive games though."
Good stuff to do when in the city,Good place to spend an evening in Seoul. Some cool things to see and do here. Not a place to go multiple times
Very good,"We went there on Monday and I was surprised there was literally no other visitors but us. Around 4-5 people arrived later. Except taking photos you can also participate in some games at the museum which was kind of fun I think. They take your pics and send it to you via email later on. Also, the regular ticket price was 18kWon but you can get 10% discount if you pay with MasterCard."
Very entertaining wax museum ,"Worthwhile visit. You can go through the process of making your sculpture, makeup, costume and finally, taking picture. "
Interesting,"Like any wax museum, some figures look very realistic and some not. They also have some interactive activities for guests to participate so make sure you have more time to spend inside."
K-PoP Stars,"Free admission with the Seoul Pass. I only spent an hour snapping pictures with K-POP stars, Trump, Obama, etc political leaders around the world"
Great experience,"We went first thing in the morning on a weekday. Got in free with the Discover Seoul Pass. No queues, in fact only one other couple there in front of us and they quickly lost us.Great experience "
Grevin Museum- Seoul,So you won’t find much mention of this place among the top attractions in Seoul. However I think it’s definitely worth the visit if you have time to spare. They have quite a few games/ interactions so it keeps you entertained rather than just walking around the wax figures.
Great wax museum and rainy day activity,"The Grevin Museum is pretty well known so we were very enthusiastic about visiting it. As it happened, it was raining so visiting it was the perfect activity. Firstly, the pace is huge, so wear comfortable walking shoes.We took the lift to the top floor and worked our way through each level and at each floor walked down steps to the next level.Most of the wax figures were very recognizable and the great things about this museum is that you are allowed to interact with many of the figures for taking photos as well as there being many other ways of interacting. This ensured that our children had a great time.Whilst most of the wax figures were easily recognizable, some were less so, or at least less recognizable or exaggerated in their features such as the figure of Brad Pitt which was almost not recognizable in my opinion, and also the wax statue of Lady Diana which I felt was not so good.However, the whole family did thoroughly enjoy the museum and we must have spent at least two hours inside.The museum is well located in the city centre and being very close to City Hall and across the road from the Lotto department store and Duty Free shop."
Grevin- Wax Museum,Really nice place to take pictures. I think that this is funny when you come in and you feel like the wax people are real people or that real people is wax people. I don’t think so that this is type of museum that you have to go there. But if you have free time pr it’s rainy day you can go there.
Great Experience Not To Be Missed,"Visited Grevin Museum ( Part of Discover Seoul Pass Free Entry) and found this to be the best valued attraction among their list of 21 free attractions. Apart from the realistic Wax Figures, there were also some Trick Art Photo opportunities as well and some interactive games which you could play too. Overall a very interesting Museum. If you are looking for directions, you should download a local map navigation app called Naver and search for Geurebaeng Museum . It will give you options to take either Bus, Metro, Taxi or Walking routes with estimated travel times and cost as well. "
Must see museum,"For me, it was the most interesting and funny museum which I have ever visited. Was confusing live people with their exhibits "
Korean's Version of Wax Museum,"You can take pictures with live size famous people including Korean stars here. Interestingly, there are interactive stuff like piloting a plane so the whole experience wasn't just for picture moments."
Interactive Games,"The tickets for this place was part of the Discover Seoul pass.I thought that this place was just a wax museum and was pleasantly surprised when it was a bit more than that. Keep your entrance ticket handy since that's what you use to play the mini games inside. Like other wax museums, you can pose with the actors for photo ops. Some of the displays or areas had games like roulette and landing (or in my case crashing) a plane. I thought that made it more interesting.Some of the wax statues were a bit hard to tell or unfamiliar but there were placards around so that you can figure out who you're looking at. Nice place to spend some time especially if you can recognise them all."
Good enough to spend a couple of hours,Positives: we came in the afternoon and there were no crowds. We practically had the entire place to ourselves.Also there were a few interactive game exhibits where u can either play solo or with a friend.Negatives:There wasn't that many exibhits (only 3 floors) and some of them don't really look like the real person.I can't imagine spending more than 1-1.5 hours here. You can probably go though the entire place within 1 hour. 
Great museum,"I am used to always doing the wax museum, which is usually always Madame Thussaud, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it is a museum Grevin in Korea. I was there with my little brother, there was almost no one who made the visit very pleasant. We were able to really take our time and laugh a lot. to see the stars of Kpop and Kdrama is really nice, especially for the fans."
Interactive Visit,I booked the ticket through a travel app(Klook). I think I was charged less than lining up. It was a trip i need to fill in the gap between my departure time from incheon. I have about 7 hours before my flight and from the time I checked out. It was fun. The characters are interesting. Some familiar some not but still worth the trip.
If you wanna see your idols!,"We came in late at this place, like just one hour they weill close so we had to do everything in a rush, but it was a nice tour! It was 4floors full of waxes, just something quite disappointing though was the Lee Min Ho wax, he didn't look like him or any close to him, but the rest were fine especially G-DRAGON! There is also a shop there for you to shop all those Lee Min Hoo, BIGBANG and JGS goodies!"
Celebrity Sightings,"Celebrity sightings...well, in 'wax'. Fun to walk about life-like statues of historic and contemporary celebrities. It's a quick visit."
Just a great place! ,The best way to be close from your idols had a lot of fun with my family and we took hilarious pictures! 
Nice place to visit,I enjoyed going to Grevin. The wax figures were very well done and there was a lot to see. They were divided up by theme rooms. I wish I would have went with someone. I could only take selfies which was hard. I recommend taking a friend if you want to take pictures with the figures. I also liked the interactive exhibits.
Best Wax Museum I've visited ,"It is definitely not the biggest (see MT), but delightfully the funnest wax museum encounter I have hade all over world. We did not intend to go, but given it was across from hotel dropped by, wow. The staging of the scenes adds so much fun, and even though we did not know many of K Celebs, we quickly figured out their significance. If you have visited other wax museums, you have to try this one in Seoul and discover a whole new immersive experience :)"
Nice Detour,We passed by the Grevin on our way back to our hotel. They have celebrities for all ages and lots of interactive games for the young and old. We had a great time with the realistic wax figures. Fun afternoon!
Meet celebs here,"easy to reach from city hall, pretty cheap and fun games inside, also you can take picture with world celebs "
Nice place to visit,went to this place and tour starts at level 4. walked out from the elevator and shocked the atmosphere very quiet with deemed lights and you will see famous statue's. Some of the statue doesnt really look like to the celebrity. I was shocked that day where suddenly a staff was standing next to the statue suddenly moving. haha... i think they should say Welcome to Grevin
Recommend to visit with friends!,I visited with a friend. Will definitely come back again and recommend to friendsTaking ridiculous pictures and I enjoyed interactive games.It was a good time ;)I got a 10% discount on Mastercard!
Great to visit with friends,"My friends wanted to take pictures with G-dragon and korean drama stars so we went there and it turned out to be really fun. Of course for foreign Hallyu fans the experience is mostly attractive because of the korean celebreties, but in reality world stars are just as interesting. The fact that you can become a part of everything is also a plus. So many games and activities, in my opinion a very nice way to spend time with friends and get hundreds of picures. Their gift shop has official goods of korean celebrities which is also quite handy for those who is interested in this kind of thing. I would definitely recommend."
Nice visit at the Grevin museum.,"My visit at the Grevin museum was just as expected. Great wax figures and a lot of fun and pictures.As other Grevin's, you can ""meet"" with great people :)It's nearby City hall and other area of interest, so if you happen to be around, you should definitely stop by. I also received a link to download a snapshot of some of my visit.If you want to see Barack Obama or Leonardo DiCaprio or even Gandhi, this is the right place. Don't forget to say hi to the Pope :)"
"Madamme Tussaud for Seoul, South Korea","We went there since our daughter wanted to see the Korean wax museum up close and personal! Not a bad place to visit. You should get the Discover Seoul Pass if you wanted to visit this museum so that it would be worth the money paid. Lots of wax artists or celebrities to see. We have been to the actual Madamme Tussaud in London so it is nothing compared to the real ones. The only different is you can catch the glimpse of the famous Lee Minho. Overall not a waste but then if you just want to visit the museum & pay the entrance fees of KRW18,000 then it is not worth it!"
Another place to visit in Seoul,"If you are already in the area of the stream, might as well pay a visit to this museum. There is an entrance fee of 18000 won for adult. The wax museum will start at the 4th floor down to the 1st floor. If you are a fan of Korean stars, you can sit beside Lee Min Ho. You can also play the interactive games per area, I tried the simulation game of being a pilot and in order for you to lay the game, you have to scan your ticket code. At the end of the your you will be required to encode your email address so they can send all the pictures you had in the simulator, a wax figure of yourself and a lot more. They also have a 3D Gallery where you can take some pictures while holding the leaning tower, falling in a big hole and having a portrait in the plaza. You can allocate about 3 to 4 hours on this depending on how addicted you are on taking pictures. By the way you can have selfie with the stars and play casino with the ocean’s 11 cast. "
Take your sweet time and have fun at Grevin Museum,"Grevin Museum is composed by four floors. Each room has a theme and with it a matching sound and light system, making the experience all the more realistic and engaging. After you buy your ticket you will be instructed by the staff to take the lift to the top floor and then you move your way down to the beginning area. Always keep your ticket at hand. You will need it to activate the interactive games and activities throughout your visit. You will be able to play the roulette with George Clooney and Brad Pitt, a basketball match with Michael Jordan, attend a class in which Steve Jobs and Einstein will be your teachers, take a photo in Andy's Warhol studio, land the presidential airplane with Leo DiCaprio guidance, learn the process of how to make a wax figure and morph your face with one of your favourite celebrities in the beauty salon. Some of these activities will give you the possibility to send the end result to your email if you wish to do so.The 4th floor starts with a walk on the red carpet. Prepare yourself for the clapping and paparazzi and to be greeted by Hallyu celebrities. After you indulge them in taking a selfie with you, keep walking. In no time you will find yourself surrounded by Hollywood stars from the Ocean's Thirteen, E.T. and The Godfather among others. On the same floor you will meet Korea's greatest: King Sejong, Saimdang Shin (the first woman to appear in a Korean bank note), Admiral Sun Sin Yi, Yi Hwang and Yi IInventors such Einstein and Leonardo da Vinci and people who dedicated their life to peace and human rights such as Pope Francis, Ghandi and Nelson Mandela are also present.The 3rd floor is composed by world leaders, athletes and artists. It is also where you will be able to land the presidential aeroplane after you scan you ticket and discover the magic behind the wax figures creation, the “Discovery Atelier”.The “Discovery Atelier” is amazing. You will be able to see how those super detailed and life like figures were created. You can even follow the steps that were needed to create G-Dragon (Korea's music idol) wax figure to create your own 3D model throughout their activities. While there, you will learn that it takes months to create a wax figure, that they all have natural hair, eyes made of glass and that their teeth are created by a dental specialist. Some of the wax figures are dressed in clothes donated by their models from their own wardrobe. On the 2nd floor you will find famous actresses, world renowned fashionistas and the Hall of Fame, which is also the main hall of Grevin Museum and where you will find Psy, G-Dragon, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Mike Jagger to name a few.From then on you move to the recording studio where you will meet John Lennon, Luciano Pavarotti and Sumi Jo.The visit ends on a K-Drama set titled “Hallyuwood”surrounded by some of the most famous Hallyu actors and actress like Lee Min Ho, Park Shin Hye and Hyun Bin.If you have kids, do not worry. They will not be bored since they can interact with the wax figures and also participate in the activities. Mine loved the aeroplane simulator, the 3D creation of herself, to ride a bike alongside E.T., play a basketball game with Michael Jordan and try the quiz given by Steve Jobs and Einstein. Actually she loved everything. The problem was to leave the museum.Grevin Museum is open all year round. Has a gift shop and a Cafe.Its at walking distance from the City Hall if you are farther than that take the subway. The stop is Euljiro 1-ga, Exit 1 ( follow the sidewalk for about 3 minutes. The museum will be on your right side)Make sure you take your camera with you ready for action. Once you get in you will become a happy trigger kind of photographer."
It was a good time:),"Frankly I've never been Myungdong before and had no idea where to go. However, I've been often told Grevin is one of the best wax museum out of Asia and was recommended by a good friend of mine who has already been there couple times. There were many figures of celerbrities and other public figures, such as Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. I loved how life-like those figures looked. It was so amazing I couldn't believe that some of them looked wayyy too real. It's worth the cost and fascinating to look at. I highly recommend this lovely wax museum to all of you!"
Worth a visit!,"Grevin Seoul is a very nice place to have fun. If you are in Seoul, make sure to visit this place. I had a really great time!"
First visit,"Nice interactive game.. But some of them not open.. Many korean artist, maybe can add more international artist too. Overall great place to visit"
AMAZING EXPERIENCE,I had great experience exploring the museum. Was able to discover alot and know famous people around the world.. the best part was the last part indeed. Hoping that they can add BTS on the entertainment section so that I can see them on the next visit but overall it was indeed a good experience. 
Grevin museum,"Very entertaining for us and fun as they are not many people's at that time. There have games for us to come with, in addition to the numerous figurines available."
Grevillea Museum ,It was fantastic !! I loved it so much !! Would come back again with other family members or friends !! 
Had a great time ,We had a great time visiting the place and looking around. Definitely must go to place when you visit Seoul. 
Grevin,Our visit in grevin museum is fantastic! Will visit this museum again for sure! The staffs were also accomodating and all the wax figures looked so real
Lovin' Grevin ❤,"It was such a wonderful experience! We were so happy to see G-Dragon, Lee Min Ho, and other Korean artists even if they're just waxes. Will recommend this to other friends planning to go here in SK!#GrevinSeoul"
대박!!!,Such an amazing and wonderful experience. The wax figures are the best! Most especially kpop section. Hopefully i can see more artist and/or personalities on my next trip to trip. I will highly recommend this to my friends and fMilies to include grevin museum on their list. 파이팅!!! 
Grevin Seoul,"i like the kpop section and the plane landing simulator is fun. My favorite artist yoojesuk so funny looking, my fam loved leeminhos sculpture they took 100 pic with him, i wish theres more kpop and artist sculpture. I recomend this to everyone to see this museum, its fun "
Mixing with waxwork celebrities,"A must see in Seoul. Very well done and popular, visiting on a week day would be better as it attracts large crowds. Well laid out with a large array of waxworks done by a French company. Children and teenagers were laughing and enjoying the people depicted."
 5 stars!!! ,It was really fun! The museum was very interactive. There are so many themes and each one of them is unique. Our family had the best day here in Grevin museum. I hope to come back soon! :) 
Awesome ,"This is a bravo place for whole family ,Nice place to take picture and some mini game experience ,is suitable for all age .Highly recommended if you visit Korea."
This place was bravo,I like this place very much. This place was a good place to took nice pictures with famous people and experience a lot of real live game...
Great,"It’s amazing !!! I think the Korean star and the singer inside is the best. And you can also find some famous people inside the museum. Like the president, movie star, and some sports man. For my opinion, I think there should be more Korean star in this museum."
good,"門票不便宜，但內容很多元，可以拍照玩樂，大約1-2小時，it's a really good place to spend time at here, maybe in the future, it will have more machine to play with."
Museum Visit,I had an awesome time in the museum! The figures were all very well done and there were many activities to do. The sets were well done with music adding to the environment in each room. Well worth the visit!
Interesting trip,"Was hoping for more wax figures of kpop and kdrama celebrities. When I visited alone, there were only 2 other visitors. During the initial phase of the visit, a staff was tasked to follow me around, supposedly to guide me on the rules, etc. However, at one point, when I turned around to look for her, she was nowhere found in sight - she had left without informing me, leaving me alone, surrounded by the wax figures; that really crept me out. It wasn't until a while later when I ran into the other 2 visitors when the ambiance became a lot more pleasant. But overall, it was interesting, and I was glad that I visited."
Helicopter Employees...,"Employees kept following me around for almost the entire duration I spent there. It made it really awkward to take photos... If I moved to one side of the room, they slowly walked over, and if I looked at the employees, then they would casually glance elsewhere. Smh, I wasn't going to destroy their museum or take dirty photos. Just a foreigner trying to enjoy the museum like everyone else is. Employees are creepier than the wax figures."
Excellent place for wax figures,It's 3 floors of wax figures and all of them looked realistic with really good favial expressions. Worth checking out if you have more time in the city! 
Such an interesting experience,"It was nice to see the museum. Really liked the part of airplane section. Also, you can have various experiences just by scanning your ticket in each sections"
Grevin Seoul ,"Fun and interactive games that keep our energy going . Have a great time with my family. Will definitely come back again and recommend to friends, colleagues and relatives ."
So much fun!,"We're travelling in Seoul with 2 kids and their grandmom. We really made it a point to put Grevin in our itinerary cause of it's really cool wax figures. Not also that, but the kids loved the interactive games/ activities in the museum. We had so much fun! "
好特别,"第一次去蜡像馆，很好的经验，不错的museum，我李敏镐也好帅哦First time visit Grevin museum , good experience , wonderful inside . All of the actors/ actresses are so real!! Highly recommended "
Come to grevin museum!! ,Fun wax museum where you get to take pictures with celebrities. Will recommend to come here when you're in Korea 
Great Visit,"A great place to take friends and your family to see your favourite celebrities!!! If you’re looking to do something after a nice day of shopping in the shopping district definitely make a trip here, you won’t regret it."
Vacation,"Some of the wax figures looks so real, i really enjoyed the games tat were being designed:) I hope that the directions provided will be more precise & exact:) Staffs were being very helpful too"
Great overall,Awesome pubic figures made out of wax! And the staffs here are extremely nice to talk to! I highly recommend others to visit this place :)
Nice place,"It’s 3 floors museum, with kind staff. Variety of celebrities. Nice souvenirs shop in the end. There is restaurant with nice sitting. "
The wife getssquimish about wax museums,"Yeah, the wife thinks they might just come to life and jump out at her. She is frightened easily. We happened across this place. It is multi-level, but after about an hour and 2 floors, we wanted to leave. It's not that bad. We were just tired. You'd probably spend about 90 minutes here on average. Some of the wax figures are really well done and some are just not done well. But there is a great variety and some things are interactive and worth some cool photos.I was not busy when we there in the middle of the week."
Cool,"Chanced upon this place through a tour. Cool wax figures across all 4 levels, comes with a lot of interactive activities. Con is that you have to keep holding your ticket as it is needed to scan your ticket if you wish to proceed with the interactive activities."
Lots of photo opportunity!,"This wax museum have several locations in the world.... Paris, Montreal, Prague and Seoul. The only one in Asia! The wax figures mixed with American & European celebrities with Korean famous celebrities, total eighty stars.Several floors of exhibition. Remember to fully charged your phone/camera, lots of photo opportunities. Absolutely fun place to check it out~ The Hours: 9:30-19:00The Subway: Subway Line 1 - City Hall Station exit 5Subway Line 2 - Euljiro 1-ga Station exit 1"
Fun to visit! ,We spent around an hour inside. Place contains 4 floors so there is much to see. If you have a MasterCard they offer a 10% discount. Highly recommend to visit. 
Museum ,It was really good the activity along the statu but I wished there were more korean celebrities but overall was enjoyable 
A beautiful muséum!,Very Nice museum with lots of fun stuff To do. I recommend. Its very cheap. And peuple are friendly.
Three stories of fun,They have a number of interactive games. We especially enjoyed the flight simulator. The museum is very close to the metro station and is only a few minute walks. 
Awesome wax figures,The figures were very realistic and I loved how each room had a different theme. Me & my husband really enjoyed our visit!
Love it so much!,"I came here with a friend because we saw an advertisement on TV. We spend 2 hours in the museum and didn't even realize - the time went by so quick! Great sculptures, lovely arranged, many picture possibilities and games to play. I liked the wax figures here much more than at Madame Tussaud's in Amsterdam! I'll definitely come back here! Best day of my holiday so far :-)"
Interesting,"Enjoyed looking at the realistic wax figures of famous people, although mostly K-pop fans would better appreciate this."
Interactive,Barcode scanner system with the interactive activities are enjoyable. Some of the machines only offered Japanese and Korean though
Awesome,Must visit great place to enjoy urself with ur friends or solo ! A lot of celebrities and fun things to do also you can play games it s really fun
Museum good,Nice place. So many actor I founded. Staff very good. Sarangheyo❤ I will introduce to my friends....
Leaning more towards like,"So for most places, you either love or hate them but I just like this place. Don't get me wrong, it's fun, educational and simply amazing but some of the wax figures got me going ""huh??"" Especially the Hollywood actors but all in all amazing with interactive games. You can also make your own wax sculpture"
It's worth to see,My first time to see wax museum here in South Korea. They have great figures. I would recommend you all to come here..
Intriguing place,"Interesting museum, lot of local Korean artists and some International figures. Hopefully next will add more figures."
Fun place,It's a really fun place with lots of games and famous people statue in it. I really enjoyed my time here
A must visit near city hall!,Grevin is located near Starbucks near the City Hall station On line 1. I did not expect the museum to have such a huge variety of wax statues of famous people from around the world. What took me by surprise was seeing Meryl Streep's statue here. It's a must visit if you're eager to see statues of your favourite kdrama and kpop actors / singers.The souvenir shop is really good btw :)))
Awesome!,A great stop for tourist to have a picture with local and international celebrities and personalities! Must see!
Grevin Seoul,"Very interesting museum. It has different variety of artists and at different era. Great experience, try it too."
Fun wax,The Grevin is so amazing!!! I want to go back here again to have more pictures! All of my group had fan and its really realistic wax copy of the celebrities!
Awesome!,Amazing detail. Fun games! Will go back soon! I will bring my family. Will also tell friends to go when they are in Seoul!
Very nice place!,Very nice place with cool virtual simulation. I recommend everyone to go to this place if you have extra time in Seoul.
Fun interactive games and impressive wax figures,"The wax figures look really real, especially Michael Jackson's and Park Shin Hye's! The games were fun and easy to play. Definitely recommend this to anyone coming to Seoul, especially in this hot summer!"
Awesome time!!,I was walking down the street and walked in because I've never been to a wax museum before and I loved it.
Good,Very nice museum. I love it very much and want to come back soon. I loved the Lee Min Ho and Yu Jae Seok figures especially.
Real Deal,The museum presented a wide variety of celebrities with varied theme. Every floor is a sight to behold. The figures look very real and there are some fun games too where you can participate. The souvenir shop also has a good selection of items. Staff are very attentive to your needs.
Museum is interesting ,"Here is a good place to visit and we like it very much, meanwhile you can take a lot of pictures with famous people."
Must go in Korea! ,I really like the place! Must go in Korea! Add more Lee Min Hoo! Worth it the price! The statue looks so really!!!!! 
Make Good Memories,It's nice place visit alone or with friends. This museum has many famous people.People who like taking pictures would be great place for them. Also if we pay with MasterCard we can get a 15% discount.
Great,Its a nice museum and all the employees are nice. It beautiful place and i enjoy this place have fun ...
好玩,I would like to compliment the staffs from Grevin Seoul to search around my binoculars which has left behind somewhere during my visit on 10.11.16. And thanks to the local tour guide Ricky to help to collect it after a few days. Such a friendly and nice people from Korea. This was my 3rd time visit Korea. I definately will visit again ! ^^
Daebak,I loved this museum was funny seeing a wax figure of the queen. This museum is cool and loved it especially getting to see wax figure of gdragon 
Hansung 2017 Tour,"I went here with my school. This place is amazing to go to if you are in Seoul, I highly recommend it. The wax sculptures are freaky when you first see them, but they are great to use to lie to your friends about meeting celebrities! But seriously though, go here. You won't regret it."
Grevin museum moments,I've had wonderful moments here with lots of images of celebrities in the world and in Korean as well. Great! Worth visiting!
Great one ,"Well I recommend it , this is the only thing I've had with my discovery Seoul pass , my toddler likes it but not fully enjoyed it "
Awesome Experience ,We visited this place as part of the Discover Seoul Pass and it certainly did not disappoint. There were a lot of things to do from playing basketball to landing a commercial plane! 
Seoul 2017,"This place was great! Even though we're not from Korea, there were plenty of celebrities there we recognized, plus a whole bunch of fun, interactive activities to keep every age level engaged. A must-do."
Hallyu Idol Sighting,"I enjoyed this museum particularly for a hallyu fan like me, since there are lots of kdrama actors inside the museum. I was able to have my picture taken beside them. Layout of the museum is good and there are interactive machines inside."
Great Museum especially for Hallyu fans!,I am psyched to meet my favorite Korean stars in this Museum. They do have US president's statue and some international stars & celebrities. But they are commonly found in other wax museums. More additions to the K-Pop collections are recommended even though I am happiest to meet with Lee Min Ho & Park Shin Hye in this place...
Wax Museum,"First time going to a wax museum. Entrance fee is 18,000 KRW. Lot famous people figures. Close to City Hall "
Can visit ,"Can visit the museum if you are in this vicinity. There are a few wax figures of singers, actors and sports player. "
Quite entertaining...,We finished it in about an hour but the interesting thing about this place compared to the other wax museum I've been to in sydney is that they have lots of interactive activities to do in comparison 
Great wax museum with a little taste of trickeye fun ,This was my first wax museum experience after being very resistant to try it. The sculptures were amazing and the little bits of history in the museum was very cool. Fun little activities of which some were far better than other.
With son,It was very exciting to see all the stars in the world. I never knew that looks awesome. I strongly recommend this place. 
The most entertaining Wax Museum,"This is the biggest Asia wax museum, there are 14 main theme sections and 7 games activities in it. You will meet up with 80 famous icons in the world. It just opened in July 2015 and is a very high quality wax museum and worth the entrance ticket of 46,000KRW."
