It was nice!!!!,"There were so many people, so it is best to go early. I went in the evening, as I just want to stand and watch the fireworks from the stairs. You can eat many street food here, and also can rent a bike to ride before the firework show start. The firework show was okay, I can't remember if they play music during the show or not??? The one in Busan, I remembered they play music while the fireworks sparks in the night sky. Anyways, it's nice to see the show----but don't expect too much."
International fireworks display Seoul ,"Fantastic family entertainment, long waiting periods in between the daytime fireworks (bring an umbrella to avoid the ash hitting you) and night time 1. Entertainment throughout the day and a DJ set at night. Very entertaining"
my first time in seoul,it was my first time that I ever been to Seoul and started with this firework it was amazing but the weather was a little cold and I did not bring any warm clothes. I suggest it to all who wanna have an amazing night there but do not focus on taking the picture just enjoy the moments and instead u can download its pic from the net.
Big bada boom!,"This may have been the most amazing fireworks show I've ever seen. Canada's show was just OK (sorry Canada!), but Spain's was great and Korea's-- I didn't know where to look, there was so much going on at once!!Great food and tons of cheap ballooons/glowsticks and junk your kids will beg you for. Super crowded, so if you want a riverfront seat get in early. It's worth it!"
Fireworks Festival,"This festival be held at Yeouido. This is the best fireworks in Seoul because the fireworks are synchronized with screens, music, and lasers. So many people or tourists came to Yeouido to see this festival. "
The big and the best fireworks festival in Seoul,"You must visit this fireworks festival because it's so wonderful, amazing, and beautiful. For me, this is the best experience in Seoul. More than a million people gather at Yeouido to see this performance. Don't miss your opportunity!"
And the party goes boom,"This isn't just another fireworks festival. In fact, it is one that you should really come and experience for yourself.The Seoul International Fireworks Festival usually takes place around early October, but the date changes every year, so do search it up on Google to find out the exact date.I strongly recommend attending this festival because you are sure to enjoy it and have a lot of fun. The fireworks display is amazing as it is spectacular, and there are even some sequences where the fireworks are released according to the music that is played in the background. You'll love it.The atmosphere is really lively too. The Koreans are the bunch who will cheer as the fireworks light up the sky, and that makes it really fun as everyone is just in the mood and enjoying the display.Even though the opening ceremony officially starts at 7pm, do head down to Yeouido Hanging Park as early as 4pm to get a good spot in the park. If you don't have a picnic mat or food to eat, don't worry, as there will be people selling these items nearby and inside the park. I do recommend getting fried chicken and cola to enjoy while waiting or enjoying the fireworks display - it is great picnic food.To get to the park, take exit 4 of Yeouinaru Station (Seoul Subway Line 5)."
