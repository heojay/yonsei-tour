Incredible design - great instagram shoots,The design is breathtaking - and very massive. The surrounding areas offer a lot of cool shopping and eating spots.
Photographic Place,"This area is one of the best place to shop but this time, we went here to enjoy the cold weather and take lots of pictures here! Truly a wonderful place for photography"
Calm and Modern,I stopped by at the DDP at nighttime with some friends and it was a great visit. The architectural design of the plaza itself is so unique and definitely worth some photos. I believe they tend to have some exhibits are art programs here sometimes but you'll have to check out their website. There is a History Museum that you can check out as well with free admission. 
Impressive Building,"This is a very beautiful building, spanning multiple blocks in Seoul. Its architecture is unique and outstanding from every perspective. There are pianos in various locations, free to play. Around the back there is an upscale street clothing market."
Futuristic design,The building is very attractive in design. There are spaces for exchibitions in the building. There are art shops and restaurants as well
Great Spot and Marvellous building ,What an amazing building!! The little shops in DDP were really interesting and worth exploring. Spend a lot of time in there. Glad that interior is not overly clutter but kept clean and minimalistic. The outside was full of activities so it was worth a trip both inside and out. 
Looks beautiful from the outside but didn't really get the point of it,Was looking forward to coming here but after marvelling at the structure and sculptures outside we were a bit bemused by the inside. We only managed to find a cafe and then a huge hall which was empty except for a couple of Mormon brothers having a rest. Not sure what the point of the place is.
Wonderful Place,It is a wonderful place to visit. Great architecture and atmosphere. They have different exhibitions. 
Best seen at night,"This is a fascinating building which looks great from pretty much any angle. There didn’t seem to be an awful lot to do there - a small shopping arcade & a gallery for exhibitions plus some historic remains in the grounds with a small museum - but we spent an hour or so there, then went and ate in the arcades nearby then came back once it was dark when it looked even better. It reflects the light from surrounding buildings & looks quite otherworldly. Well worth a brief visit."
Architectural Delight,"As an architecture buff, I found this plaza in Seoul to feature one of the most innovative modern structures that I have seen. I first visited the 7-level (4 above ground and 3 below) building during the day and was so impressed that I returned to introduce the center to my husband that night. Designed by architect Zaha Hadid, the futuristic construction exhibits no straight lines or right angles. Instead, it presents elongated, curvy forms, built with concrete and cloaked in 45,000 aluminum panels.At night, the center’s lights seem to glow from within. At certain exterior vantage points, its shape and silvery hue give the impression of what I imagine a giant spaceship to look like. The park next to the building further enhances the look. It holds 25,550 LED roses, which light up 5 minutes after sunset and are absolutely stunning. It was a magical experience to stroll here in the dark. Inside, the curves continue in long corridors and connecting stairways (there are also standard elevators). The center serves as a fairly new venue for design in Seoul, featuring an art hall, meeting space, a museum, a design lab and a design market. I visited the huge lab, which displays a variety of well-crafted items for sale and gives visitors the opportunity to meet the designers. We enjoyed a light dinner in one of the many eateries in the market, which is connected to the nearby Dongdaemun shopping centers.DDP, located in Downtown Seoul, is easily reached by subway. Take Line 2, 4 or 5 to Dongdaemun History and Culture Park Station and leave through exits 1 or 10."
Fluid design,"We visited here as a nice walk in the evening. don't miss this work of art on the beautiful architecture. there are so many great things about this building. obviously curvy outside is amazing. The interior and exterior, both are inspiring."
Stunning,"I loved the outside of this structure with its sinuous metal shape winding around gardens and walkways and couldn't wait to explore further. It is beautiful and whatever is going on inside, the building itself is worth a visit. There were two exhibitions on when I visited which were both quite interesting but didn't really float my boat - but that's subjective, they were very well presented and worth the time I spent there. Take time to explore the building, the nooks and crannies and little architectural surprises are a joy to discover."
Interesting structure,Visited this place after recommended from local. The design of the building is very unique especially in the night. Do visit this place if in Seoul.
Curvy and I like it!,"Glad to be a witness of Zaha Hadid’s work in Seoul, all the curves and the details that house all the creative spaces in the complex such as museums, galleries, multi-purpose halls, markets and restaurants, such eye candies."
Great architecture ,Went here with my fiance and its amazing. The structure of the building is impressive. The way they left a piece of history in the middle is great and I love the 2 statues as well. If you get hungry there are a few different places to eat. Definitely going to go back next year.
Modern,Very nice to go even on a rainyday. Seoul showing off their modern arquitecture you can take nice pictures and visit Kako friends shop without the crowd.
Breathtaking architecture,"As walk out of the Dongdaemun metro station, a huge metal clad curved building takes your breath away. It's the Dongdaemun Heritage and Cultural Plaza designed by world famous architect Zaha Hadid the 'Queen of Curve' (2007-2013).The building blends into the historic landscape of the old Seoul City Wall at the point where the river used to run under the wall there is the aptly named Water Gate - with a timber grill to bar entry.The Plaza has sinuous paths to mirror the sinuous building. Inside there is a museum, and the Cafe de Fressina. A visit to the cafe is a must - it is in a huge cavern, with the flooring, the furnishings and the stunning serving counter designed by Zaha Hadid. Have a coffee and cake / snack.Walk around a while and take back your breath.See my photos."
A masterpiece of Architecture in Seoul,"This impressive modern building desgined by the prestigious architect Zaha Hadid is the hube of the huge square. Theres is a design museum inside that you can visit. Sorrounding the metal structure of the building you can visit the restored remains of the ancient fortress. There is also a small, but exquisit, museum dedicated to the old stadium that was demolished to build the square that you can contemplate today. The area is plenty of markets, shops, restaurants,..."
Great Area,"This is such a great area to visit! Great architecture and lots to do here! Shopping, outdoor markets, food, buildings! Their buildings are absolutely amazing!"
Spectacular architecture,"This building is truly spectacular, and definitely worth a visit. There is a design museum and design exhibits to see. There is also plenty of shopping and dining opportunities around the plaza."
Impressive Zaha Hadid Architecture,"We admire ZH jewels, this is one with rounded forms. Could spend hours there.Actual exhibition Paul Smith fashion designer. "
Interesting if you are already in the area.,"Not worth a visit on its own, but really cool architecture and a photo op. If there, be sure to visit the free Stadium Museum next door commemorating the old sports complex (build by the Japanese) that was demolished to DDP."
Impressive art,Impressive art in the building. It suit the city scenarios very well not disturbing at all.Inside also it could be a surprise.
Urban landmark...,"with a neo-futuristic design. Located in the center of South Korea's fashion hub.Multiple levels, 5 halls. The filming location of a couple of different dramas. Opened for conferences, exhibitions and various events. There is park on the roof."
It's like Star Trek Enterprise,When I came there it seemed like I was in a space ship. The whole building looks like a futuristic vessel. It's very nice. There was a exhibition about urban development and the entry was free. I don't know if it was free because of Korean Thanksgiving or if it's free on other days as well.
Beautiful Art ,Such a beautiful place to take picture. The building design are unique and beautiful. You can enter the underground and enjoy your shopping. 
Very professional,"Exhibitions are well set and have lots of works present. Not to mention the building itself, which is sick!"
My favorite place in Seoul,"I love this area! It’s such a treat for my eyes every time I see DDP. Such a beautiful architectural design that has to be seen in person as photos don’t do it justice. Also the shopping here is very good, the business hours of the shopping centers is staggered so it offers shopping pretty much 24 hours. I prefer this area over Myeongdong, although it’s also crowded it’s more “open” with the shopping centers vs outdoor shopping streets. "
for architecture lovers,"Just walking around and experiencing the innovative space, new views opening up, was interesting. The stores + museums (Disney) inside were of the boring mall variety."
Very Impressive Building,Very Impressive with the architecture by the late zaha hadid. There's a cafe inside and some shops underground. 
High level Architectural design,"Beautiful place where to spend a night. There are some kiosks for street food, shops, people all around and a pleasant atmosphere.The Design of the entire area is just amazing!"
World Class Architecture,"This place simply has to be seen to be appreciated. The design is on a large staggering scale and surprises when compared to the many tiny alleyways that are in surrounding neighbourhoods. The fashion malls in the area are unbelievable in terms of number of shops, selection and pricing. "
 Beautiful place ,"Very beautiful, lots of English signs and explanation. Good for photography walking. We got the opportunity to see Seoul metro station "
Shop and Shop,"Seoul - a city of 24 hour fried chicken, beer and shoju with ladies shopping non stop till 5 am in 8-9 Stories malls of shops including basement shopping. Important note to Seoul :- Come with empty luggage as you don’t need clothes, masks or cosmetics ! You can shop till you are broke. Always bring cash in Won or $$. Tips for shopaholic: - Remember you can always go back to hotel to shower and re-consider that dress and go back to the mall at 3 am to buy and then celebrate the great achievements of full luggage and extra luggage and then have a late supper of fried chicken with beer after.Most important- Download Naver map as Google map don’t work in Seoul !"
Interesting visit!,Loved the architecture and the shops inside the exhibition area! Bought quite a few interesting things there like a bookmark inspired by the DDP architecture and rlly good leather card holder. We did not plan to specifically visit this place but it turned out to be so pleasant!
Good lunch stop,"My hotel was close to this unusual collection of buildings so we took time to explore, including the design exhibition.I found the architecture a bit too 'brutalist' but some will like it.The archaeological diggings in the centre of the buildings were interesting, with bi-lingual signage.We found a Vietnamese restaurant chain outlet inside so inexpensively lunched at that.The below ground Metro station is one of Seoul's busiest and quite a labyrinth, but if confused, just ask a younger local as many now speak English and are exceedingly helpful."
Smooth design,Cool place but nothing special other than the building itself. Stores and restaurants inside is like any other typical shopping area. A place to stopby while you shop and dongdaemun. 
"Design building is beautiful, but not much else.","The building itself is wonderful but full of wasted space. You walk around expecting something great but it never comes. The shops around the area are a waste of time, selling knock-offs and cheap local style ""aji-ma"" style clothing. "
Spectacular Building,"Interesting building but inside there was a huge hall with many unusual chairs which I suppose were interesting but not particularly inspiring. The interior is worn and in need of renovation, all in all it seemed like a bit of a white elephant"
"Modern architecture, a place that integrates the community",Amazing architecture - the work of Zaha Hadid. Interestingly arranged interiors - from the design galery to the shopping center. Worth a visit.
Worth to visit,"Here you can easily spend lot of time, impressive place also from outside and inside. Loved ""furniture exhibition"" where you see and can try design chairs all over from the world."
Korea war cease 27.7,A fantastic ceremony to honour those who gave their lives in the Korean War. The main hall was filled with people.
Beautiful design,Some interactive design fun with chairs and pianos. This will either be a nice rest stop as there are tons of seating options inside and some lay down options outside or an enjoyable hangout spot if you enjoy design and art. Possibly a great place to get high quality gifts.
Exotic and cool place to visit,The plaza architect is stunning and exotic. It's really cool experience to walk through the buildings. There are some cherry blossom at the back of the plaza. (early April)
Superb,I really like it here. They had some pianos laying around so I got to play them. I like the idea of entertaining fellow visitors :)This doesn't have the LED rose since it's an exhibition that ended a long time ago (sad). But we got to walk around and appreciate the buildings in the night.I know that they over some exhibition at the halls but for God's sake this place is huge. We just had like 30 minutes to go around the area so I really want to go back and visit this place again!
Cool building,"Cool building outside and in, located in the centre of Dongdaemun with the large shopping plazas, can come in to have a look around. "
Futuristic Seoul,"I really love the DDP - first of all its exterior design is so pleasing to my eyes. It’s curvy and fluid and just super cool. In the evening when it’s lights go on, it really looks like a spaceship out of Star Trek. I enjoy walking around its many corners adoring them over and over again. The inside is as cool as the outside. With interesting exhibitions, stores, and the most interesting stairs this place is really worth checking out and especially if you are into design, style, architecture and space."
The iconic building for Seoul Fashion Week!,"This building has a very cool architecture style and for those who love photography, you can also have a photo hunting day here in DDP."
Urban Photoscape,This place is good start for people who are still beginner in understanding minimalist art and urban landscape. The unique thing about this museum in my opinion that it is the pioneer of art sharing which is seen globally in terms of minimalist and urban art.
Stunning building,A very stunning building. Every corner of this building is a very good photo spot. Also don't forget to take photos at 'I Seoul U' sign while you are here.
Impressive & unique architecture,"This plaza stands out in Dongdaemun area, with its large and unique design building. It is used to host various exhibitions, fashion shows, conferences etc. The building consists of the Art Hall, Museum, Design Laboratory, Oullim Square and Dongdaemun History & Culture Park. Just behind the plaza is a small and quiet park, with many free seats with umbrella covers."
Beautiful Architecture,I wasn't actually able to explore the place due to lack of time but I happened to pass by and took a selfie. I am awed by its spaceship-like design. I heard this is a shopping place for designer clothes and shoes so I think prices here are more expensive compared to those shopping streets like Myeong-dong. 
I like the design of the building ,I like the design of the building - inside and outside. There is coffee area as well. Love the design! 
great space good exhibitions,this design plaza is a sleek soft metal building with surrounding galleries shops & restaurants which is all very interesting and fun for the entire family! there is also the river close by below ground level to explore or picnic‼️
Stunning architectural masterpiece ,"Dongdaemun Design Plaza’s curvy and wave structure catches my eye in a neighbourhood of straight, boxy office buildings. Without the signages you would not know where is the entrance to the building.We walked around the DPP on a late afternoon to appreciate its exterior. Each different angle gives you a fresh perspective of the building. We didn’t visit any of the indoor exhibitions. There are shops, cafe and restaurants in the basement, and street artists who could do a quick portrait for you.The DDP is directly connected to a subway station. I’ll recommend a visit in the early evening."
Architectural delight,One can't miss this delightful building when in the area -- but the delightful exterior far exceeds the utilitarian interior.
Lots of Things to See,"If you are a designer or has likes to see various creative work then this is an area you should visit while in Seoul. There are a lot of shops, exhibits, activities that you can visit and experience. Coffee shops, food shops, etc..are available as this is locatedon top of a subway train station (Dongdaemum History & Culture Park)"
Personally like to visit here. Good for who are interest in designing or any events ,"Good place to visit, chill and can be a nice place to explore. Recommend for people who interest in any event or designs. Flee market and food trucks available sometimes. Nice and creative architecture. Place to visit for designs and creative goods seeking. Temporary events rotate periodically. As time of my visit, there are many interesting events such as Hello Paul Smith and The Art of Disney The Magic of Animation. Flee market and food trucks in the evening as well. More spaces to walk around and chill out. Easy to access with many public transportations.Idea to visit if you have spare time. "
Tourist destination if you are in the vicinity,"If you happen to pass by this attraction, go ahead and give it a visit. You will be marvelled by the design/structure of this building. It seems to be a convention area for special events. The time we went there were several food and retail carts along the garden area. The adjoining underpass had shops to check out. Overall a good place to hang out and chill after a long day."
Special Curvy Building,"This building was full of curves and flowing lines that made it one of the coolest buildings we visited. Inside an almost all white walkway spiraled up to the top floor making for a long walk along the outer circumference of DDP. A staircase with an oddly angled and brown contrasting steps brought us back down.The building and surrounding areas were open 24 hours a day. I walked around for free inside but to visit any of the exhibits or museums you just had to pay an admission fee (roughly W16000 for adults). On the ground floor was a temporary exhibit on Disney animation which seemed to be quite popular. There also was a Disney store and lots of silkscreened animation scenes from the likes of Frozen, Big Hero 6, and Moana. On the second floor was an art museum. On the third floor was a children’s play area, some collaboration space and on the roof, a viewing area and a cafe. In the back was a lush landscaped area with seating, a piano and various art pieces. In the front was a large courtyard where lots of people were congregated.My daughter previously visited during the nighttime and enjoyed seeing the building lit up. We will have to visit again."
Beautiful Structure,The way its made it's super unique and beautiful. Situated in the biggest shopping district of Seoul. This area is surrounded by malls. Must visit to click some great pictures
Artsy architecture ,Dongdaemun Design Plaza’s architecture is amazing..great sight with several shopping centers nearby.
Huge space for exhibitions,"Glad that we saw this on-going Disney exhibition from 2019.4.19 to 2019.8.18. Really nice to relive the childhood memories and learnt more about how Disney actually evolves through the years. :-)Tickets are @ 15,000 KRW for an adult.There's another area with cafes and shops. Else just take a seat outdoor and enjoy the breeze.We saw the LED rose at night too!"
Extraordinary contemporary architecture,"Don't miss a visit to the DDP if you want to get away from temples for a while and see an ultra-modern side of Seoul. Aside from the architecture, the centre has other attractions, and shops. When I visited there was a Disney Animation exhibition. Definitely worth seeing. Oh, and if you play the piano, there are several dotted around the complex. Just sit down and play!"
Look like a scifi spaceship,The building designed by the wellknown late Zaha Hadid looks like a scifi spaceship landed in the middle of the city aurrounded by shopping malls. It looks amazing and walking in it feels like inside something surreal. Every corner is curved giving the feeling of endless boundary without borders. Really very interesting design concept and realization.
It’s okay,"I may have selected the wrong time to visit so take that into account. First, if you enjoy architecture, the building itself is so unique and beautiful that you can’t go wrong. The building, the artistic statues outside (perhaps the correct term would be sculptures?) are definitely worth seeing in person. The interior is peaceful and calm which contradicts what you might anticipate looking at the space age like exterior. However, there wasn’t a lot going on inside during my particular visit. If you have young kids, they would have fun on I believe it was the third or possibly fourth floor."
Awesome,Beautiful structure. I was so amazed how it was done. You have to see it for yourself. One of the best place I have visited in South Korea. Superb 
Great View!!,"I came shopping here around Dongdaemun area, and came upon this beautiful design plaza. It is a great picture opportunity, and you can sit or drink and eat around here. They have places for you to sit, and just chill. This plaza is just right behind the station. It is convenient and nice to get to."
Nice,Nice place for photo shoot. There are a lot of points for photo. Sometime has show or exhibition there. 
Of Curves and Elongated Structures,"First time to visit DDP and was impressed with its design. It’s like an infinity elongated curve from start to end. It would be nice if you could see the plaza in its total structure as it is quite unique and futuristic. We were there late afternoon and when it got dark, the lights gave the plaza an awsome ambience. They have this attraction which we visited and waited for hours the so-called led rose garden where hundreds or thousands of roses automatically light up as the sun sets. It was a nice view as the night went deeper. There are also have art hall, museum, design lab, design market, culture and history park but most of them were closed when we were there. It’s quite tiring if you tour around the big plaza but there are coffee shops and restaurants where you can eat and rest. It’s good to visit this place."
Flowing emptiness,"I do love design so, I was really looking forward to my visit to the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP). Having dragged my family to it, I must say, I was --- disappointed.Yes, amidst Seoul’s skyline, the DDP’s facade is aesthetically unique for it’s fluid lines and steel curvatures. There is no doubt, its sheer outline exudes design.But once, we appreciated the swooping façade and geometries, there is just emptiness inside the building: empty rooms, empty echoey corridors and vast empty spaces. For a designer, space is a design element but when we went (around 4 pm on April 17) there were no exhibits, no permanent showcase not even, food trucks. Just one big EMPTY building.OK, if you are a modern architecture design nut (and enjoy photographing shapes) but, you might want to skip this if you have mixed group. For a showcase design plaza, they really could have done more with it."
Dongdaemon Design Plaza,Dongdaemon Design Plaza has a modern architecture. It's about 19 mins walk from train station. It's a must visit place.
Shopping District,Ideally for teenagers that love shopping as some of the shops operate till 3am late night and lots branded is on sales ;)
Very Big,"When we visited, it was really cold, but there were still so many people around. There weren't that many food stalls opened as we had hoped for, but there was a piano there that we enjoyed playing."
Great place to visit at night.,Its good to see in the daylight but more spectacular at night with all the LED flowers all light up too.There is a cafe inside..Looks like a huge spaceship with its many windows.lots of photo opportunities.The steps leading out of the area are also light up.
Amazing view outside,If you like architecture and are interested in design you definitely should take at least a walk around this spacious building. You can also go to the design exhibition. 
"Better on Day, Better at Night",A huge design of greatness with glimpse of city’s history and culture. Went there to watch the rose lights but arrived before dark. Amazed. Bejeweled. Enchanted. Must see!
Check before you go,"We aren't only to find out there were no exhibits. Literally zero things to look at inside. It's a nice enough building, but we were expecting to see actual design work inside, only to discover they were between exhibits, have no permanent collections, and most people went for the market out front and the children's playland on the top floor. It was very disappointing. Would highly recommend finding out if there's actually something to look at before you go, else just stop by if it's on your way to someplace else. Not worth it to go to Dongdaemun just to look at an empty building."
Modern Seoul,"Generally Seoul has not fine architecturel profile.. but this DDP is well aesthetic huge building.. I experienced and felt touching, watching, listening a functional sculpture..a little bit in some where of the DDP I lost or confused about the horizon.. I advice at least two hours to spent in there.."
Beautiful architecture. Food and art fair,We went in the evening. There was a food and art fair when we were there. A live musical performance as well. Food trucks were available and the local youth were spending their evening enjoying the good food and music. 
Fashion Week,We stumbled upon DDP after exiting from the subway station. It was very crowded at that time as it was Seoul Fashion Week. There were many fashionable people dressed up and posing for photographers. Very interesting to watch. And of course the exterior design by renowned Zaha Hadid is something to look out for. 
Tour,"Spectacular 3D architecture design! Impressive concept! Worth a visit. Beautiful from inside & outside for photos. There was a change of new lease for the shops, so we didn’t get to see many shops on that day. Shops were being refurbished. "
Don't miss it,"Besides the great amazing architecture, the thousands of LED rose flowers art exhibition also one of the most romance attraction at Design Plaza, it will close on 30-04-19, don't miss it at night time together with you lover, so romantic for photo taking."
Visit to DDP,"Easy access to this wonderful sight to behold. One of Zaha Hadids final master pieces. I visited unknowingly on the anniversary of her death of 31.03, 3 years ago and you can see the reason she was famous. It’s an architectural piece of art for the ages. I am stunned looking at the curves of the building and then to find out it’s mostly usable space was incredible. I thought it would be simply design, but it’s functional which makes it doubly amazing. I absolutely loved every aspect of the building and the exhibits. Another South Korean architectural marvel."
Amazing architecture and good place for shopping,"I love this beautiful place and there are so many good place for shopping around here. One of my friend studying in Korea, she said there's good place for gift and suvenir shop around here. It was small shop naems 'Gwanghui Pharmacy'. They sell various health supplement for skin. When I went there, there were so many asian tourists from other countries. I bought some product for skin and constipation. Those were really easy to bring and quite delicious. I recommend you guys to visit that shop if you guys are around DDP."
"High-end, state-of-the-art district in Seoul","Fashion district and the design of the buildings were very modern and state-of-the-art, indeed! There were also nearby malls and night market. "
Amazing architcture,This is the worlds largest 3D atypical structure. The architecture is amazing. It has beautiful graceful curves. The whole structure is column free. At night time it is lit up and is really pretty. 
Unbelievable design ,The design plaza is so unique with futuristic exterior. Inside it likes a maze. Without direction information it’s hard to find the right way. Somehow busy due to the fashion week.
Cool place,I think this place is a worthwhile place to visit while in Seoul. The building is nothing like I’ve seen before. Easy access via subway
Modern Engineering Marvel- Perfect Date Spot,"If you’re into modern infrastructure, engineering, construction, or art muesuem, you must visit Dongdaemun Design Plaza. This place is perfect for couples or families of all ages. This destination is a futuristic multi-use facility that serves as a museum, shopping center, café, holds public community events, and is connected to the train system. It’s best to visit at night so you could view the beautiful artificial flowers that light-up. The vibe here is very relaxing as people could be found everywhere socializing and being present in the moment."
Interesting ,"I didn’t go inside, and suspect that it is even more impressive at night, but it is impressive to be sure. You can exit the subway station directly to it. "
Easy to Get To and Many Nice Exhibits,Wonderful park to spend an afternoon. Lots of things to see and close to the famous fashion center. Connected by metro and located near many restaurants. 
Check it out at night!,Use Exit 10 to check out the front of DDP illuminated at night.Then walk a long its corridors and admire the changing lights of the structure.
Dangdaemun Design Plaza - Innovative technological building,"Designed by world renowned architect, Zaha Hadid, DDP is the world’s largest atypical architecture. The DDP is comprised of five halls: Art Hall, Museum, Design Lab, Design Market, and Dongdaemun History and Culture Park. The Art Hall is the primary launch pad for the Korean creative industry."
Really Beautiful Building inside and outside,The building alone is worth the time and then there is so much more going on - I took a couple of hours looking around - it is very organic form and I was really interested in the planting scheme as well. Lovely that there were pianos dotted around for anyone to play when i was there and the very nice restaurants inside too.
Metallic Shape,"Very nice place, took a picture of it and check in to Facebook! Alot of people as well so it's nice.Other than that, nothing much"
Very interesting place for photo taking ,"The architectural design is very unique by following the contour of the surroundings. The thousand led flower lighting was mesmerising in the evening and is great for photography!In addition to near metro station, there are nice shops and restaurants there as well."
Spectacular construction designed by Zaha and the best instagram place in Seoul,"Located in a Seoul-style block, dongdaemun design plaza is a extremely strange but spectacular construction. Just like zaha always did, she made DDP the an unusual construction and a representation of dongdaemun or even the whole Seoul.I always like zaha’s design and think it very cool to take photo here. You can take very instergrammable photos inside or outside the building since the the Zaha style is everywhere here.If you hope to take some pure architecture photos, I would recommend you to come the eighth floor of lotte FITIN which is a shopping mall facing to DDP. There are lots of clean windows allowing you to take amazing photos of DDP at night. In contrast, there are some buildings nearby where you can not take satisfying photos for its dirty windows and terrible views."
Spectacular construction both inside and outside,This is a must see building in Dongdaemun. It looks like a space ship at night with glistering lights all around. The inside is white with curves and angles on the stairways that are pleasing to the eyes. There was an art exhibition on the ground floor and interesting design items for sale when I was there in the beginining of Feburary. There are two cafeterias that I can see on the top floor. They even have a piano outside around the middle entrance under cover for passerbys to display their talents. You can easily spend half a day there if you are into art and design.
DDP,"Nice building, there are various shops / restaurants/ galleries inside. I took the chance to visit a korean art exposition. It is a good way to spend a couple hours"
Photostop,We went DDP for photostop only. I think we just need 1 hour to explore this place. There are some foodtrucks in December 2018. 
Wonderful building but best at night time,"Located in Dondaemun, and very close to our hotel, this was a really interesting place to visit for all the family. The building is truly stunning and the design resembles something from the future or like an extra-terrestrial space ship. You can wander around the outside, underneath and inside and the different views of the building continually surprise.Inside there were many things happening. There is a huge and fantastic play area for children, an exhibition of Wallace & Grommit, many shops and restaurants and cultural and art displays. Even the stairways in the building are far from normal and cleverly designed.Probably the best time to visit is in the evening time and at night when the building comes to life with subtly placed lights so it even more resembles a flying saucer or space ship.During our visit in the evening time, there were stands outdoors where people were selling handcrafted items such as jewellery, singers and musicians performing, and food trucks from the Seoul Bamdokkaebi Night Market offering all kinds of really delicious local and foreign snacks and street food."
Stunning architecture ,"I find the night view of this beautiful and serene amongst the hustle and bustle of the city. It's a modern walk thru the garden where you will find lit roses and standalone pianos to be played by any passers by (which can be heard from most parts of the spot). In the day you can do more with the design labs, art halls and others alike."
Unique Shape for a Plaza,Mnet Music Awards 2018 was done here! There are free entrance in some areas for exhibits and garden. It is located near shopping malls and very convenient to go to because of nearby train station.
Nice especially night fall,Nice lighting around the area. The week that we went there they are having the mama awards but unfortunately we did not see any celebrity. Overall the building is nice.
Stunning place,"This museum is both stunning yet totally accessible in terms of bringing good design to all echelons of public and taste. It is also situated in a fantastic area of shopping, architecture and leisure. Allow several hours to visit the area or stay in one of many nearby hotels."
Beautiful design,"I visited DDP at night. Beautiful building and lights. If you're here, be sure not to miss the LED rose garden."
RIP Zaha Hadid ,"So glad I got to see this building. Also Love the shop inside. If you are an architect, this is a must place to visit in Seoul. "
Great for Christmas shopping ,"Unusual and unique gifts all under one roof! We bought baby socks, a big hexagonal dish, a foldable backpack, a watch and K-pop paraphernalia. We had fun checking out the wares that were on display.Tired and hungry? Perk-me-up treats are available at the AID cafe. Scones, sandwiches cake and coffees and teas. They were excellent. "
We were there at night!,"What are pleasant surprise, so many lights were light up and the view is nice. This building with super modern look!"
Great Architecture,the architecture is amazing. best time to visit is evening so that you can see the lights & reflections over the huge building. there are some exhibition halls inside the building. an iconic land mark of Seoul. highly recommended.
Nice design,Beautiful building. Attached with the subway that link to main station. Nearby shopping area and restaurants. Didnt get ti catch a show there because we didi not plan to. But indeed it is a beautiful building to admire.
Beautiful Architecture,To be able to conceive such a beautiful building and making it a reality is awesome. Must visit the LED Rose garden at Noght
The architecture was stunning enough,"Went there with the intent to explore any design exhibitions. In the end, plans were mired by the architecture and Kakao store. The architecture was fascinating enough to capture even a layman's eyes. At ever angle near the building, it was stunning to see it especially closer to sunset. Spent some time taking photos of the building. Even more fascinating was how the building was not so obtrusive that it was rude to the environment. It remained modestly unobtrusive, retaining the harmony and yet feature it's avant-garde intent.For families, they can pop by the Kakao shop for photo opportunities with the cute figurines there. Shopping is welcomed there too.The basement has F&B outlets and shops. The building is conveniently connected to the Dongdaemun History & Culture Park."
Art museum void if art. ,"It’s a beautiful building and you should visit if you are a champion of significant architecture. If you love art, you will be shattered with disappointment. There is no art here. Changing exhibitions means that all galleries were closed. Buildings designed to be galleries have been turned into job fairs, malls and food courts. It’s pathetic that a civic project has been allowed to be so misaligned with the original intent. "
"Great Architecture, confusing space",The architecture is stunning but the usage of the space is a bit confusing (seems to be more of an exhibition hall than a museum) so if you want to see the interior find an event or you will be limited to the hallways and public spaces.That being said I strongly recommend a visit (the entrance stairway alone is worth the visit in my opinion) and the archaeological area at the base is very interesting
Nice architecture,"Apart from the unique architecture, there isn't much to do here. Wouldn't recommend coming all the way for this. "
Great place to buy gifts,This is a great place to shop for unique gifts and souvenirs. We did the majority of our Christmas shopping here. 
japanese ramen,"you must try this branch of Aori japanese ramen. the soup broth is so thick and yummy. the sliced pork doesn’t smell and it was so soft, it melted in my mouth. the noodle was not soft or over cooked and it still had a good bite to it. i ate here in 2 consecutive days. you have to ask for their english menu"
Impressive!,"We were not aware if there was any exhibit going on the time. We came at night and did not explore much, but it was already awesome."
Ruin days n closed every Monday,Remember : on Monday they closed!!! No one told me even this TripAdvisor that DDP is closed every Monday... we took far away travel to DDP from Gangnam-gu after myeongdong by train but when we are here is closed... only design market is open... lost our time!!!
Beautiful and futuristic,"Dongdaemun design plaza designed by Zaha Hadid is beautiful and futuristic with curvaceous forms. There is artwork exhibited, a cafe and much more. I enjoyed walking around it and admiring the beatiful forms. There are also other stores and restaurants in the surrounding area. "
Pretty cool landmark to go see! ,It’s a pretty awesome looking building to go see! It’s also where all the shopping malls are so it’s worth it to go see and the light up white roses are just outside! 
Great Design,"I visited Dongdaemun Design Plaza when I when to visit the Dongdaemun Market. It is nearby and you have to visit this place to enjoy its unique architecture. It is a major cultural complex and host events such as Korean Fashion Week and so on. But if not for those shows, you just visit the place to appreciate its unique design and architecture."
First time in Seoul!,"The design of the building is unique and there’s spiral staircase within. First floor showcases designer clothes, bags. There’s a design museum. It is basically a place that shows designers’ stuff."
Appreciate the Design and the Art,"It's a must see, appreciate the design of the building and come at night so you can see the different lighting fixtures. Also don't forget to see the LED rose garden. "
Fantastic Building,"Unfortunately we missed this as it doesnt open until 10.00 which is when we had to leave we were only in Soeul for 23 hours so did the night market and missed this as our hotel hadnt mentioned it. was so near The building is stunning shame we didnt get the full experience, check the opening timings if your going as it changes weedays/weekends"
Elegant Modern example of Hadid design,"Fantastic structure on the edge of the inner city of Seoul in the bustling markets of Dongdaemun. Located on the site of the old baseball stadium the DDP represents a unique piece of building which looks like a huge sculpture in the classic curvy design of Zaha Hadid. Carefully built using BIM modelling the building contains galleries, shops and public areas inside and outside for just viewing and enjoying the atmosphere. The building has lots of secretes and is worth a tour. In December 2018 there will be a display of fine jewelry from the famous jewelry house of Switzerland. Definitely worth a look ! "
DDP!,Dongdaemun Design Plaza is a well known architecture and unique structure in Seoul. Better be here and be amaze!
Beautiful at dusk,"We visited just after sunset, around dusk. The lights came on shortly after we arrived. Fantastic building, it's great to be able to wander around & view it from all angles. Really beautiful, so glad we visited."
Average but beautiful architecture ,"When around late afternoon, you cannot miss that landmark. Got a mix feeling about the place.... got shops and quite confusing for me. The lights display/design has dimmed (when I was there) and not as impressive as initially thoughts but still acceptable view at night. Use your imagination and photo app ;-)"
Golden hour - best time to take pictures at DDP,"Visited this iconic architectural site on 26 October 2018 about 5 PM, it’s the perfect time to take pictures only a couple hours before sunset, we still have natural light, shadow was softer, the angles and length more vibrant. The view was breath-taking."
beautiful architecture ,DDP is a landmark that can’t be missed in Dongdaemun. Check the design shops and museum in the building for interesting design items. There was a street play by a young group about plastic pollution and a Halloween-themed food truck lane. DDP is more beautiful at night. 
beautiful ,"ddp has an amazing architecture, quiet interesting ... Walking was quiet cool and we had a wonderful time , perfect weather when we went there last october... "
Mixed feelings,"Only visited during the day. Some people say here that it looks great at night. Im sure it would. They pulled down a huge baseball complex to build this amazing shell of a building on this site. Its great looking on the outside, but its the opposite of the Tardis. Big on the outside, virtually nothing on the inside. A couple of unattended sad sort of museums ( with boxes etc just lying around) , a small shopping centre and a train station entry. Must have cost a bomb. Nice curvy lines yes, practical/ useful - not at all. Underutilised. An opportunity lost ( a concert hall it should have been or just a modern stadium etc ) and I love modern architecture, but only if it is functional."
"Zaha Hadid WOW, I loved it what a magic!","It is a rare opportunity to visit the Master Architect of the world, Zaha Hadid. Walk inside and outside and enjoy this rare piece of art, Magnificent and FREE! "
"post modern design, a pleasing sight to the eyes","I didn't have any expectation going there, but it smacked me right in the face I am glad we went there. it fulfils its role as design centre, there are museum, halls, marketplace for budding artists and also shopping/eating centre in one place, making it a one-stop destination for everyone. you can definitely have great pictures in the building's premise, just find angles that you like. favorite photo spot is the stairs. "
Under a space ship ,"We purposely went there to see the landscape and the building, modern and we were like walking under a space ship hoping to meet some aliens there. Don't miss the LED Rose garden. Did not went for shopping there."
A Spaceship Landed in Seoul,"This beautiful curvilinear building and artwork is an oxymoron to historical and cultural park. We only had time to walk the west side of the building and browse the arty design themed shops in the south part of the building. There are interesting pieces to buy in these shops. It’s a worthwhile visit on its own, or if some of your party prefers shopping for clothes at the malls across the street and you don’t."
Beautiful modern architecture.,"After seeing Korea's traditional houses, Dondaemun's design plaza shows the other side of Korea. The place is best viewed at night to see how the lights on the building facade highlights its modern design/architecture."
Great photography opportunity,South Koreans joke about how this place looks like a spaceship. There's not much to see in the inside if there are no events like the Seoul Fashion Show. It is the outside that will be fun for most of tourists. You'll get nice Instagram photos here. 
Space age,This was very near my hotel and it was really impressive at night. The building was lit up and looked very modern. There was so much to do around the building. Highly recommended.
A different feel of Seoul,"Try visiting when they hold the evening markets. The whole place is amazingly designed (hence the name) and some of the galleries and exhibits are definitely good.Even the stairways are nicely designed, not forgetting the lightings.a good 1hr walk, even when your aim was to shop at DDM "
Awesome area to hangout at night,The building is beautiful and an amazing work of art. The walkways and overhanging beams make for great photos. There's many small boutiques inside that sell some of the most unique gifts and home decor I've ever seen! The top floor has a green-space and restaurant. Great area for just walking around.
Interesting architecture but otherwise not much to do,"We went to see this at the end of our trip; the design museum was closed (not sure why.) There’s a nice gift shop inside with handcrafted items by Korean artists which are reasonable and better quality (bought some earrings.). Ended up at a shopping area (Lotte) across the street which was standard fare (most of the clothing had no prices on them, a little odd.)"
Cool!,"Checked out Dongdaemun Design Plaza at night. Cool to see it all lit up! Close to a market. Had someone playing the piano, and a neat LED flower garden."
Led garden,"We visited the place at night to look at the Led garden, It was beautiful. It is quite easy to find the Led garden. It was quite impressive."
Stunning architecture,"This Zaha Hadid-designed building is absolutely stunning, both inside and out and is a must see if you are interested in architecture. Photos don’t do it justice as it is such a vast space from up close. Inside there is a large exhibition space featuring young designers which is great for browsing for gifts. Outside it is a short walk through the park to the shopping area of Dongdaemun. "
Landmark destination!,"Come over to experience one of the last great architectural masterpieces by Zaha Hadid. It will not disappoint. She quickly understood that Seoul is defined by its seven rings of mountains. Resembling a blobby mountainscape, you can walk on top of the complex and see the mountains yourself. Come at about dusk. The night illumination of this building is stunning. Inside, one of the ""wings"" has a great collection of design stores that is easy to walk through and enjoyable to browse. The other ""wings"" have changing exhibitions and shows. Incredibly easy to get to as it is connected to the subway. Don't forget the world famous GwangJang Open Market featured on travel shows worldwide for the cheapest and best eats. Take a stroll along the Cheonggye Cheon Canal to get away from the city."
Zaha Hadid's architecture,We arrived just before sunset & had the chance to see the transformation of this piece of art with the day & night time. An absolute gem in the Centre of Seoul. Worth going to appreciate the beauty created by an amazing artist.
Awesome design!,It was fun in there and the epic designs of structures are superb! Definitely an instagram-worthy place! Spend the afternoon there while waiting for our flight back to our country and it was the right decision!
Spectacular at night,Visited the DDP at night and it was so beautiful. The architectural beauty of Zaha Hadid's design is accentuated at night with lights to wonderful effect. Didn't enter the building rather enjoyed the building and sculptures from outside. Definitely worth a look.
Absolute,Beautiful. Hard to find the entrance. Great outdoor space as well. The area has shopping and food. Make sure to look for the rose garden. 
Summer vocation,"Great location,and everything looks new, suitable for girls' stay. Easy going to all major points with metro or taxi, and many good food choices around. Definitely will choose it again."
Great architecture,Place has a peculiar architecture and an interesting one. The exhibits are also informative. Lets you learn about the Korean culture as well as culture of others. 
Beautiful piece of architecture ,We were lucky that this beautiful piece of architecture was located almost next to our hotel. This place is really amazing. Walked around for one hour and took pictures from every direction. The forms are just amazing. It also stores a museum and some shops. Opposite the famous shopping buildings Lotte and APM wholesale. 
Modern architecture,"I think most people come here to see the unique architecture. But if you like art, go inside. Many shops there sell novelties and artsy things "
SUNSET VISIT,"it’s better to visit DDP at sunset, so you can enjoy a breathtaking view from the building and enjoy the vibrant walking areas. "
Very futuristic,"This building is definitely one-of-a-kind in Seoul with its neo-futuristic design and massive perimeter (kind of looks like a UFO, IMO). Best visited at night when all of its lights are switched on. Tip: For foodies like myself, there is an awesome food court at Doota Mall (opposite DDP), Basement 1. Worth a visit!"
Peter G,"Sculptures were fascinating and architecture amazing, definitely worth a walk around and spend some time relaxing with a coffee"
Interesting building,The Design Plaza is an interesting building and if you are in the neigbourhood you should drop by. Wheter it's worth a major detour depend on what's on display. 
Beautiful to look at from afar,"It is better to view this from a distance so you can appreciate the whole architecture. But once inside, there is not much to do. "
Extraordinary,"It is a very interesting building, especially for someone who loves to take architecture pictures ! There is a small russian district nearby."
Pleasantly surprised,"I'm not much into artworks but my sister really wanted to go so we headed over. From the outside it is stunning, with a couple of lovely statues, and inside is pretty cool too - though not as much to see as I thought there would be. A few of the areas were pretty enjoyable to look at, and I enjoyed the design plaza with all the different shops - lots of cute little items for sale."
Amazing building,The building itself is great...especially if you like architecture photography. The shops downstairs are nothing special. but as its close to Dongdeamun Market its certainly worth a look around.
Always something new!,"While staying in Dongdaedum, visited DDP many times. Loved the Farmer's Market, the LED flowers at night,and the design shops full of interesting and innovative products. Such an interesting building and the space around it."
Amazing piece of architecture!,"If you are walking around the Dongdaemun area in Seoul City and all of a sudden you notice a piece of architecture that looks like a spaceship. Don't worry Seoul City is not about to suffer an alien invasion, don't you dare to run, what you actually have to do is to go inside that magnificent piece of architecture and let the fantastic futuristic concept and vision of the famous Iraqui-British architect Zaha Hadid to gravitate towards you, so you can experience a different state of mind while been there.I've been in Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) several times and every time I go there is always a new experience, I never get bored of that place. There are so many things you can do there, take a look at the art and design galleries, there are also food festivals at night so you can try Korean and western food as well. Inside the building, you will see galleries, souvenirs shops, coffee shops and more.If you have an Instagram profile then you can check the Instagram profile of Dongdaemun Design Plaza and you can see what they have to offer because they upload a schedule of their monthly activities there. I will highly recommend you to go there day and night time as well, so you can appreciate how different the style and feeling of the architecture can be."
A Must- See!,"During my short trip to Seoul, I tried to walk around the city as much as I could and found that stumbling upon the DDP around night was one of the highlights of my time there. It's absolutely stunning, there's ample space to just sit and relax, chat with friends, or take in the sights. Lots of stores as well, including a LINE Friends one that was super interesting to check out and do some souvenir shopping at. Not sure it this would still be here but there were also lots of pop-up pianos that you were welcome to use and created a really awesome atmosphere. Nearby electronic rose garden was also absolutely stunning. Overall, even if you can't stay long, definitely try to stop by the DDP during your time in Seoul."
Dongdaemum Seoul Korea,"Omg, this place you can shop and shop till you drop.... many many kinds of fashion outlets and all the newest fashion are found here..."
Beautiful and Innovative,"a new place to hangout, and very stylish even at night. People are very relaxed and there's night markets every Friday and Saturday. Though not many foods for selection, you won't regret visiting. "
Amazing building - a must for every architecture-fan..... and kid,"We visited the Dongdaemun Design Plaza late in the afternoon after a day of sightseeing as I was interested in seeing the Zaha-Hadid designed building in real life. The building itself is breathtakingly beautiful and equally impressive in my opinion and worth the trip alone. What makes it even better is that there is a very large kids play area on the top floor that provided hours of (air-conditioned) fun for our kids on a very hot day. In a busy city like Seoul that does not have a tremendous amount of activities for kids (note we live in Sydney, Australia so we're very spoilt for choice) this can be an absolute life saver and I don't understand why the play area is not advertised more.If I were to make a top 3 of things to visit in Seoul, the DDP would definitely be in it."
Mangga Dua Korea,"If I say this the same as mangga dua jakarta indonesia. Goods there tend to be expensive. If not join the tour then this place can be missed. But if you join a tour then try touring around the building, you will find Korean street food"
Impressive architecture,Very impressive architecture. Saw the led roses lit up at night. Beautiful. There were stalls selling handmade accessories and essential oils. There were also carts selling food and drinks at night. Prices are quite high tho.
Beautiful Architecture,"The architecture is beautiful and very futuristic looking. There are a bunch of shops inside, The second time I came here (in 2015 I think), there was some type of event going on outside with a stage set up and some music artists were performing. It was no one I recognized and I think they were rehearsing for something later in the day or evening. It definitely seemed like things were still being set up. The subway stops right at the DDP, so it's convenient to get to via subway. You could spend so much time just taking photos outside before even going inside to explore. It's also close to Doota and other shopping areas right across the street so expect to spend a few hours in this area if you want to go shopping."
Very nice architecture,We went there primarily to shop nearby and took a coffee break inside one of the cafes. The structure is really impressive for the architecture and good for photos. It is also a subway stop so it's handy to exit here and look around this shopping neighborhood.
So futuristic,Love how this place offer bazzars and some events. They have some good places to go. My favorite is kakao store^^
Nice,"enjoyed the design and if you go in the evening it is decorated with colorful light, found not much to do."
An Architectural Pleasure,"This is a huge place full of interesting architectural designs. There are some shops indoors; another museum, cool eating/cafe area inside. Lots of great spots for pics. My daughter was there a couple of months ago during Fashion week & said you could see all kinds of ordinary people dressed wild, over the top, & cool during that time around there.- Our favorite part was relaxing outdoors on the big blue lounge beds. You must take your shoes off & then just lay down relax & enjoy the shaded breeze."
Great look outside. Inside is a bit disappointing.,"As many are aware of, the design is the work of the famous Zaha Hadid.Looking very cool with futuristic curvy edges.But, the inside is not impressive. There were just a few events and shops. It felt like a newly built office building.There are some things to have fun, though. I found a free piano to play near the entrance in the middle."
Great place to visit. I saw this place at a glance and fell in love with it;esepecially that great design,"Actually I didn't take many events there. When I was there, there were some special exhibition or shows, but I didn't have enough time, so I can't enjoy them. But I looked around design shops and design museum there, and it was great experience."
Futuristic landmark,"There are so many amazing buildings in Seoul to see, mostly historical palaces, but there's something new and very impressive to see, Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) it is rather futuristic. The DDP is divided into a Design Hall, Art Hall, and Museum Hall, the whole complex is free to the public to visit, we walked through one of the buildings, but got more joy out of walking around outside. The complex was built on the former sight of Dongdaemun Stadium, built by the Japanese in the 1920s during the Japanese occupation. During the process of redevelopment of the sight, relics were found which are now displayed on a large surface under the canopy of the curved roofline. There are many other interesting things to see, do and eat in the area, it's a great part of Seoul to explore."
Interesting Exterior but Not Much Inside,"It’s definitely worth seeing and walking around the exterior of this building but it wasn’t worth paying 10,000 Won to visit the museum inside. There wasn’t much in the museum and it featured some drawings, paintings, and hanboks. There was a gift shop in the museum."
Gorgeous inside and out,"What a fantastic idea. So much creativity to see and on the day we went, there was an African food market. Typical Seoul to always be thought provoking and creative. Great coffee shop inside if you need to shelter from the heat (or cold) too."
Very nice visit,Visited the Van Cleef & Arpels exhibit. Worth the visit ! Very nice outdoor fashion show also. Nice music ! 
Contemporary architectural building,This is the place where Seoul Fashion Week is conducted and it sits near the famous Dongdaemun Shopping Area. The building is contemporarily artsy and most people come here to take pictures on the photogenic spots.
For the architecture + any exhibition of interest to you,"I went to the DPP for the first time a few years ago, checking out its architecture and the galleries inside. It's a must visit for anyone who visits Seoul, in particular if you are interested in architecture and design. Great photo ops both day and night. When I went this time for the exhibition on The Art of Aardman Animations: Wallace and Gromit & Friends, it was pouring. Glad that I already had a detailed look on my last visit. Despite the heavy rain, a trip there to see the exhibition was very worthwhile. The exhibition has already gone to Germany and Australia, and is in Seoul now. Lucky I could catch it here. I am a huge fan of Aardman animations and had a great time viewing the sketches, videos, original sets, with all the details. If you go, note that photo are not allowed except at 4 spots. "
Beautiful design,"Besides the beautiful architecture of the DDP (we have not visited the galleries), the highlight is the LED rose garden which looked so beautiful at night! A must visit when in Seoul! "
Must visit. ,"Very artistic and very big but very interesting. Lots of things happening inside, even if you didn’t want to do anything it’s just nice to be there and enjoy the scenery. Lots of shopping opportunities. Love Seoul. "
Worth it if you like architecture,"The only cool thing about this place is the design of the plaza and the rose led garden so go at night to see it lit up. Shopping is the same as everywhere else. I like Namdaemun market more than Gwangjang market because the street food is better. I'm not a big souvenir shopper so once you see 1 market, they're pretty much the same except for the food variety. If you're tight on time, you can stay in this area and skip Myeongdong and Namdaemun. They're pretty much the same but this area is cleaner and more modern. If street food is more important to you and you're shopping for eyeglasses, Myeongdong and Namdaemun have more street food variety and eyeglasses selections."
go for the architecture,went to dongdaemun and pass by the DDP for a look around wonderful architecture but thats just it.. nothing special inside..
Design only,"The design of the complex is great, but that is all about it. Many empty stores and spaces. Better to be seen than visited."
Amazing architecture in the heart of a shopping district,"No doubt DDP is one of the most interesting sites to see in Seoul. Designed by famed Iranian architect Zaha Hadid, DDP is a fascinating contradiction to the squarish city that is Seoul. To really appreciate the marvel, visitors need to spend at least half a day walking and discover all its nooks and crannies. "
Go in,"As great it is to walk around, you should really go in and check their design stores with some tasty coffee"
Good place to spend an hour or two.,"The name of the place speak for it. It's a very decent plaza to hangout for awhile, all specially created gifts, toys, travel item etc. One of the booth attract me it's the 3D printing, you take pictures surrounded by lotsa camera from 4 direction and the owner can print your photo into 3D form. But a little costly for me. 25CM size cost you 550,000 won."
Enjoy,Nice building and design. Walking distance to dongdaemun shopping district. There is a museum too. Visit if you enjoy design and arts.
Amazing place and very big building!,"Wow. This place amazing and beautiful. It's also the venue conferences, fashion shows, trade shows,.... The museum hall is a harmonious blend of Korean design and globalization. I will be back here when I come back Korea."
Here for the architecture ,This is my first encounter with zaha hadid’s architecture and can finally understand her talents. Every architect who is aspiring to be great should come here to study her work. Architectural documentation does no credit to her. 
"Gorgeous architecture, nothing else.. ","Happy I've seen it, architecture alone is breathtaking. But nothing else. It's just a fancy mall. Come if you want to drop your kids to a playground, come for food trucks and coffee shops, come for cheap memorabilia shopping. You won't find here anything you may not find elsewhere in Seoul's markets. Set your expectations straight, you'll have a great time. Come for design, art, modernism, you'll leave craving for more. "
Beautiful building,"Beautiful building designed by Zaha Hadid. Even though nothing of interest went on inside or around the building for me, it is worth an hour just to look around the building."
Great Architecture ,"I was amazed by this building, seeing all the curves. I am an engineer so i appreciate from its exterior alone. I wonder how they have drawn this. There were nice buildings also within the vicinity so i guess visiting this place is worth it from the shopping plazas around here. There is alao an ancient Seoul city wall under and a LED rose garden which is better seen at night."
"Nice photo ops, particularly at night","Stunning architecture and well worth a look particularly in the evening. For those interested in reasonably priced Korean fashion, its proximity to the Nandaemun fashion malls is an extra plus"
Big beautiful artistic building,"Easily accessible by Dongdaemun History and Culture Metro station. Big and beautiful building, rather unique and artistic design. A great place to walk and take a stroll at in the evening if you are coming to Dongdaemun, lots of shopping and eateries opposite it."
Amazing building!,The design of the building is fabulous! At night it looks amazing. It shows Seoul´s modernity. I recommend to visit it.
Special places in Seoel,"This place is a must to see, The architectuur can you campare with the modern part of Valencia, or the Gugenheim building in Bilbao.In the building you will be surprises buy the rolling lines of the wall’s."
Artsy place for designers,"This is a very artsy place where designers or architects would love it. Even so, do come and take a quick visit before heading over to Dongdaemun for your shopping. There are many exhibits which are quite interesting to see and you can chill at the rooftop grass field."
Aardman (Shawn the sheep) Exhibit,"The design plaza is interesting to visit, with many modern sculptures and exhibits. I went to the Aardman exhibit, displaying many canimated creations such as Shawn the Sheep and Walace and Gromit. They explain the many different aspects that make clay figures into a movie, the final product. The exhibit provides you with original set pieces, drawings, and characters previously used. After you finish at the exhibit, there is a picture taking area where you can pose with you favorite characters of the Aardman studios. The building is interesting, modern, and unique. Would definitely recommend. "
Nice Spot,What I love It s the designThe Main building is so stylishThere is a nice garden around with lot of pleasant sitting areaAll around you ll find department store that open all night long Enjoy
Sanctuary for designers,"I only spent a while here because of time restriction, but if you wait until evening, the food truck will be open for business, and the surrounding will be lit. Inside, there are lots of exhibits and art market. On the top floor, they have a beautiful roof top garden and some restaurants. Definitely an artsy place I would recommend if you love art and design!"
Night market ,It is amazing area for shopping especially at night there is beautiful designs of clothes with good prices 
A place where it brings out the arty talents hidden inside oneself,"A very artistic and modern plaza where local youngsters love to hang around. There are special labs for art students, seminar rooms, auditorium and a library. On certain days, there performance for budding young people to show cast their talents (singing, dancing) as well as flea markets selling their handicrafts from jewelries to caricature. It is situated right opposite the Dongdaemun shopping district. If you happen to be in the area, do take a stroll in the plaza to have the feel of arts."
Expositions and beautiful surroundings,The place itself it’s amazing and the expositions inside are changing constantly and very interesting. We were there for the Fashion week and the location fitting amazingly with the event. One of my favorite places of the area. The surroundings have a lot of cool places to visit too
DPP Seoul,"On first sight this Massive amazing architectural structure looks like a huge space ship. It is designed to host various events domestic and international, launches, fashion shows,,conventions,different performances .Museum is remarkable.Nice shops selling lots of local Korean items , souvenirs ,stationary etcWe had nice steaming hot coffee in one of the many cafes One must visit plaza in day time and evening as it is different . In the evening it has lighting going on and off making different patterns which was a sight to see On first sight It gave an illusion as if some offices were there which were lit. It is surrounded by an open area where people can chill. Some people were skating also This futuristic structure is right opposite the shopping area which is a fashion hub I was impressed and suggest a sure visit"
Unique building ,"It is a nice building, surrounded by malls and restaurants. Good for photo taking but the place itself has nothing much. Perhaps spend an hour or less there, take some photos and move to the shopping malls nearby or find a nice cafe to relax. There is a tour bus station (hop-on, hop-off) nearby, and a metro station right beside."
"Amazing 25,000 LED roses lights","I can't forget the view that welcomed me to this mall, so many LED roses bulbs all aglow! Good thing we went there at night. Plus weather right now is good, spring season, not too cold and not too hot. Plus, I was so ecstatic when I saw the area where my favorite Kpop group performed a dance (Highlight boy band) last year! ❤️ woohoo!!! "
Looks like a huge spaceship landed in Seoul!!!,"At first glance, the DDP looks like a set from a sci-fi movie (more like a giant space ship). The building has a very modern and futuristic design so it makes a very nice background for photos. Don't forget to go to the back for the LED roses which light up at night. There are not too many shops inside the building, though. But there are a lot of stores surrounding the DDP where you can do your shopping. Worth the visit."
Super amazing architecture ,"Upon arriving at the DDP , as soon as I stepped inside I can instantly tell the design was by the famous Zaha Hadid. He buildings are huge and have very unique designs. It is definitely a place for those who love art and architecture or even photography as the building offers a lot of amazing angles to shoot from. The exterior of the building contains a section that has a lot of glass flowers that light up at night. This building is useful during the day for daytime interior visits, and also glamours at night time when the flowers light up !"
Very cool place from outside and around,"Only stopped here because the building looked so cool from outside (my husband and I were on a bus tour). Didn't go inside, but walking around the building is cool enough; cool vibe and great people, lots of food stands around and great architecture, would highly recommend."
Unique building features,The only unique experience here is the building features and the way the path is design. Building is quite big and there is a mini flea market going on the day I was visiting. Thus there are some local product on sales where they promote their products.
The piano matters lol,The only nice thing I saw around this place is the colorful piano. The white roses looks dirty already and even their lights are getting dimmer. Hope they clean or fix them tho. They look better when brighter. You can spend a hour or two here and that's it unless there's an event or something.
Beautiful structure,"In awe of the architectural structure. it's designed by Late Starchitect Zaha Hadid. It's a must visit, mostly for the architecture. Their Archive cafe is also very nice, with really good breads and hot chocolate."
Nice,Interesting art pieces around the plaza. Inside is a museum with special exhibits at times. Right outside is the Seoul City Tour double decker bus which you can buy a ticket for to enjoy sites around the area.
Amazing place to Shop.,"This area is bustling and so lively at night. It is more of a wholesale market where people from all around the globe sell their stuff. The place has a array of shopping malls from luxury brands to locals ones selling souveniers. This is the place to buy local souveniers which are cute and cheap. I have attached the Business card of two such sellers from whom we bought cute Koreans nail clippers, magnets, ceramic items, mirrors and so on. There is also a Zara outlet in one of the mall which sells clothes at very good prices. If you are lucky you can find amazing clothes from Massimo Dutti at never imaginable prices at the same Zara outlet. DDP is a must visit."
Expected something more entertaining,"This is exotic and nice building, for sure. Made several shots of it. But inside... I was expecting something unusual inside as well, however there's only food and shops. Sometimes exhibitions."
Watch PIXAR 30th anniversary,"In this plaza there is a exhibition hall, and fortunately I went there when Pixar had a big event on their 30th anniversary. I had a great time with my kids, watched all the history of Pixar and got more knowledge of how did they made animation movies such like Toy Story, UP, etc"
Beautiful place but not enough signages in English,Impressive place in terms of design but lacks an information counter or signages in English. Good to walk around if you have no agenda.
Exceptional Building,"The Dongdaemun Design Plaza was amazing, i came here in the night and the lights make it more magical to see. Since the mall around here they open 24 hours so this area will be packed by tourist and local who shop."
Amazing,"If you are ever in Seoul and want to enjoy modern architecture, the Dongdaemun Design Plaza is a MUST! "
Amazing building,"This amazing building has to be seen to be appreciated. Go to the top floor and out to see the ""green roof"", walk up and down the stairs, explore the inside. There are many small shops selling design goods and souveniers, and cafes as well."
Easily explored in a couple of hours.,"Not really a big attraction, but it does have dining options and a interesting area for photos at night. The LED rose garden is worth seeing at night without it being too crowded. It is tucked away in the back of the building with stone walls surrounding making for architecturally intriguing photos. When Seoul Fashion Week is held here it is great place for people watching. "
This landmark is very accessible since it is connected to Seoul Subway through,"Their operating hour is Tuesday-Sunday from 10AM to 7PM with extended hours of up to 9PM during Wednesdays and Fridays. This landmark is very accessible since it is connected to Seoul Subway through “Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station”. There are also a lot of shopping malls and duty free shops around the area, including stalls that appeared to turn into a street market at night."
Glowing Night Flowers,"A beautifully constructed building, great place to go at night & take pictures. Coffee shops inside."
Love this Plaza,"I took lots of pictures here. It is so futuristic feel...huge and wide buildings. If you love stationery, there is a Monami concept stall where sells nice quality pens which i feel is a good souvenirs to friends or relatives. Not to mention it is a Korean brand. "
Very impressive new architecture ,"A must see in Seoul, especially at night. Very impressive architecture by late Zaha Hadid, she was an Iraqi-British architect. Looks like an U.F.O. has landed. Has a lot of interesting design shops inside"
Amazing,It's an amazing center of design and market. The architecture looks like a spacecraft and inside you find many shops and restaurants. Don't miss it! 
Love the design of the building ,We walked through a big modern coffee shop gate A3 inside the DDP and out into the led rose light garden which was outdoor .During night time it was brilliant the glowing rose flower lights shine bright and lovely filled the gardens in DDP . 
Picture Perfect,"I can say we were lucky because in our everyday itinerary we need to pass by in Dongdaemun Design Plaza. The modern, amazing architecture is simply picture perfect. We had the opportunity to view this beautiful architectural work both day and night. This is near Dongdaemun shopping district/market. It is worth your time to visit if you happen to be in Seoul."
Post modern design,"If you are into modern design and architecture, this is the place to visit. Designed by the late Zaha Hadid, marvelous building"
Great Modern Architecture,Showcases modern architecture of curves and modern materials. There are art shops inside that features unique designs. There is a pay museum at upper level. You can also relax at garden/open areass around the building. Right across the streets are several shopping malls some at duty free prices.
Come at Night,"There's a rose lampions (?) near the gate and people definetly came here to take a picture with that. it was so beautiful tho. Inside the Plaza we can buy souvenirs, the place was so huuugee and incredible. there's also a lot of restaurants and stores nearby. "
I loved it,"I enjoyed seeing and being there, it was something unusual but interesting and modern, there were many traditional restaurants nearby. "
If you like architecture and design. Stop by!,"Modern space. Good shops and restaurants inside. I tried Aori ramen! They have cubicles for the introverts! I just didn't have much fun because, there are a couple of couples on my left and right who wouldn't stop chatting. The division didn't stop them. But the food was delicious. I will be back this springtime! Yay! "
Interesting to inspect and maybe shop,Very modern and impressively designed and on a subway station and near the Dongdaemun fashion towers and department stores. Modern crafts to buy. A welcome addition to the tourist trail in central Seoul
Interesting architecture,"The out side is in aluminium panels. The interior has wood staircases with a very interestin design. Is different exhibitions. Souvenir shop,rest area. Subway lines 2, 4 or 5 can get ypu there."
"Unusual, modern architecture",Chanced upon this place while visiting a local market. Very impressive structure that is worth a visit in its own right
stunning giant curves building by architect zaha Hadid,"it's a must visit building in South Korea, a masterpiece by zaha Hadid, building without edges...all about the curves, from outside to inside. It has beautiful large park on the site and also roof garden completed with many function in one building, shoppes, museum, etc. it's an honour for me to be there."
Only good if you like shopping,Definitely an area that appeals to people who like shopping. Lots of shops and bargains to be had. Metro nearby.
Well the building is amazing.,Looks wonderful on the outside! Good for pics. The shape is artsy and interesting. We didn't do much inside other than wander around.
Amazing Design !!,"A must see when in Seoul. For photographers of all levels, this massive and unique design looks spectacular at night. During the day, it is a wonderful place to find younger locals who are always willing to practice their English with you....and of course a selfie or two!"
Wonderful Building,"There are many little shops in this Plaza, but the most interesting is the building itself. Inside and out is it a marvel. "
Love the roses!,I was there in the night. Not really sure what to see except the fake roses field. The roses are so beautiful in the dark! 
"LED Rose Garden, awesome, skating rink","We went here on Sunday night to enjoy LED Rose Garden. We came from exit 1 of Dongdaemun History and Culture Park station. The building was so awesome. There was a skating rink there. Besides of rose garden, there was some exhibitions inside the building. Some of the exhibitions were free. "
Visit once,"The place looks surreal but I enjoyed visiting it especially since we went there at night. The building is a sight to see definitely but nothing much to do there. There is some shopping inside but the malls across the street from the DDP are more interesting. We looked for the touted thousand lighted roses but they were a dud. They looked like their lights were on their last blink, and they were not worth braving the very cold temp for. One visit is enough for me."
Where shopping and art meet!,Shop till you drop or take a walk with art it its futuristic form. Even when it is closed it will still make you awe with their thousands and thousands LED ROSES at the back and the night spot lights emphasize the sexy contour of the building!
Modern buildings,"This is a cool spot in downtown Seoul. I enjoyed walking around and through the rather large plaza and building designed by a probably pretentious architect with an idea of modernism. Still, there are plenty of shopping options and overpriced cafes :)"
Artsy Fancy,Marvel through the architecture wonder by Zaha Hadid. We enjoyed browsing through the designers' item on sale at the time of our visit. The building is pretty at night. 
Great looking building,The exterior of the building is absolutely striking and the interior is just as fascinating. The current exhibition looks neat but it seemed a bit pricey and small. It is an interesting place to visit if you like taking pictures and it's a place that you are going to like it or hate it.
Interesting place to visit,eye openers for new idea and design. great place to visit if have time from major sight seeing places in Seoul
Overrated place,"Soooooo boring. Don't know. Some people like the building but inside nothing interesting. Only few expencive shops. Was glad to see a good shopping center nearby, so it made the way there not so useless :)"
"impressive building, less impressive exhibitions",Just the building and the surrounding area alone are worth a visit. There weren't many exhibitions going on when we were there though so the design shop was actually the most interesting thing inside with so much cute anime or kpop inspired things or design pieces.
Great architecture,This huge unusual building has no corners or straight walls. Walk around it and enjoy the interesting surface of the building. You will also pass the old city wall. If you are smart you take an elevator of a the highest highrise building next to the DDP. Once you have reacherd the top floor cross the roof by foot and from the staircase of the connecting building you have a perfect view on DDP and the old City wall. 
Nice Architecture,"We came to see the rose led installation but since it wasn't dark yet, they weren't lit. The building is pretty cool architecturally and we enjoyed walking around the complex. There was a lot of walking space free from vehicular traffic. Also, we walked inside a couple of the buildings. Entrance is free."
Architecturally stunning,"If you love beautifully designed contemporary buildings, then it's worth checking out DDP. We visited while there was a fashion show and there was a lot going on, but there's also some shops and some art museums and stuff. I believe there's kpop groups performing here from time to time, as part of 1thek's Run To You project, so you might even be lucky to catch a performance! "
Nice disigned structure and cultural space,Nice disigned structure and cultural space. there is 2 times of fashion week a year. nearby Dongdaemoon market.easy to access with metro
Great Architecture!,A great place to see modern buildings with unique designs. There are shopping malls & art museums to visit. Very nice view and a picture perfect place if you are in Seoul. Not to miss this place! You can also catch the Seoul Bus Tour here.
My favorite place and building in Seoul!,"Incredible this construction! The Building is amazing and the gardens are very well organize. Dongdaemun has lots of things to do, museum, temporary expositions and shows."
Something different for all ages,"Located next to the Dongdaemun History and Culture Park subway station, DDP looks amazing in its design. I wasn't into architecture as much but it was a great to see something this unique. In addition to the exterior, there were exhibitions inside that showcase some intriguing and quirky everyday products from local designers that can be bought. DDP is surrounded by multiple shops in the Dongdaemun area so it can be a little side trip from shopping."
Visit it at night,"This place should be best to visit at night when the lights come on. An impressive building by day, the structure and its surrounds really comes alive when the sun sets, and the various angles get enhanced by the external lights."
Don’t miss the audio tour,"Although there are still some minor works going on in the interior and exterior, this is an extremely avantgardistic and impressive project - at the site of a former stadium. Don’t miss the self-guided audio tour (4000 Won) with good background information on 16 stops outside and inside the complex. Also some design oriented shopping opportunities on site."
Only If Design Interests You,"This is an astounding building, inside and out, totally dedicated to cutting edge design in its many forms. Different studios, office space, conference areas, some shops and ..... We went on Monday. Most of the shops are closed then. But we loved seeing the building from the inside and exploring the area around it. If contemporary design does not interest you, just drive by!"
Must visit this cool architect,"This is a great piece of art by a world famous architect who had left us with many of her designs in other parts of the world. Also the Seoul government committed a big piece of land in the city for such project. (clap, clap, clap)Inside the building is many shops for design items that I have not all visited. Will plan to go again the next day."
Great designed building ,"Newest landmark connected to the subway and history and culture park station. There are some building artitechure statues. There is a park way. Near by are shopping malls, street market and seoul city wall and museum "
Excellent Design + Interesting Displays,"Dongdaemoon Design Plaza is very famous for its unique design + interesting displays. This monument is located very close to variety of shopping areas, including Dongdaemoon Market and Doota (Shopping Tower)."
Interesting architecture,Nice place to visit. The architecture of the building is unique and interesting. Also a lot of stalls selling artsy and unique things from bags to cellphone accessories. Lots of places to seat outside as well.
Fantastic Design and Archtecture,"Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) is the newest and most iconic landmark of the Korean design industry. Located at the center of the Dongdaemun area, the DDP will serve as a key venue for design-related shows and conferences, exhibitions, and other events and gatherings. Designed by world renowned architect, Zaha Hadid, DDP is the world’s largest atypical architecture. The DDP is comprised of five halls: Art Hall, Museum, Design Lab, Design Market, and Dongdaemun History and Culture Park. The Art Hall is the primary launch pad for the Korean creative industry. The hall is a key venue for conventions, trade shows, exhibitions, fashion shows, concerts and performances. The Museum Hall brings together Korean design and global trends. The Museum Hall is comprised of five sections: Design Playground, Design Dulle-gil(trail), Design Museum, Design Exhibition Hall, and the Design Rest Area. The Design Lab serves as an incubator for rising Korean and international creative product designers. The Design Market is a multipurpose space that combines culture, experiences and shopping. This hall is open 24 hours a day to provide added convenience to visitors of Dongdaemun Market, the town that never sleeps. "
Masterpice,"Very beautiful building, very strategic place. There are so many shopping centers around the building. The night view is amazing, there are so many shop inside the building but the price is rather high compare to other store. This place is accessible though the metro. A must see place in Seoul. If you going for a shopping, I recommend you to visit Doota just next to the building, The gift shop there are cheap."
Design,"Subway can reach. Very convenience. You can shoot some nice photos there. Other than that, nothing much inside. It sell alot designer product. "
Gigantic,Worth a train ride just to see it's enormous structure. There's some shopping stalls inside but a expensive.
Breathtaking architecture,"Love the designs by zaha hadid architects so went to visit DDP in Seoul. Night view is just amazing, must see, there are some shops inside and also museums."
Costume delight,"World famous architect designed building. A wonderful costume display when we visited, interesting retail outlets.reasonably priced clothes amongst the boutique shops. "
Take the Time to Enjoy,You'll probably bypass this location. You're loss. So many free items to enjoy. There are different types of things to experience.
unique architecture,designed by zaha hadid. many exhibitions are open here. also there are many designed shop in DDP. 
Worth a stop,I couldn’t help but think of the Sydney Opera House and the Sagrada Familia when I walked around this structure and marvel at the what we can do today with the help of modern engineering and technology.
"Too popular, but I don’t think it is","It is a very popular place, but it is more saying that it rally is. Has some cool places but not enough for a big place. I’ll doble think if I go there again."
Great place,"As a student of architecture, and I especially liked the unique architecture of this work. It was created by Zaha Hadid, a great architect !! I really admire! Architectural exterior as well as inner space is extremely great! Inside the building is a shopping area with art shop , and an art exhibition placeBehind, have a rose garden are combined with light creating a space like heaven! "
Seoul Biennale of Architecture and Urbanism at DDP,"I went to this exhibit, which is mainly housed at the DDP and was wowed. First, the architecture of the building itself is really very unique, with its undulating curves and color. Very futuristic and stylish. Then the main attraction was the exhibit, which was incredible. It was very obvious that a lot of work went into perfecting it and I really appreciated it. It was so full of information, that one visit would not be enough to soak in all the knowledge. We had a tour guide and that worked out really well because she saved us from having to read and glean all the information ourselves. She highlighted everything for us and answered all our questions. Even that took some time. The tour may be enough for some people, but those who really want to delve into the exhibit can return and use the tour guide as a roadmap for tackling everything. The other part of the exhibit was located in Donuimun Museum Village and we went there as well. They really complemented each other very well. Well worth a day trip and a return visit, time allowing."
Nice Building But Not Very Exciting,"The building and the history points on site are nice but otherwise it's just shops on the inside.My girlfriend said it was one of the top ten things to see in Seoul, but I reckon you could safely miss this one."
Unique items in Gift Shop,We went to this shop twice as it had so many interesting items made by students in the design school. Most were a little pricey but good to see the creativity that went into the final products.
Just shops only,"Other than the brilliant architectural design of the premises, there is nothing inside. No exhibition and just some stores only."
"incredible futuristic place, must go","one of the must-see places in Asia I'd say. It is very futuristic, zaha hadid made an incredible design. The shops downstairs offer designer gadgets, clothing, home accessories, toys, etc. It is an incredible place, and the coffee shop is nice, I suggest getting a mango beverage."
Seoul of the future,"This is a wonderful, modern complex that is stunning to view just from the outside. Inside are many galleries and exhibitions and the interior design is equally as impressive as the exterior. Some of the exhibits do charge, but the complex as a whole is free."
visit,"As a fashion shopping area for young people, I would recommend it as a place for tourists. that there is no design for older women. if there is in the sightseeing and trendy designs everyday."
Innovative design,The Design centre has several exhibition floors where you can find both local and overseas designers with their innovative art products. Some are of artistic value while others are product of daily use. Some special exhibitions are free of charge on Eednesday. The souvenir shop on ground floor features a lot of innovative gadgets. Worth a half day visit. 
Come at night. The building looks magical when the lights are up.,"Even if you aren't interested in the exhibition inside, visit at night and walk around the complex. The lighting reveals how magical this architecture is. It will surely steal a lot of photo taking moments.When you visit inside during the daytime, you will even more amazed how marvellous this architecture is. You will be like strolling along exhibits on the walkway rather than in exhibition rooms. Without knowing, you will already be on the top floor or bottom floor. There are lifts inside but if your physique allows, try walking. "
Futuristic building,The building here so artsy and futuristic. Be prepared to amazed since its not something u always get to see and there are also garden of led roses that shines in night. Best to visit day and night
Amazing design,The plaza is big and the design is unique. It has shops and eateries and a nice place to hang around. It is also near to the night market. A very lively place indeed.
Amazing opportunity to see Zaha Hadids work,"Awe Inspiring architecture, lots of exhibitions. design and concept stores. Great picture opportunity."
Uber ultra cool,Was floored by this building. Great for photo opportunities. Very unique style. Lots of querky gift shops inside too which are good for souvenirs. Located right by metro exit. Make sure you spend some good time here to look around. Lots to see 
Glorified Coffee Shop,I guess check it out if you're in the Dongdaemun area for shopping? Nothing to do here besides get overpriced coffee and take photos.
Must see if you love architecture n design,"I really love this place! The building is huge, the complex is interesting, i like the minimalistic inside and the design.The hole plaza is nice. I was there for the Biennale of architecture n urbanism. ( sad fact though is that there is a market area in the inside where unfortunately random shops are located)"
Amazing architecture ,My fav building in seoulBeautiful landscapes and architecture designs in n outWorth a visit while u r here
amazing design,"we had a stroll at night, the building's architectural design is cool and pretty. There were some shops inside. and lots of open areas to hang out."
Attraction?,"This is an attention grabbing building with little utility. There is little going on inside... Some shops selling modern design wares, venders, cafe.. Nothing substantial. The Dongdarmun Market bldgs are still there with its shops crammed with products."
a great design,t must go there. A magnificient design. Like a museum but it's more than that. Should visit on Saturday's night. They have a garden of neon roses. So great. 
Amazing near-empty museum,"The museum building is amazing (5 stars) and worth seeing by itself which is almost the case. Is the museum a work-in-progress or has funding been reduced? There was a room full of chair showing design changes since 1932, an innovative play area for small children and that's about it. They were working on a stingy display about fall/autumn in Seoul with what looked like shredded paper and coloured paper leaves. I payed to see an exhibition on a Korean writing system party out of embarrassment for the museum and a desire not not leave the building."
"Nice building, but absolutely nothing to do","While the building on the outside was pretty cool, there was little happening with the actually space. There was no reason to even go inside it - a quick walk around on the outside is all it's worth. "
Romantic Place at Night,"If you do not know where to spend your night in Seoul, this place is not bad. It is windy at night. There was a public piano put at the street, anyone can play. My girl who likes to show off enjoyed it so much ^_^"
Beautiful Structure,We came here to have a stroll at night and this place was simply beautiful. There were loads of food trucks if you want to have some street food. The LED roses also made the place even more beautiful. Good for a night stroll and some picture taking at night.
DDP loved it,it's an architectural master piece in my eyes. Never seen something like this anywhere. I love the night market and truck food. LED rose lights at night makes it charming enough. Head to 'Dongdaemun history and cultural park' station for direct access. 'Dongdaemun' station is next station and you might need to walk back to reach there. Outside of DDP there are lots of shop and the famous Migilore and Doosan shops.Eat n shop
Beautiful structure,"The Dongdaemun design plaza is a beautiful structure. You can find here a few big fashion musea with a few big event halls, although I never had the luck to visit anyone of them. Everytime I visit the place (about every couple of months) there are no events.The design plaza is a good place to relax in a quiet place, away from the buzz outside in the many fashion shopping malls right beside."
A beautiful modern architectural design,You don't see this type of building in your day to day life. A moden marvel of architecture. A place where people who love archetecture can enjoy. (my kids were not interested though)
the architecture is mind blow,this place is very big and so many tourist. its not even a problem here. maybe because its near to shopping mall and food truck outside. we bought some souvenir at the road down there. and the street food look really tempting. yall really should try that.
"Weekend food trucks , bazaar and flower lights !!","What started as an attempt to see the flowery lights that we only see in kdrama's . I was surprised to find that on the Saturday night that there will be loads of food trucks lines up in the vicinity of the DDP. Boy the choices was good... looking the portion of some of the order it was also quite filling and not to forget smells soo delicious. We just had dinner , therefor was too full .. But we did share a churros , which was awesome!! Crunchy on the outside with a soft chew fluffy insides . Besides foodtrucks, there were selfmade artist selling their arts and also a blowup balloon arts that was everywhere .. a very good night out and loads of photo Opp's.!! Do checkout this is on the weekend. The night life from cheonggyecheon river to the malls opposite the DDP seems like its always busy with something during Saturday late evening to night... =)TIPS: for those who doesnt have much time to spare in korea.. these places are all within walking distance to checkout - Cheonggyecheon River end- Grill Fish street - Dongdaemun Shopping Malls -Multiple BIngsu places -multiple Train stations nearby - if you come in the morning even have a historical landmark too""forgotten the name"". sorry... but the DDP is quite central easy to make it a landmark ""In-Case-Of-Lost"" among a big group.. =). ENjoy!!"
Where old meets new,"Dongdaemun is a pretty interesting place, with its countless street markets and architectural design, but it's nothing really more than a few photo ops, here or there. I do visit Dongdaemun frequently, to clear the head after a heavy night out, but there really isn't anything you would write home about. If you are into photography, it is a fantastic place to practice your depth of fields and length snapping, but it's nothing compared to the palaces you have on offer a mear 3 or 4 stops away in Jonggak or City hall. I suggest visiting only if you have bags of time and you are passing Dongdaemun on the subway."
a very 'zaha hadid' architecture style,"If you are into Architecture, you must visit Dongdaemun Design Plaza. I went here with great expectations and totally amazed with the building - although I am not a fans of zaha hadid style of Architecture. The building itself is breathtaking, because of its enormous size, and also because the architecture is so unusual. The building features a shapely facade made up of aluminium panels.One of a must visit place in Seoul."
Lively and youthful ambient with futuristic feel.,"We went there for the night market.We were attracted by the Kakao Friends shop, and spent some time there taking photo.The Night market opened at 6.30pm and it is outdoor. The tables are limited, but there are plenty of bench we can sit. There were music performers who showcase their talents. The food stalls were plenty. Some are so popular the queue can take a while. It's recommended for night out with family. "
Breathtaking architecture ,The architecture is simply amazing and mind blowing!There's a lot of space to sit around for a picnic so I suggest getting some beer and chips from a convenience stall and sitting down on the many small alfresco dining areas or the grass hill!
High tech architecture,"Near the fashion areas and large shopping malls, this is a harmonious and curved architecture that can be seen from far"
Divine Architecture,"I am in awe of this building! It has got to be one of the coolest Zaha Hadid buildings. Definitely worth checking out at night, when the electric rose gardens are lit and the building lights up with changing lights - it makes the whole complex look like this futuristic organism. Absolutely worth seeing in person - photographs can't do something of this scale justice. Inside there are lots of galleries and exhibits. I didn't get to pop into them, but my Korean friends raved about them."
"Big, big space","I enjoyed walking the halls of the Design Plaza, but I was expecting more art and less commercial space. The exhibit space was nearly empty and very few staff were working in these areas. Most visitors were in the mall or restaurant area. Very cool building and a great place to spend a few hours. This place has huge potential and is a great addition to city culture."
"Breathtaking Building, but then...","You would have a hard time finding a more splendid building. From the grassy roof to the curves that you want to touch, this is a one of a kind place. Walk about the grounds and just take it in. After that, well...there is not much. A art shop area was actually sort of a cheesy mall. A coffee space, while amazing with a huge interior barista area, was largely empty of people and soul. Other spaces just were not used, leading to the question: what is this building for? Pretty, but then what? "
A place I never get tired of visiting!,I love DDP. There's always something new and fresh to explore. I feel creativity coming from every angle and love wandering around looking at the buildings and sculptures. I love that there's a continuous change of exhibits and love the vibe of the whole area.
accessible,"happen to drop by... it is via Dongdaemun History & Culture Park subway line, which i cannot remember now. but it is nice to just wander around this area and visit the shops in the plaza..there is also a tourist centre downstairs where u can sign up for tours, etc. or simply take a brochure or two.."
Lights exhibition,"This place holds various exhibitions and fashion shows, so it really depends on personal preference. The last time I went was during its exhibition. Quite a nice view except that the pictures didn't turn out good on my phone. This is located at Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station (Seoul Subway Line 2, 4 ,5) and Exit 1."
Night lights and shopping,Come after dinner to see the lights and appreciate the architecture of the Design Plaza before heading to shopd which open all night. Accessible by a couple of metro stops
If you're into architectures...,"Yea, if you're into architectures, yea this is a must go place for you. But if you're not into it, DDP might only be a strolling place for y'all. BUT, there's this LED flowers now, and it looked really nice! Of course, it's in Dongdaemun district so you can come here for a good stroll at night after you finish your day shopping! Cause there's duty free shops and blah blah blah!"
Great Design,"The structure of DDP is worth the visit. There isn't much going on during the day but evenings are filled with street vendors that selling food, souvenirs, clothes, etc. The outside structure is very interesting with great architectural lines."
Must see in Seoul,"The architecture of this place was amazing! It was beautiful inside and out. We went in the afternoon and missed the lighting of the LED roses at night, but even in the daytime, those flowers were impressive, especially the history behind them. There were nice shops inside the actual building, and even the kids enjoyed the place. The surrounding area is a shopper's paradise although we didn't get to actually go inside those stores. I would definitely explore this area more if I had more time."
Great architecture - loved it!,"Well worth going there to see beautiful modern architecture, museums and interesting shopping places with stuff from local and international designers. Nice open areas to hang around and chill out. There is also a public piano if you want to entertain yourself or other people."
"impressed by the architectural design . simply out of this world with great accessibility to metro, buses","Impressed by the architectural design . simply out of this world with great accessibility to metro, buses. Its in the heart of Dongdaemun - the East gate shopping extravaganza!."
Great piece of architecture,"Great piece of architecture and design, if your lucky there may be an interesting exhibition on as well (we got lucky with '30 years of pixar'), design shop is cool too. Def one to see if you are a fan of architecture "
Amazing design,"Seoul is city of design. One of the most unusual design is Dongdaemun Design Plaza. I love it, inside and outside!"
Interesting Building,Interesting building with exhibits. Lots of shopping nearby and there is a subway station at the plaza.
Worth the Visit,Worth the Visit when you're in Korea. Been here for two times already and this place still amazed me. 
Eye popping beautiful!!,"Best to visit in the evening with changing and throbbing lights and all! We did not bother entering as we were so tired from a day's tour, we just posed and took some selfies. Next time, we'll check the schedule of events. "
Unique Architecture Design,The DDP is good for photoshooting and you can easily get an instagram-worthy picture here.I went there at night and the DDP is just look like a UFO stations at Seoul city. The lights on the DDP blinks slowly at night. You can take a walk around DDP and enjoy the night view of Dongdaemun.
"Stunning architecture, so windy!!","There are museum/ Exhibition center/ in the building, you should check schedule before visiting! After I had shopping near around It's very convenient to take subway there! I love Seoul!!!! :)"
If you are interested by design and architecture is good to visit.,"The building is it-self interesting to visit. Small museum shop, some shopping area. Good to take a coffee at the garden or at the terrace."
impressive structure,"DDP itself has nothing much but the exterior structure is amazing, and surrounded by lotsa malls which means endless shopping!"
Great place to take photos,This place is great to just wander around and explore. The architecture is magnificent and lots of good photo opportunities. There are also several picnic spots. You can also visit the museums and exhibitions inside for a price.Very good for dates or if you're tired of shopping in Dongdaemun.
Felt incomplete ,"We went here with friends one night for a look see. The buildings themselves are really cool architecture and the rose light garden is great to see, but apart from that much of the buildings are still empty and the design part is not so obvious. There is a good atmosphere in the precinct and opportunity for good food."
One of iconic landmark in Seoul,Artistic modern design it was really open my eyes must go place in SeoulThen walk inside the culture park you will see the LED light roses field...main reason what's attract girls tourists to go there 
"Look stunning design from the outside, located in excellent location of Dongdaemun..","When I first see DDP, I think it may be a science park or something extraordinary inside, I think this DDP is invest by the Seoul goverment to showcase the products that create and design by Korean talents, well worth a visit if you have spare time.. "
Great bulding,I was surprised to see this beautiful building.. And then I discovered that it was designed by Zaha Hadad the great engineer.. You can go around the build but I don't think there are much to see and to do inside 
Architectural dream,This is my second visit here. This time not on purpose as I went to see the night market but at night the Design Plaza looks very cool! Probably best in the day if you want to have a bite to eat but at night visit it with other things in the area!
"Interesting building, not much to do there","The DDP facility is neat to see but when we visited in June 2017 there wasn't much to do there inside. The design museum was featuring a Korean calligraphy exhibition entirely in Korean so that was kind of a loss for us. It is worth walking around the grounds for 20 minutes perhaps but in my opinion there wasn't anything to do in the facility itself. Plenty of big-box stores in the blocks immediately around the DDP. Yes, it's on the cover of the Lonely Planet Seoul guidebook, but I don't think it's sufficiently emblematic of Seoul or Korean culture to make it a must-see."
Amazing Zaha Hadid building ,"Go in the evening and marvel at this magnificent building. It undulates, turns and rolls across the space. Truly a tour de force. "
Beautiful and well designed unusual building,Highly futuristic architectural design and awesome place. A must visit when in Seoul as it will leave a lasting memory for sure. 
Amazing architecture!,"I have never seen anything like it. From the outside it looks like a complex stadium or maybe even a spaceship. Inside the spectacular designs continue with elaborate archways and fancy lighting. There is so much to see and do here from shopping to eating. I have visited this place twice, mainly because my camera loves it here. Make sure to put this one on your list if you are visiting Seoul."
Beautiful architecture,The architecture was very impressive! It's really an icon for art. They held art exhibition regularly too.
Jaw-dropping architecture,"Located in the Dongdaemun shopping district, you couldn't help but be awestruck by the jaw-dropping architecture of DDP. The gargantuan size of the building is simply too hard to miss as it totally dominates the Dongdaemun area. It is even visible from the Seoul city wall nearby. I must say that together with the 555m Lotte World Tower skyscraper, these are truly Seoul's modern iconic wonders!"
Amazing architectural experience,"An amazing building to see and walk through and around, it is huge, curved and has a sci-fi look (we are sure there will be Sci-Fi movie made there one day). Just outside Dongdaemun station on Line 2, when you walk out of the station you encounter your first sight of this amazing building. There is a cafe at one end of the building worth visiting and shops in other parts as well as a museum and large outdoor sets (huge camera) and old piano that you can play in the walkways. If you have the time, worth a visit and a possible look into the future."
Phenomenal ,You cannot help being mesmerised by this stunning structure which dominates the area. You can marvel at the lines and its shear size. Make time to see this spectacle from the mind of the infamous Zaha Hadid. Can easily combine with a visit to Gwangjang market and a walk along the city stream.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
Fabulous celebration of good design,Spectacular designed building celebrates small new designs inside. Travel up to 26th floor of the shopping plaza opposite to get a good view. See the precinct at night to see the LED white 'roses' at night and visit the museum at the back to see the history of the site. 
Shop till you drop,"Lots and lots and lots of shops!!! Can be quite pricy for the local designers apparels, pay for their quality. "
Nothing. Simply Nothing.,"There's nothing special about this place. If you pay extra for the special exhibition that you want to go, then maybe it's worth it. Other than that it's just the building. Nothing else."
Immensely satisfying to behold,"The DDP (Dream Design Play/Dongdaemun Design Plaza) is humongous in its entirety. It's also a great place for people who appreciate modern art and architecture, as the DDP holds about 4 floors worth of exhibition space for lectures, talks, and other brand launches (When we visited last week, they were even hosting a launch for Louis Vuitton and Pixar Animation). Even if you have nothing to do here, the area itself is like a playground for the senses. Everything was built to tower over you, and it encloses you in this serene space away from the bustling city just a jump outside of its entrance. There are places to sit, floors to ascend, and it's connected to the subway proper so you'll never get lost. A lot of retail stores and restos beneath it were closed when we were there as a family, but the ones that are open look cozy and modern without being too pretentious. Plus, this is a great place to linger because DDP is literally next to the busy Dongdaemun City center and crossing. You can access Doota Mall or Migliore from here (Doota is more expensive, Migliore is cheaper for clothes and other goods) Great place to get lost in! Would come again :) "
Beatiful and intriguing sprawling architecture by Zaha Hadid,"Impressive and unusual architecture which needs to be viewed by walking around and in it. Unfortunately we were unable to see the design exhibits due to lack of time, but just walking around the building as it snakes around a vast are of land was an experience by itself. Be sure to research where exactly you want to go as it truly is sprawling and information even from the staff may fall somewhat short of what you will need."
Beautiful landmark of Seoul,"DDP is very attractive building with beautiful lightnings at night. It's a nice place to walk around, don't miss the artificial rose garden."
Modern architecture building,Modern architecture building with great landscape. Outside is better than inside as the shops inside are a little disappointing. Went to see the night LED roses landscape and totally worth it for the photo.
beautiful architecture,the building is beautiful but not quite sure what's inside this magnificent building.but at least the exterior of the building and the historic park were amazing
Great piece of contemporary architecture,The place is vast and multi functional.The architecture is stunning but discrete at the same time. During Seoul fashion week it become the main spot
Lacks leadership,"While the building is impressive, the content inside is less so. I was disappointed in the design store as most of the Korean products have been removed compared to my visit a year ago. I could not identify a clear sense of vision as to what the DDP provided. "
Went to see the LED roses,"The LED roses were really pretty at night, thats the only reason I went there.. haha.. and there is a Kakao friend store too!"
Beautiful architecture,"Nice building, stunning architecture. The building houses some small museums but I did not visit them. It's located in a very nice area with lot of shops, restaurants and foodstalls. Also there is a market of such which sells everything from phonecases to socks and pots & pans. "
Nice but needs time !!!,We didn't plan well so ended up reaching here quite late and by that time we were tired as well. It's a nice place with lots of activities for kids . So if you want to spend sometime with kidd doing done design workshops this is the place to go. 
DDP,We found the area to be interesting and enjoyed the historical museum and the old wall. The actual exhibits in the building weren't of a much interest to us. The staircase in the main building is amazing
 Nice for photo shot!,We go there in the evening so we can enjoy food truck and taking the photo with flower lights. There many local vendor too.
Many decorative items shops!,It's a nice place to sit down and take a break from the shopping. There is also a huge atrium inside where they sell many interesting household decorative stuffs. The prices are very reasonable. 
Interesting designer shop here,"My opinion is that such buildings like this DDP (as well as other buidlings by Zaha Hadid architecture) need more space outside. You need to have a better vision of the general buidling to get more impression (take Baku, Azerbaijan for example). But here the buiding is stucked between other surrounding objects and you can't get the right feeling. Anyway, if you have never seen Zaha Hadid architecture - it is worth a visit surely. At the same time I must mentioned really interesting designer shop here (if I am not wrong it is called Designer Lab). "
everything costs money to see,didn't see anything because you have to pay and not sure if it will be worth it to see do didn't end up seeing anything.
best place,As dongdaemun is famous for its shopping area. this plaza adds beauty to this place. this plaza is also a fashion hub there fashion shows are held regularly.
Amazing architechture,"Just seeing the building is impressive in itself. The shops inside are pretty generic, but just going to check out the architecture is worth it. What a great piece of art."
Fabulous architecture. Upmarket design shopping but not exclusively Korean,"Really glad I went to check out the famed architecture. It really is quite stunning. The Design Lab is also good. Expect high end prices on quirky goods. Lots of international representation, so dont expect everything to be Made in Korea, although there are enough local designers to make this a worthwhile destination for souvenir shopping if you have some money to spend. It's not cheap. The structure is huge, and perhaps the retailers were a bit overly optimistic about traffic volume. The whole second level of design lab is closed.... kind of like an overly hopeful kid that planned a huge party, and no one showed up! The coffee shop in A3chive has good coffee. Not overly impressed with the sullen service by the twenty something crew, BUT they made a good brew. Some fabulous sculptures outside, so have a good walk around to take it all in."
Great Design,"Thought there would be more to this place. There is a movie theatre and places to eat at the lower level, but not sure it was what we expected. Could have spent the time somewhere else."
Unique Building,"Very nice and unique building in Seoul. Near shopping center as well. We went to this building because of the strange shape, didnt really get into the building and explore"
Exciting fashion week!,"I happened to visit this area during fashion week in March. So much fun seeing all of the people dressed up, wannabe models and photographers, various food trucks and so many people. "
Cool place,We visited DDP on a tour. The place is pretty cool if you are into funky and unique goods and souvenirs to take back. For example they have a stall which can make 3D statues of yourself which are made of plastic using 70+ cameras. They also have goods by unique designers from overseas as well. They venue is popular with local families. 
The POI in TripAdvisor map is not accurate. ,Actual place is another 1km away. We ended up taking another taxi ride to the actual place. Google map would be a more actual representation. 
Unique interesting place,"The plaza design is one of a kind and worthwhile to visit just to see. Especially good for a rainy day. The design shop was puzzling. We most enjoyed seeing the art exhibition on the Korean alphabet Hanguel, which had an entrance fee. Other temporary exhibitions at the time were about Pixar films and Cars - great for families. The dongdaemun history museum is small and interesting, and displays artifacts found at the site, and explains the building of the city wall and gates, so worth a visit."
Surprised!,"Not being a fan of Museums, well I thought this was one of them, it surprised me, it had shops restaurants and everything in between. It even hosted food trucks! Amazing! Well worth the visit!"
Good for a quick visit,"If you're already at the area and have a few minutes to spare, then it won't hurt to go here. There are a lot of magnificent art and building designs to see which is great for picture taking. Aside from that, there are also various food carts which features authentic Korean street food that will keep your tummy full while exploring."
Seems like a waste of time,"Really nothing much. Most people visit because it is near Dongdaemum and the building design is unique. The shops within are just a waste of time, in my view."
Very modern building,You can't missed this building if you shop around Dongdaemun. The building structure is very special and big. Take some time to explore the place. Better to visit in the evening as the lights are beautiful.
Worth 10 min,It is worth of stepping out the metro for 10 min and taking a photo but not much more. Exhibits and shops inside are boring and only interesting place is the black hole like tunnel they showcase on photos.
Night view,Happen to visit this area and still has some time. Decide to walk over to take a look of this Silver Dome. This is unique structure by itself in this tall buildings area.It is ready huge building and think is the same idea as The Arc in Daegue.
Amazing architectural building,"DDP is close by to Dongdaemun market, didn't think we will spend much time here but once we were here it was really quite something. The Design Lab had many different stalls selling different artists unique crafts and gadgets. We easily spent over an hour in there. Worth visiting for all tourists."
A Must for every modern architecture and design lover!,"Not only stunning from the outside, the inside offers a huge range of museums and designer shops where you can find design gems from great young and talented designers."
difficult to take taxi at night,"I came here for the DDP night market. The night market closes quite early. My friends and i arrive there around 12 at night and almost shops are closed. We didnt eat anything there. Luckily we took some picture with the LED roses for 5 minutes. Lights turned of very soon.Most importantly, the MRT was no longer providing service since it is too late, all the taxis are not willing to follow the meter. (a lot of taxi were waiting outside Doota but none of them willing took us) Lastly, I spent 20,000W to Mapo-gu, which is 50% off already. Remember to bargin the price or leave before 12 am.This problem is the same in this district, we didnt take the taxi in crowded area..."
Day trip to Seoul,I have never seen so much shopping in my life. There were hundreds of stalls and stores in the area. You can buy wholesale and also by the peace. Anything you need for a home or to wear is found here. I purchased many items. A must see.
Amazing architecture (closed Mondays),"I didn't get to go in but did enjoy this massive architecture from the outside. I went up a department store to the 10th floor, and got a bird's eye view of it, the building has a balcony. See photo."
Beautiful architecture!,This is a beautiful building from all angles and when we visited there were some great stalls by local artists set up. The shopping nearby is also well worth a look. Plenty of restaurants nearby too.
Art for Arts,"This is an up and coming tourist attraction mainly because of its initial appearance to a korean drama, My Love from Another Star. But the place is really a work of art that houses different art exhibits and other events. Go here at night to see the entertaining light display of the whole plaza"
Amazing place,"First i saw this buliding, so exited. Its so unique like ufo building ^^I recommend you to go here at night because its more beautiful with led rose garden. Light floor like tetris just wow to me can go here. Its really modern Building Near with doota and other fashion marketI just regret didn't get into this buildingNext trip i will explore all ^^Dont forget to come here when youre on dongdaemun area ~"
It quite expensive,It is not really a good place to shop...but a best place to see latest fashion if you love K-Pop. It is quite expensive ...but a good place to stroll around
Zaha Hadid at her best,"This incredible space was design by starchitect Zaha Hadid, the building hosts the Dongdaemun Design Plaza and exhibitions spaces occupying the landscape like a spaceship. The entire space comes to life at night surrounded by a field of LED flowers. The impresive building has a futuristic design and deserve a visit by any architecture lover. "
For art lovers,I visited the plaza during winter where Fornasetti Practical Madness was featured as the artist. The lovely architecture of the plaza was even more celebrated with the fusion of Fornasetti's design pieces strategically positioned on every curve of the design plaza.Want to come back for more.
Good place to take some photos,"Impressive design. Nearby park where you can also take some pictures. I was really impressed with the design of the building. Was not able to visit the shops though, will check them out next time."
For architecture lovers,"We liked to walk around this place. Lovely architecture. The design lab inside of one of the buildings was not what we expected, stores that sold some stuff. We thought that it will be some kind of architectural design exhibition."
Go for the architecture,"The DDP is worth a visit primarily to see this architectural masterpiece by Zaha Hadid, the first woman to receive the Pritzker Architecture Prize. I didn't find the shops particularly interesting, but they're worth a quick visit."
Hints on this place,1) Main thing about this place is its cosmic architecture. Spend some time and try to rich all points and layers of this gorgeous building.2) Two small museums and exhibition spaces. Museums have free admission. Admission for exibitions varies.3) Lot of small shops in Design Labs and Design Market. Good place for gifts hunting. Price range — mid and up.4) Very nice nursery room. Beautiful garden on the roof.
Very futuristic,Went there on a Monday and found out it was closed. But decided to visit the design shop on the 2nd floor and found some nice unique boutiques. Hope to return in the future to check out more. 
Unique and modern landmark,"New landmark of Seoul, it was nice to be there really cool building. DDP is the place for Seoul Fashion Week if you want to know that feeling being an model just go there and take some photos lol but inside the building you can find souvenir that very unique and cool desiged from young designer or famous designer of korea also you walk aroung DDP you gonna see LE Roses garden recommend to visit there at night really beautiful"
Amazing place to visit,"There is the museum, that is a great piece of architecture. There are different exhibitions going on it during the year.Then you can find a lot of clothes and products from local brands. There are places from very cheap local stuff to very fancy and expensive items. A must to visit in Seoul. "
Tourist attraction,"Very unique architecture building! A landmark in Dongdaemun designed by the world renowned architect Zaha Hadid. It features over 40,000 aluminum panels on the exterior walls. There are exhibition spaces, design museum, sky lounge, rest area and a souvenir shop. Several museum, some free some need a small fee. The Location: Subway Line 2, 4, 5, Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station, Exit 1 or 2"
high tech area with lots of tourists,"with electric info guides in the areasleek modern designthere is baseball museum2 sunbway stopsgo there at night pls, lights are amazing"
Personal Favorite landmark of Seoul,"Designed by Zaha Hadid with neofuturistic design. I admired this place so much, photogenic spots to get picture, or just relax with friends in the evening."
Impressive place to visit,Went to this place one Sunday morning-- I had a good time just taking photos from the outside.. its quite big.. accessible via the train..
"Forget shopping, do this instead","In short they call it DDP, and it caught my eyes since we were crossing the street. Luckily this place was just within walking distance from our hotel. I prefer to stroll around DDP while my friends shopping at Dongdaemun Market and Doota Plaza. This is such an architectural feast, with its neofuturistic design, it gets a lot better at night with the lights bouncing off the buildings. I felt like I was walking into a spaceship! A child in me is hoping to find some Star Trek - ish ornaments or some Vulcans around here...just kidding LOL. They have several museums and shops inside, but I think the exterior was much more interesting. Go around the exterior and enjoy the sculpture gardens, all the way to the LED garden. So much photographic spots to explore. What a stylish way to spent an evening. And the good thing is, it's all free of charge."
Modern architecture at its best,In the hectic Dongdaemun i loved spending time watching the architecture here. Lots of good photo ops.
Amazing architecture worth seeing among average shopping/city life,"We recently spent an afternoon exploring the Dongdaemun area and found the design plaza truly amazing from an architectural standpoint. It was a cold, windy day but we highly enjoyed viewing the design plaza and the sculpture garden around it. The shops and businesses inside are average. We think seeing the exterior of the design plaza is much more interesting than the interior. It was a fun place to cross off our to do list in Seoul!"
Worth to visit,It is nice designed building and there are small interesting shops inside. You can buy unique goods there. Also its neighbors are interesting such as shopping malls and nice restaurants. 
Stylish place in Seoul,It is one of the stylish places in Seoul. Please check some exhibition in this place if any - some of them are very popular. You can also approach many famous and inexpensive markets near this place.
Architectural wonder with entertainment package!!!,"We were just passing through the way and got a view of Dongdaemun design plaza. Then we just could not put our eyes off the glitterati and beauty of this place at night and walked in. It is a huge architectural wonder which has various art and design studios, shopping places and restaurants.It was fun watching the musical talent show going on outside which had a huge young and lively audience.All in all it is a complete entertainment package.I would surely recommend this place."
Spaceship,"It looks like a space ship to me and I like its cool design. There is museum, gift shops, tourist info center inside it."
Great Architecture and Public space,"Great Architecture the Must to visit in Seoul for art and design fans, Enjoy the fantastic space for photo shooting"
"Great architechture design, cool place for hangouts ","The design is great! It was modern, huge and very interesting. A new place for gather .. hangouts .. and especially becouse the place become a spot for design and arts activities there are much you can do and gather from this place. Very interesting. It also very close to mall where you can find foods and points of attractions. This a place you can spends hours at it. "
Beautiful at Night,We visited the plaza after hours when the building was lit up and the retail shops were still open. It is an architectural marvel and close to great shopping at Dongdaemon Market and Doota Mall.
What An Architechture Gem!,"an awesome work from the late Zaha Hadid! It's timeless. aside from the awesome shape, check out how sunlight bounces off the building. "
Great Design plaza,a super cool architectural building in dongdaemun.... the great spot for those who likes to take a picture.. cause in this shape are unique.... recomended for tourist and local people... my advice go to this place at night cause the light are gorgeos :D
Modern building,This is a huge building with modern design. Worth the visit just to see the shape of the building. There are shops on the ground floor.
Zaha Hadid's masterpiece,"Great design by Zaha Hadid, easy to reach by metro and near to dongdaemun market and doota mall. Great place to study on architecture detailing (as i'm an architect too) visually attractive and picturesque. There is a mall downstairs and connected to metro station. "
cool architecture,a super cool architectural building! there are also lots of events you can visit inside. Don't forget to visit the LED rose garden on day and night. It's super beautiful
Modern design,"If you are interested in Modern design structures that push the envelope, then this is certainly worth a visit and walk round. Lots of shops inside and a museum, and there are cafes and snack carts outside."
Worth checking out for shopping and entertainment,It's pretty modern and cool place to spend an afternoon... plenty of shopping to be done nearby and it's right off the subway station. 
Stunning to see and Quirky Design shops,"I've never been in the museum side, but the design plaza is a unique little shopping area. I've bought some interesting things in here before, and it might be worth a look around, but I think if you are visiting Seoul that there are much more interesting and better places to go."
An amazing marvel engineered structure,"This building is the face of the future. Very modern and very impressive architectural details. You find here also the location of the hit korean TV series ""My Love from the Star""."
Unique Architecture Design...,"The 2nd time to me to go to DDP, but for my big family is their first time, they very exiting to see the beautiful and unique design of the building, inside area beside museum, there a lot of resto area...."
Amazing architecture,It incredible futuristic architecture makes Seoul (together with Tokyo) great cities balancing the old and new! The place is huge and deserves a few hours to be explored.
A cool and unusual place to visit,"I visited here with my family of four including two young children. The building has a unique architectural history and design for those who are interested. Also, there are several stores and direct access to the metro. I wouldn't stop just to see this, but one can visit in quickly in passing. Enjoy!"
Architecturally Intriguing Building,"Sweeping design, contemporary lines, open interior . . . a building that draws and maintains your attention as you explore its exterior and interior. Rooftop garden, angular spiraled stairwell, and more. The changing exhibitions inside vary from inspired to insipid. (I've been here four times over a four-year time period.)"
A must see!,"In this spaceship like building, my kids got to ride the virtual roller coaster, fee was very reasonable.There's also this one area that has 260+ cameras that took a 360 degree picture of my daughter and my son. From those pictures, it created a 8"" tall (you select the size) figurine(action figure) and 2 weeks later, it came in the mail to my home. It's not perfect like a photo, but it sure is really close! My kids were hesitant to try, but I told them that one day when they become my age, it'll be fun to show their kids what they looked like at age 15 & 17. I love it!!!! It's such a wonderful keepsake for me, and one that my kids can treasure and admire in their latter years. My kids were surprised at how much it really looked like them.Across the street, there is a multilevel (maybe 8 stories) shopping center, that from the outside it looks like a department store, but in the inside, it's actually an indoor market where each stall is independently owned, and you can bargain with the price. They also sell some knock off wallets and purses too."
Fun place!,"We wandered into this place, and were surprised to find all sorts of interesting stuff. I particularly enjoyed the stores with modern design items that I had not seen elsewhere. Some great travel gizmos."
Unique!,Unique architecture. A place to walk around. Many good LED deco in the plaza. LED rose garden is very nice too. Worth a visit!
Nice building,I really wanted to see the building itself. It is quite amazing and defiantly something worth seeing. We had a look through the design plaza and there were many cool items you could buy. 
Enjoyed the LED Rose lighting at night,Interesting architecture with interesting sculptures scattered throughout the vicinity. It was a nice surprise to find out that DDP sits on top of an archaeological site so there were some artifacts that you can view together with modern ones.
Dongdaemon design plaza,Magnificent building and worthwhile to visit. However there is not enough signage for visitors to navigate around. The led lighted flowers are beautiful to behold. It was definitely a beautiful and challenging walk during the winter night.
Very Impress,unique shape of the buiding..feel like space-ship from under the roof..haha..went inside and see the technology..very impress..
Futuristic Building,"This design plaza is designed by an Iranian Architect. Located right on top of the subway line (DDP station), its such an amazing building. The plaza itself is nothing to shout about, with some restaurants and shops, but the building futuristic design is the attraction. Do visit the LED lights Flower garden besides the building. Take some nice photos there. You may adjourned to the surrounding malls for your retail therapy. Dongdaemun area is fantastic for food and entertainment. "
A must for Zaha Hadid fans!,"The DDP really is a wonderful piece of architecture and as a Zaha Hadid fan was a must on my to do list.Would highly recommend visiting at night as the whole place is illuminated and the lights sort of bounce of the building, it really is beautiful and you can really appreciate the curvature of the design. A plus with visiting at night is the flower light garden which is a fun walk and great photo opp - very romantic for date night!If you're heading the day, chill with a drink int he middle and listen to people play on the piano, check out lots of sculptures around the plaza or make a 3D model toy of yourselves - would recommend you go early in your trip for this.DDP was one of my favourite nights in Seoul and as a bonus you can walk across the road to Dongdaemun Market and Doota for 24hr shopping to make the most out of the night."
Nice architecture but what else?,"I`ve no idea why other traveler like this. From outside it looks really great - thats a fact. But inside it is a joke. Half of the building building belongs to conference center and in the other part you can visit ""normal"" exhibitions. The design mall is of course a normal underground. And totally disappointing was the fact, that you can't find anything to do with design."
great to explore,"The building looks awesome from so many different angles. There is additional artsy stuff to see inside the building. The plaza itself has a lot of open space and sculpture type things. In the surrounding area, you can find lots of stores for shopping too. The whole area is worth a visit."
An icon,"This is one of the best masterpieces ever done by the superarchitect, Zaha Hadid. I visited Seoul over the years to witness its construction, and the end result said it all. Every nooks and crannies are simply sublime, and yet, they all fit in together and the layouts are in such a coherent manner too. This Design Plaza is an internal Plaza that's providing a platform for local designers to showcase their ware. There is a Museum, Galleries (when we were there, there were presentations on Fornasetti, and works from Smithsonian Institute), cafes, green area, shops at the basement that's linking up to the subway station. There are pianos being placed around the outside of the Plaza and so, from time to time, they might attract proficient pianists whose playing would imbue the environment with music that would elevate our aesthetic appreciation to yet another level. All in all, Design Plaza to me is magnificent and if there's one thing that you must do in Seoul, make it this one~"
Good architecture,"Seoul is so modern and the architecture here reflects that well. We had a great stroll around this area, which was bustling with tourists. Nice thing to do in and afternoon, if you have it spare. "
Impressive architecture,"Another landmark one must go to. It is not so impressive from afar but once you go to the plaza itself, it is really impressive. Of course having the shopping around the area adds to its attractiveness."
Into the future,"Oh yes! This is a good place for street photography, snack time, dating time and much more! Good and clothes store everywhere and you will be going home a a bunch a hand. Love it!"
Beautiful Architecture,"Designed by Zaha Halem. Great for photo taking. The state of the art and futuristic building. Love the rose garden. Went there in the night, the led roses are all lighted up. In the mall, there are design shops that sell creative design stuff. via Dongdaemun History & Culture Park subway station. We spend about an hour here."
DDP,"Been here a couple times already. Right by Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station, Exit 1. Such a modern architecture surrounded by other art exhibitions. Lots of restaurants and shopping around. Good area of Seoul to visit."
Amazing Architecture,Love the unique architecture of this plaza which is in the heart of seoul. It is located in dongdaemun and is within many malls
Picture Spot,"This place is good for taking pictures. If you need a place to take a picture with an incredible background, this is the perfect place for you. Especially during Seoul fashion week, you can meet many attractive and fashionable models. Sometimes, there will be events here such as flea market and performance. There's also a lot of museum here and stores. The stores here are relatively expensive than other places."
Curvy architectural attraction,"I visited this place with my sister who is an architect. As an ordinary people who came as a tourist, I found this place was really cool and had many sides you can take picture and enjoy the view. As for my sister, she really enjoyed her time admiring this building and its curvy design. This place is really sophisticated but beautiful."
Dongdaemun Design Plaza,"State-of-the-art design, surely one of its kind! Worth a visit if you appreciate architecture and unique building designs. Never seen a plaza like that before, very pretty sight. Totally enjoyed the visit there."
Stylishly Modern,"Loved the lit LED roses, thousands of them. And the shops inside offers unique souvenir items that you can bring home with you."
A space ship in the city...,"It is a modern and amazed architesture and it is good for visitors to tour around this attraction day and night. Also, the park is very close to two different metro stations ""Dongdaemum"" and ""Dongdaemum History & Culture Park"", with walking distance to the old east gate of the city - Dongdaemum, as well as Cheonggyecheon Stream."
Great architectural design,Its unique design is an attraction. It's nice to walk around the structure to appreciate the landscape at the other side of the building. Spacious pathway for a big group of tourist.
Humongous architecture,Went here around sunset time. Loved how the sunset was beaming against DDP's walls. Can be a bit tiring on the way up if you're not into walking up a slope :P Very accessible via Dongdaemun History & Culture Park subway station.
Seoul Space Shuttle?,"A local called it the Space Shuttle, which does not give justice to this gem of architecture. The spaces undulate amidst the sometimes monotonous and rigid glass-and-steel buildings that surround it. Get inside and get lost in the curves and waves as you start on the lower level and end on the 4th floor. Terriific artwork scattered all around will keep your visit interesting!"
Futuristic design,Dongdaemun Design Plaza is around Dongdaemun area and it is accessible if you are heading to Doota Mall from the Dongdaemun Subway station. Just a stop to capture some nice photos but encourage to go Dongdaemun Design Plaza in the morning to see the whole building.
Amazing architecture,"This place is very beautiful, especially if you like modern architecture. Reminds me a bit of Chicago. There is a very nice design shop there that sells different kinds of stuff (the kind of things you can buy from MoMa shop in New York). There is a place that can 3D-print stuff for you. There is another place that can take pictures of you from every angle, and then 3D-prints you. Yes, you. A miniature 3D figure of yourself. There are many samples to see from.Dondaemun Design Plaza is a 20-30 min walk from Myeongdong, I guess. In my opinion, it is a must-see in Seoul. 5 stars."
This is a must in Seul,"DDP is designed by Zaha Halem deceased in March 2016, a famous female architect. Just amazing venue. The led-lit roses in the garden makes everyone happy, the statues are all of interest, the venue is a birthplace for the new designs to come. Wonderful experience."
Unusual architecture,"I lived near this place, so visited it several times. The place is worth visiting by those who follow the modern trends in fashion, as well as by those who would like to look different from the conventional crowd. The prices are high, so there's no way you will find smth cheap."
Neat place to visit,We visited DDP for its well known architectural design but were delightfully surprised to find that the various exhibits were actually quite interesting. Took tons of amazing pictures with beautiful composition. Worth a trip whether you are into design or not.
Nicely designed! ,"Nice place for photo shoot and enjoyable exhibitions from time to time! I've been there twice, still feels like going there again!!! The building is beautiful both day and night!!! Such a relaxing place !!! "
A very Unique Plaza.,"This place promote Design and Art. For those artistic people should visit this place. You will love this place. The Building itself has already make a sound of it's sound....and it sound like:""D-E-S-I-G-N""."
Oh My Zaha,"Such a beautiful building designed by the late Zaha Hadid. A must-visit for all art enthusiasts. You don't have to be knowledgeable with art to appreciate their exhibits. I was lucky to view Paik Nam June's full show the first time I visited and a smaller PNJ exhibition the second time I went. Both shows knocked my socks off!Inside, you can sit on benches designed by Zaha and shop at the M1 building where you can find quirky items and toys. :)"
very modern architecture,"The building's architecture is very unique and modern.There are exhibitions inside but you have to pay a certain price to see them.Admission fee depends on the current exhibition,but you can still check the inside of the museum for free.The whole thing looks like a spaceship.2 hours should be enough to check the whole place and take photos."
Things of your wish at a negotiable cost,The plaza is full of variety of goods only you have to negotiate wisely. Woolen clothes can be on priority list as you get wide variety of fashions and styles. The souvenirs though rather at a fixed and higher price. 
Amazing Architecture,This is one of eye catching building in Seoul. Located on top of subway station (Dongdaemun station). Surrounding area is lively during day & night. A lot of duty-free complex. 
Looks amazing ,Didn't enter but it is worth taking a look at it from the outside and a couple of great photos.Accessible from underground stations and very near to a couple of shopping centers.It is a vibrant place in Seoul.
Night view at night,The structure of this building makes it look a bit like a UFO and gives off this futuristic vibe. Do check out the exhibitions in there if you have time to spare! Recommend visiting at night with all the lights on.
modern and artistic,"A very modern, artistic and cyber looking building. Classical landmark icon to be. Visiting in day and night provided different atmosphere and impression. A definite place to visit for photographers and architects. Easily accessible by Metro. "
Good to walk outside and enjoy the architecture,"It is best to visit DDP in the night when it is lighted up. It looks like a spaceship! There are nice seating areas to wile the time away. Located at the Dongdaemun history and cultural park station, it is accessible and opposite the shopping area."
"Nice building, but not that interesting","Not a must see in my honest opinion. Nice to see the building, but the inside was so, so. Much more interesting things to do when in Seoul if you ask me."
"Nice building, nice night scene","Thousand of LED flower at the outdoor of the DDP( Dongdaemum Design Plaza). Nice place to hang out and relax, the place is just right of the exit of the train. "
Great place to see for creative people,"I have visited the DDP a couple of times. The building is artistically designed and it is a pleasure to see it both inside and from outside. There are various display stores. Next to it is the ancient wall and the LED rose garden. Both are worth seeing, but go at night, in order to experience the beauty of the lights. One of the Dongdaemum exits goes straight into the building and it is centrally located."
Interesting Part of the City,Nice architecture and good design. It really does focus on bringing all what Korea can offer design-wise around this place. 
Lovely LED roses ,This is a really modern building with direct metro access. Their Led Roses is beautiful at night time
Nice architecture,We went there at night and just so happened there was this huge fashion show/award ceremony going on.. So the place was filled with people.. very happening and nice during the night time but probably would be less impressive in the day
Great little shop tucked away inside,Always wondered what was inside this interesting shaped building. When we walked in we were surprised by the shops and places to eat. Worth walking through!
Interesting Design,"Interesting exhibitions on different floors, we started from the street level up. There's a mix of fun and serious displays which made our trip ""light"" and enjoyable. "
Symbolizing Korea's Ascent and Modernity,"Gosh, every time I visit Seoul, I'm always amazed how everything is so modern, clean and new. I then contrast it with San Francisco and see how far behind we are in museums, infrastructure, shops, etc. Even though Seoul is nearly 10x larger in population and 5x size wise, Seoul feels refreshingly accessible wherever you want to go while you can't even get on a train to Chinatown or the Marina in SF. Anyway, go inside (it's free or very low cost like most Korean museums) and marvel at all the open space, light, and avant-garde art and displays. I remember when I first saw this building being constructed in 2011 and then to see it completed a few years later, I was just amazed. I think its a worthwhile place to visit and its conveniently located right next to all the shopping in Dongdaemun. "
Great place to visit for an hour,I visited this place at night to avoid the crowds since I did not plan on entering the museum. It offers an outdoor space with seating and plenty of places to eat in the surrounding area. I was able to walk through the design plaza grounds under an hour
Great architecture and design,Visited this place at night after a brief shopping spree at the night markets.The architecture and design are impressive! This is a great place to visit both for locals and tourists. There are outdoor art installations and I think shops for everyone's appreciation. Too bad they were closed when we got there. Still we were able to enjoy the beauty of the Design Museum.
Terrific architecture and sculpture,The buildings are great examples of the wealth of excellent modern architecture in Seoul. We enjoyed walking around and seeing the endless curves from different perspectives. We also enjoyed the excellent sculptures which are part of the complex. We were there fairly early in the day and did not see anything inside the buildings. They were between shows and there did not appear to be anything special at that time.
Very wierd architecture,"Very odd, curvy, futuristic architecture. Feels like you are beneath the U.S.S. Enterprise. Was there at night, not sure what goes on during the day."
PRESENT / FUTURE / ETERNITY,"Absolutely incredible building (RIP Zaha Hadid) and generally really well used space. The whole thing feels very modern without verging on a dated image of the future. A treat to just be there and walk around but the work on display really takes things up a notch. We were lucky enough to catch a mixed media Paik Nam June retrospective and a terrific, considered exhibition of different types of bowls from restaurants and homes that was way more interesting than it sounds."
Not open on Mondays!,"Plan accordingly, we found to our dismay it was closed on Mondays except it's Design Market which housed merely a couple of restaurants and a handful of retail shops. We were able to venture outside it's open park which is OK but interesting. Don't just come here for this attraction. However, it is very close to Dondaemun market where all the wholesalers are. Awe inspiring place, can't find anything like this in USA. So if you planned to visit DDP make it a whole day iterinary to visit Dondaemun also, walk the Seoul city walls which you can pick up opposite Heungjimun Gate. This is a quieter trail and less challenging.  "
My Seoul trip,"Dongdaemun is very close to Insadong, if my memory serves right, it was only two stops from the Jongno 3 ga station(blue line). I went there around 11 p.m., the design plaza was closed, but there was a lot of people still around.There are two large areas near the subway station.Mind you it is a large area and you will have to walk a lot.The area around the mall, across from the design plaza has lot of vendors along the streets. I saw shoes ( good quality) casual and formal wear, going for around $40.Just be mindful that the subway closes around midnight.Plan your trip so that you will not miss the last train.Be prepared to spend 2-3 hours here, so I would suggest go early.,The led flower lights outside the design plaza was not lit at 11 p,.m.. I figure that they turn them off when the design plaza(DDP) closes. Check the design plaza hours before you go there.Do not miss this area."
A must-see in Seoul. A perfect sign of the modernity of the city.,For those interested in modern architecture and in art this is a must-visit. Great for pictures and for breathing in the futuristic stile of the city.
Very cool,"Very cool building, there are exhibitions and shops, a great place for taking photos. You can access by Metro, if you plan to visit Dongdaemun, you should take a look after shopping."
A beautiful building ,The min you exit the subway you will be attracted to this building. Usually someone will be playing some music 
Amazing Landscape,I went here to see the museum designed by Zaha Hadid but was mesmerized by how it flows into the landscape and becomes more of a park than a museum.
Very Impressive Design Structure,"I didn't think much of the place when I saw it from across the road from the building in the day. But it is extremely impressive in the nights with the lights and all.In the weekends, its surroundings are lively with entertainment and little craft stalls. "
Very cool building.,I visited with several business associates to check out the design and architecture of the building. The only comment would be adding better signage for directions in and around building.
Best spot to buy special souvenirs,"The place is worth a visit for its architecture only. As a bonus, it hosts a design museum (which we did not visit due to time constraints) and a lot of design shops. There you can get great stuff for reasonable prices (not cheap, but ok!), and even wandering around these creative shops is a lot of fun."
Unreal adventure!,"Everything from shopping, cafes, and the subway, to design space, museums and galleries, this is a must visit when in seoul. We visited several times over a few days and found something new each time. Very worth a day of wandering."
Came for the white LED roses,Came by during the day and saw how modern the building was but mainly wanted to see the roses at night. Walked briefly around the building and saw there were exhibits and possibly a fashion/model event inside. Spent time shopping in all the plazas and went to find the roses around 10pm. Glad to see how helpful patrol staff are to point as to where the LED roses were. It was pretty although a little hard to capture in photos but the view was lovely.
"""Spaceship"" in the city center Seoul","Looks like giant spaceship, world's largest tri dimensional structure, open 24 hours a day, with many surprises inside....especialy latest design trends."
LED white roses,"Visited at night time to check out the LED flowers. It's good that it's only 2 stops from the Myeongdong subway station. It's just right outside upon exiting the station. The LED white roses are located at the 'Grass Hill'. I wasn't as bright as it seemed in the pictures I saw. Maybe 10-20 minutes tops to look around and take pictures, but that's about it. I peeked inside the building and saw there were museums and small kiosks, but most of them were closed by the time we got there. It's good to see if you have time."
Impressive Building,"This is a very impressive building but that's about it. Inside it is rather dull, not many things to do. However, one can take awesome photos around the building. I would recommend to visit this area only if you intend to do a lot of shopping in any of the many clothing malls around the Design Plaza."
White roses...,"A building that has art gallery + exhibitions. Visited here during evening, so unable to see any gallery at all. The main attractions here is the 'white' roses. A pretty scenery to look at but not all people enjoy this. If you are not the type to enjoy this kind of attractions, cross out from your itinerary or visit here after visiting the Doota Mall or other malls, just across the road from here."
Impressive Architecture,"We didn't actually go inside the plaza because there were no exhibits we were really interested in, but walking around the building and seeing the architecture was great. It's definitely an interesting building worth seeing in passing."
Modern and futuristic,"I never saw a place like this. DDP has really a modern, unique and futuristic design. You can take picture everywhere in this place and you can see the LED flower at night "
Good for family day out !,"Designed by Zaha Hadid, the whole area is hip and modern. Very accessible as it is only above the metro station. We went there in a sunny Saturday afternoon , there was lots of street arts & activities at the plaza. The book store & design shop are also not to be missed if one is opt for shopping !"
wonderful LED light show,There was the same light show in HK last year. We were delighted to see the same show in the Design Plaza. There isn't a lot of tourists visiting the plaza and we can have plenty of time and space to take pics with friends.
Shopping!!!,"Craziest 24 hours of shopping! Great street foods! Must go place in Korea! Bring your luggage carry on if you are planning to shopping seriously. They take credit cards, however, if you want discount of bargain negotiate them you want to pay cash so give me a good deal.  "
Best Plaza,"For you who watch korean drama must have seen a place with a white led rose scenery, and this is the place where you can see those white led rose flowers. For me it's better to see it at night cause all of those flowers with glow but maybe it's a bit hard to take pictures at night. The design of this building is just amazing and fascinating with such a beautiful lightning at night. Apparently this building closed at 11pm so for you who wants to look around inside the building maybe you should pay attention."
Design and Trendy,I enjoy inside the interior design stuffs. they also take care of the kids when you travel with them.
Must visit!!!,"Possibly the highlight of my trip. Visit at night for best experience. A very nice place to appreciate the architecture of the building. My favourite part of DDP is where the LED roses are located (you can ask the guards for direction, they are very helpful) as i am able to sit down at the benches provided and enjoy the skylines of Dongdaemun. After visiting, you can pop by to the opposite buildings for shopping (opens till 4am)!"
Art Museum,"Dongdaemum Design Plaza displayed some interesting arts, when were there. its nice to walk around on a sunny day, and the surrounding too, and there are many malls for shopping."
Impressive architecture,"This building has nothing to do with Korean culture. It is an impressive piece of modern architecture. It's facilities are used for fostering creativity, mainly in school age children. Excellent use of tax-payers money."
Vow,"Such an architecture! Vow. An alien spacecraft, modern, simplicity curve line, truly a center of design."
Reminds me of Australia opera house,Lots of warehouse wholesalers nearby. Nothing interesting happening at this site itself when I visited. 
Dazzling,"One of the most intriguing pieces of contemporary sculptural architecture to be found anywhere in the World. Buildings containing exhibition spaces, designer outlets, a shopping mall, art galleries and eateries. Outside spaces formed to provide gardens, market places and outdoor performance venuesAt night tome the place takes on a dazzling appearance with spectacular lighting and the backdrop of dramatic neon rainbow lit department stores. The ""rose"" garden with 1000's of illuminated flower heads is a pretty sight indeedVisitor amenities and information all excellent"
Huge metallic out of this world architecture.,It looks like space ship from outer space. Huge building with round and curvature walls and roof. Very futuristic design.Good to walk around and take photos. Some nice flowers inside viewing from the top. However i did not go in due to time constraint. Many people walked around the building. I heard it looks nicer at night with illumination. There are more people at night than day time.
"Nice architecture building, beautiful at night","If you are an art/architecture lover who happen to be in the Dongdaemun area, I would highly recommend to visit this place at night, it's very beautiful when it's lit up.I'm not sure if it's a ""must see"" attraction for everyone else, since it's just an interesting building. We didn't enter to see what's inside this building, we just happen to pass by while in the area."
"nice architecture with shop for shopper, museum and art exibihition for interested parties","nice architecture with shops for shopper, museum and art exhibition for interested parties. You can spent a day here."
Found I SEOUL U sign here,"I visit Dongdaemun market and accidentally found this interesting design plaza and the I SEOUL U that people said about too much before, only the sign here much smaller"
Interesting architecture ,"Visited this place at night. It's quite an interesting architecture to view, with several sculptures displayed as well. We did not go inside the museum and decided to walk around the plaza instead. A 30 minute walk/stroll would be enough in this place. "
Great architecture,The curvature is impressive reminding one of Bilbao and Disney. Walk around the campus and enjoy the various angles and modern art.
"Spectacular building, must see, legacy of Saha Hadid",This is an outstanding design and architecture building. The piece itself is worth it by night it looks like a spaceship. There are many temporary art exhibitions which are great to show local and international artists. There are also many small design shops around.This is a must do
Modern monument which contrasts whith the rest,The Plaza is an unbelievable monument which is magic during the night when illuminated. You can find exhibition spaces and art shops close to it.
Interesting design,"The futuristic architecture alone is good reason to visit this place. At the time I visited they had a huge outdoor flower display where each flower was lit by a small bulb, amazing sight at night. Aside from the ultra modern design of the building, particularly at night there isn't a lot to do here. It is however in the Dongdaemun shopping area with plenty of shopping and dining options around. "
Interesting morning or afternoon,Nice get away for a relaxing day of people watching and taking in the arts. Near Dongdaemun shopping area
Dongdaemun design plaza... In night of DDP,Shape like nest. Looking very interesting. I visited in September and weather was warm.. Actually I didn't enter
A structure,"If you like architecture, you will be fascinated to see this dome. Located in Dongdaemun (shopping area), you will get to see this surely. But nothing to do here, hehe."
Amazing,I like the architecture of this building. there are many exhibitions over there. i visited Dior exhibition. it was pretty good. and the park outside is so beautiful. 
Inspired Architecture,"My husband and I wanted to see this stunning building designed by renowned architect Zaha Hadid. Its futuristic design is something to behold. Three gigantic curved buildings are melded together to form one amazing structure on a huge city block. It is covered in silvery metal which must reflect and glow at night. We went in the daytime. Inside the building are shops, artist work spaces, and art exhibits. Lots of open air shopping surrounded the buildings on the day we were there. If you appreciate modern architecture, you must see the DDP."
Fascinating!,"Modern design of building, lots of innovative items to see and buy :) designed by the late iraqi architect Zaha hadid, at located near metro station, with fashon malls near buy "
Hello Donddaemun Plaza,This is a modern building. Its trends of Seoul city. Nearby with dongdaemun plaza so have a lot of travelers go to this place. I like this building because its stylish design. Appropriated for take a photos.
Nice design beautiful building with regular events,Dongdaemum is very good area for shopping and events. and design of this building is special and beautiful at night when light is on. Good for picture taking.
Modern design in Seoul,A fascinating building in the heart of Seoul. The building dominates the view as you emerge from the subway. We enjoyed going inside and seeing all of the modern design ideas that were for sale. 
Popular artistic icon in downtown,"The outlook of this design complex is very attractive and unique, especially during night time. There are various shops selling unique and artistic products. An icon for those like arts and design. Also, I appreciate people have enough public area to enjoy walking around this modern complex. You don't have chance to feel crowded peopled around you. So good!"
Very cool spot in Seoul,This is a very cool spot to start a walk in a very interesting area of Seoul. Often lots of events here in the afternoon as well and a walking street not far from here
City Lights!!!!! ,Remarkable design to display urban architecture. Even better at night with the illumination from the buildings and structures. Job well done! 
Unique design building,We were passing by and can't help but to notice this building. It is a very uniquely designed building which looks really artistic.
A great place to shop,"It doesn't matter how late it is, this is a great place to shop. Building after building of shops. I can spend whole day and night here."
Modern Building with much to offer,"The building itself is a nice work of art. It also contains art, exhibitions, restaurants, and shops. There is a lot to see, shop, and eat around Dongdaemun and I feel this is the centre for it all. It also hosts a night market on the weekends in the summer."
Beautiful Concept,"Visited this venue afew days ago. Take the green subway line 2 and exit by exit 1 which is obvious due to its design as part of the building. As a first-timer, I was privileged to be able to visit the ongoing flea market held only on weekends, late evenings for this month. Do find out more on their website if you're keen. There's many things to do during this summer period on a weekend - visit the mobile food carts (long queues for tasty food), flea market hosting many local designers items (but i prefer hongdae's free market), enjoy the light up led roses at night. Many photo opportunities indeed. I also liked my souvenirs purchased at the design shop. A special mention will be the architecture with its interesting spiral staircase designed by Zaha Hadid. I was also privileged to visit the ongoing exhibition paying homage to the late artist's Mr Paik Nam Jun. Eventful. One can visit the 24-hour shopping malls in the vincinity or hop on the tour bus infront of DDP after that. Do take time to spend your afternoon and evening here. Worth it. Will be ideal to read up online for more info on activities. "
stunning,Totally unique. Loved the design of the building and the furniture. So much to look at. Great way to spend a day walking and enjoying the terrific art. 
Fantastic architecture and art,"You can't just drive past, although you need to step back to see it as well as getting close up and inside. Dramatic bridges and staircases, a lovely rooftop green space, many interesting galleries, and the night lighting of the exterior is deeply affecting."
Visit to DDP,It looks like living biolumistic space station. There are major parts of ddp such as led rose garden ddp shop ddp design museum etc
Interesting architecture,"It is an architecture wonder, and it is definitely worth a visit to see it. It also shows the history of the stadium and before that. "
nice design,"Mall with nice design to take a photo with, but im not enter this place. I just go to dong daemun market near here"
ART,The exterior of the DDP is already an art. There's a museum inside as well as some ongoing exhibitions. An eye-opener for me!
DDP - unique architectural design,"DDP itself is unique in its architectural design, and even more beautiful at night with different lighting effect. When I was there, hundreds of LED flowers were planted and being lit up at night around the building, It was simply splendid."
Great 'space ship' exterior but mediocre indoor space!,"Over the years, City of Seoul has tried to beautify its old neighborhood with spectacular buildings such as this one designed by the legendary architect Zaha Hadid. It is a beauty to the eye of the beholder and perhaps more if you take the building in from the outside. Absolutely spectacular considering what used to be there for decades - a dilapidated baseball stadium with has been a big part of Korean baseball history. If the exterior of the building and the building itself is a five star, the inner space pales in comparison. There are knick knack stores everywhere and anywhere combined with children space, etc. People with younger family may enjoy the inner space of the building but the exterior is where one finds the true Zaha Hadid's vision."
So much to do here,Great shopping! I was there during Children's Day. The kids had more than enough to do. The shape of the building is wild! GO!
Gorgeous for night photography,"I stayed right next to the DDP and walked over one night to take pictures. Never got the time to go in during opening hours of the museum, but just walking around and taking pictures at night was beautiful. It's a wonderful space."
A visual adventure to Zaha Hadid's alien building in Seoul,"DDP is an alien building in the context of urban Seoul that one would never miss. However, the building itself offers a wonderful adventure of visually stunning curves of aluminum panels and concrete, which, to me as an Architect has a wonderful afternoon. The place is easily accessed via a dedicated metro station. Content is a bit deprived- not a good place to relax with a cup of coffee but a wonderland for photographers. The building has almost no right angles! There is designer market which you can have 3D-printed selfies in one of the booth. "
Spectacular Building both day and night,"The magnificent building is so eye catching and interesting. There are many different levels and areas to explore.Another trip advisor member had mentioned going at night so we did that as well - it's a must do.There is a great ""Design Shop"" in there as well where you can buy interesting gifts."
Come here at night for the LED flowers!!!,"I came here after dinner for a walk. Found the LED flowers by asking staff for help. The flowers are so pretty, just keep taking pictures!!! There are a lot of people here, everybody here for the pictures I guess (including me)."
Great looking from the outside,I just stopped by without going in. Make a stop while in Seoul. At least for a short while. Also close to the city wall of Seoul and a few other landmarks and markets.
Cool Design Plaza,Fantastic architecture inside and outside of the building. There was also some fun furniture and a coffee shop to visit during a visit. I highly recommend visiting this beautiful and innovative architectural site. 
A great place for a day out if a little expensive.,"We spent an afternoon here which was great, looking at new designs. There were four exhibitions on but each one required a separate ticket which were about 9000 each. There are a few restaurants and shops nearby. "
Structural Excellence,"A must visit in Seoul. Great place to wonder around. Very easy to reach by subway. You can just keep looking the whole structure. Its so irregular shaped but amazingly organized and without any corners. Lot of art exhibitions, shops, cafes inside. A great place for evening hang out.The beauty becomes more lively after sunset when lights turns on and gives the whole place a brand new look. The Les rose garden will just amaze you."
Impressive architecture,"This large complex by recently deceased architect Zaha Hadid has to be experienced on the spot. It acts as a large sculpture which changes continually as you move up, down, in and around it. It houses a museum (exhibition of Jean-Paul Gaultier when we were there) and an exhibition-cum-shop of Korean design – pleasant, but nothing earth-shattering"
Pretty architecture,It's a good place to chill and take pictures in it. It's usually the place for seoul fashion week so trendy people hang out here. it's 5-10 minute walk from dongdaemun shopping street too. At the time for our visit there was a dance exhibit so pretty cool and artsy too.
Interesting unusual historic,Great place to wonder about and lean about the history of Seoul as well as see some modern art exhibitions. Great food van market at night but I had already eaten. Beautiful LED flowers. Well worth a look.
CAN'T miss this building from the outside... Venture IN!,"Dongdaemun Design Plaza is certainly not to be missed, impossible, in fact. But this massive feat of engineering plays home to art and design exhibits inside and all manner of playful fun outside, at least in the Summertime when we visited. We saw an art exhibit, visited several floors of incredible everyday living design shops, watched a concert on an outdoor stage, played on intriguingly designed outdoor-furniture toys. Certainly a worthwhile stop on your Seoul tour and a worthwhile destination!"
interesting,right near the subway so easy to find.a couple of museums stores inside. children's area inside with climbing etc. used to be the site of a baseball stadium. lots of historical site around the property. worth a visit.
lots of shops,Its easy to get to this shopping area on the metro.We were very impressed by the range of shops and what they have to offer but the style wasn’t very good and the prices more expensive than we pay in Ho Chi Minh City 
Amazing architecture,It is bigger than the photos. A must see man made marvel in Seoul. Bonus: You have a lot of shopping complexes nearby.
Beautiful Architecture,"Personally, we went to Dongdaemun for the DDP only. The design of the entire complex is very good. We were quite spellbound by it. If you like to take ""vogue"" photography, this is one of the places you can explore. There is a very neat design store in one of the blocks. Be sure to go there. There are many interesting stuff on display / sale. We spent an hour in it."
"Building is cool, exhibit inside is blah","such a giant building for so little to see. The architecture of this building is cool, but there is not much inside to see. A few exhibits and lots of shopping kiosks with plenty of overpriced gadgets, art supplies and clothing. "
DDP Visit,"This was an overwhelming trip! The DDP is HUGE! It was easy to get lost and turned around in, but everywhere we went we saw something new! However, I was afraid that my partner and I missed something because we were so turned around! The main reason we went was for the electronic flower that lite up at night. We weren't there when it was pitch black, but it was dusk enough to see the lights. If you're not really into museum type attractions, I wouldn't plan a day trip there. However if you're in the area and it's getting dark out, I would recommend stopping by and seeing the flowers."
Beautiful design ,Great place to have a stroll at night Unique and modern design (especially if you're into architecture) Unique stores inside with one of a kind items Beautiful LED rose garden Lots of food trucks outside and long line ups (food must have been good).If you get bored there are several malls in the vicinity.Perfect nighttime activity when you want to walk off some dinner :)Enjoy! 
Beautiful night walkaround,Design Plaza in Dongdemungu has a visual and new seoul cultural attraction. Frank Architectural design in combination with outdoor frienship garden is the must choice for unforgetable walkaround in Seoul
Very pretty place to see at night,Great to stroll around at night - they had a flower lights display at the time so it was really pretty at night. 
Unique building,"Is a good place to hang out. Come visit at night for the beautiful rose garden. Bring coffee and with the person you want to spend time with . Several stores at there, nothing special. There is a piano at public, anyone can play it. "
Modern architecture in a modern city,"Interesting buildings and designs gathered in one place, but nothing truly spectacular unless you are an architecture fanatic or looking to shop in the malls nearby. Give it a miss if you're short on time."
Roses are the highlight,"I visited to place on a rainy day.Very interesting design, inside and outside.I had to wait an hour until they turned on the lights at the roses in the back garden. its an impressive installation "
Eh....,"I wish I would have been impressed, but I wasn't. I have to state that I visited during the day and from afar and later looking from the Seoul wall it did seem interesting, but the moment to go closer it is just okay. Greatly enjoyed the Design Lab space. But one thing that stuck out to me is the endless amount of just space with nothing in it. A nice visit while in that area, but going there extra isn't necessary. Though I might add that several shopping centers are close by!"
Museum with art from young talented artists,"If you like art, then this place will give you some time to spent time looking at art from young Asian artists. We spent about an hour, hour-and-a-half, overhere. You can buy them, if you like too. The personel are young Korean teenagers, who can help you out. But don't expect too much on the English from them.It is a nice, not too expensive stop in busy Seoul. If you don't like art, the skip the inside."
Truly Spectacular,This place is built for designers. Amazing place for photography and enjoy shopping designer's brand. This place have galleries and even have the 360-degree photo booth that captures yourself to create a nice miniature or sculpture of you! Went here in March and last week (July) was my second visit here and should also explore shops outside the plaza especially for those who loves sports!
Great place to visit!,"You can discover interesting exhibitions and most awesome Korean design stores. If it's your thing, then go for it. A plus, it's been quite a nice experience discovering this fascinating contemporary building by British architect Zaha Hadid."
DDP shines in the light,It certainly shines during the day but it really come into its own during the evening when the district comes to life
Beautiful at Night,"At the end of a long day, I had just enough energy to catch the subway about 4-5 stops from our hotel to check out Dongdaemun Design Plaza. Boy, am I glad I did! it's spectacular at night - especially the buildings' lighting and the LED rose garden. Visit at night!"
"Shopping,shopping, shopping!","This place was a bit overwhelming as we had limited time in the area. There were several shopping malls in this area, one next to the other. According to our guide, the mall we went to (I think it was called ""good morining"" or something to that effect) was the best (and cheapest) place to get souvenirs and gifts for friends and loved ones. There were also so many interesting food choice establishments. This place definitely worth going back to and exploring."
Very modern architecture and cool art,"You can take a nice walk outside, see interesting peaces of art and take great pictures. The building itself is very futuristic, I think it looks like a spacecraft waiting to take off. But anyhow, there are museums/exhibitions inside that you can visit with an entrance fee. The outside area is of course free."
Amazing place... ,Best visited from the outside at night but also pretty special during the day as you can visit the museum etc between 10am and 9pm. The bed of illuminated LED roses are pretty special too. 
A walk in the future.,"Really cool architecture and had a great time checking out all the lights from adverts nearby. It's like being inside of a pin ball machine, so much happening and lots of sounds and smells. Our entire family spent the whole evening just enjoying the modern architecture and meeting some talented young artists nearby. This is a perfect gathering spot to do something or just sit and enjoy doing nothing. The designs are amazing and so creative. Truly an enjoyable evening. Best thing was the cost = $0"
Futuristic design.,"Unfortunately when me and my family reached the place it started to rain heavily as such many open air performance was cancelled, however still managed to see beautiful piano recital being played. There are ample eateries and shops inside The DDP occupies 85,000 sq meters of space with many exhibition halls. However owing to the heavy rain, we were unable to walk the roof Park. "
Innovative building,The design of the building showed the innovative and creative of Korean. There was lots of street foods selling there at night. A lots of art performance have their performing on the center of building. A place to let you must drop for a visit when in Seoul
Stunning architecture ,Unfortunately we came there when there was no event. Also I wish I came at night when the led roses are lit. Nevertheless the structures and the ground are stunning. 
cool architecture,such unique building. and there were an outdoor skiing place in front of it which cool. I went there on winter tho. not sure if they still have it in summer
Passing through,Nice huge area where talented aspiring local artists and performers put up shows every evening. Good place to walk around for local art scene. 
Loved this place!!,"My son and I walked through this uniquely designed art building and purchase a great deal of local artist and designers who items were being sold. The shopping spaces are set up like incubators, giving each designer their own space. "
Dame Zaha's creation,"As an admirer of Dame Zaha's work, the Dongdaemum Design Plaza is my must go in Seoul. We ended visiting the Plaza three times. One in the morning, one in the afternoon and one in the evening. It's a very impressive and one really need to see it from afar, see it up close and see it from within to truly appreciate what Dame Zaha had created. Heads off to Dame Zaha for her vision and courage. Heads off to the South Korean government to commission this urban regeneration project. "
"Haven't decide yet what I liked the most, the building or Gaultier exhibition","DDP is one of Zaha Hadid's last works and that only makes it special! A clean design and a lot of contrast with its surroundings. Peace in the middle of caos. In order to appreciate the purpose for what it was created, I visited Jean Paul Gaultier exhibition and I love it! They had animated mannequins singing and talking. Even Gaultier introduce himself :-DSo not only recommended for architecture lovers. If you love exhibitions, there could be something for you too. And even better, it is located in front of wholesale buildings and you can buy cheap clothes for the whole family. If you have patience, you can find really nice things!"
Beautiful piece of architecture,"Not much happening inside this building, unless event is on, there is a design shop but items for sale are from around the world not uniquely Korean. But stunning beautiful building especially at night when it's lit up. Thank you Zaha Hadid! "
An architectural marvel,This unique structure has to be enjoyed both from inside and out side. The unusual shape can only be totally envisaged from a distance. An intriguing destination indeed!
A nice building,Love the outside gardens more though and yes another ok modern design - It is another pretty cool urban design idea and you will not miss it since it is opposite of Doota
A Zaha Hadid Masterpiece,"The vibe around here is sure to excite a weary traveller. This is a unique construction that screams to be explored.After wandering around we discovered a marker for a flame. But it was not the Olympic torch. It appears that this is an urban renewal project built on the site of a former stadium. We only deduced this after seeing the two light towers that are still standing at one end of the site.It is also a massive project and the immensity can only be appreciated from high above. Luckily, it possible to do this from the 10th floor of the Doota Duty Free Store which is just across the road.Full credit to Zaha Hadid, the architect and the city of Seoul."
Impressive,"Great architecture, interesting public spaces, innovative design ideas. Plenty of cafes and shopping as well. Nearby shoe market, fashion markets too."
Go around sundet,"Note- the trip advisor map locator is wrong: this structure is located at Dongdaemun history and culture park metro stop. As you emerge you will encounter this impressive structure, known as ""the spaceship"". Make your way through the inside to the top floor then exit outdoors and see it from the outside. Be sure to check out the design lab for funky design stores and concepts. The interior was also dotted with funky furniture and spaces to hang out. On a Saturday afternoon the outdoor space was a hive of activity, great for people watching, boutique markets and live music. Adding to the ambience were the pianos free for local maestros to show off to the public. Later on the hipster food trucks start up and the cool kids come out for the night.After sunset the LED roses lights go on which is another reason to stay after dark. Tip- for fantastic views from above go across the road to Doota department store and take the express lift to the 10th floor. "
Interesting building,The highlight was the children's play area where my 6 year old grandson spent most of the time. Some interesting designs - loved the ceiling decoration - a circle made from sticks.
Don't tell people you have visited Seoul if you have not seen DDP yet !,"Chapeau ! to the Seoul government taking on such a grand urban regeneration project. A place not to be missed , designed by the late Zaha Hadid - Grande Dame de Design. Do take time for a tour of the building. Saw Jean Paul Gautier's exhibition at DDP on a Sunday morning. Amused by the fashionable mother taking her equally well-dressed kids to this exhibition. In short ! Don't tell people you have visited Seoul if you have not visited DDP. "
Special Architecture,This new building is a very actractive. You can see exhibition and fair inside. It's a futuristic structure.
Just Wow,"very nice place specially at night, and good area for shopping at days enjoy all the site and visit also the monuments an subcultures nearby "
Smooth spaces,"The smooth curving design overwhelms the space and the lines draw you inside for great exhibits, in particular those sponsored by the Alliance Francaise."
Beautiful flower LED,"It's easy to go there by subway and if you didn't found the place that you want to visit, you just ask someone at there. They're so helpful and friendly. And the market is too near but you should go there before 9 p.m. because this time, the food shop is closing.Hope u enjoy at there and I'll go back there again. "
Awesome structure ... a must see,The building designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid is spectacular. Beautiful lines and spaces ... check out the information desk alone. Have to visit the Design shop ... great unique finds.
unsual building. small knick knacks,"This place had been reviewed in so many places that I have to admit that even though I had an enjoyable afternoon, i was a little disappointed after the hype. The architecture was indeed unusual with a lot of feminine round forms but since it was so big, when we came up close, maybe we couldn't appreciate it as much. There were three areas for us to go to - a marketplace, a design centre and a museum area. The marketplace has a lot of clothes and food store. The design centre had nice things for sale and it was buy some knick-knacks. The museum has temporary exhibits so when we came there was a Korean art exihibit and a Gaultier exhibit, each one with a separate paid entry. There was also a children exhibit for about USD 4/child but it looked kinda lame so we didn't go in. All in all, good day to spend the afternoon on a rainy day. If one comes in the evening, it would be better because there is a free light exhibit on until February"
Popular Place,Zaha's World. It has nothing to do with the former field but it seems like a great place to relax and spend time with your friends.
Unique,"When you get tired from all those shopping across the street, Dongdaemun is a good place to wind down and relax those tired feet. I didn't have time to go inside so I went to where the LED lit garden is. It's beautiful! I haven't seen a garden so creatively done and it's definitely not any usual gardens you'll see. It's futuristic and it adds more to the architecture's brilliance. See some pictures I took. DDP looks better at night. It's open for everyone and has an exit going to the train station."
great view at any angle,modern architecture and great for picture taking at any angle and floor. underneath you can find a major subway station with subway maps.
Captivating Every Time,"I visited the DDP twice on separate trips. I can say that both times I enjoyed touring through and around this marvelous piece of art. The smooth, sloping curves of the structure really stand out against the surrounding area of tall, rigid buildings. I would allocate a good 2-3 hours touring the grounds, split between the exterior and interior. You can walk to the top of the building via a sloped sidewalk that melds into the building. Then you can make your way down floor by floor and look at any art exhibits you desire. The best part is that you can do all this for free if you don't want to see any of the special exhibits. Location wise, it's also great to explore the adjacent areas right after your tour (my recommendation would be to walk along the Cheonggyecheon stream since its close by)."
History & Culture Park,"Dongdaemun is a great example of Seoul's new architecture. It's definitely worth a visit for anyone who loves architecture and design.The DDP isn't just a strange looking building, though. The DDP is also known as Dongdaemun History and Culture park, and is accessed via a station of the same name. The DDP also includes an exhibition hall, a ""design market"" (which is basically a small shopping mall) and a museum. I highly recommend visiting on any day other than Monday as, like most cultural places in Seoul, the museum is closed on Mondays."
Mainly shopping,It is a strange feeling to be in... But most of the restaurants are just great! Good for a short visit.
Pass by after shopping,Going here to see led flower festival. This plaza and all the buildings suround it are look so beautiful during nights..
Miracle Design Nicely decorated Park and Shoping Market,"Dongdaemun Design Plaza is a miracle design like a space Craft. Nice, neat and clean garden inside the plaza. and good shopping market outside. Nice place to spend time. I was there during an official conference."
Yes. A must.,Amazing structure on an unbelievable scale. The building complex is massive - you can't really grasp the scale unless you are there looking at the building with your own eyes. Fabulous in the evening with dramatic lighting.
For the Artsy,"Must visit for those looking for artisan and unique products ~ the design shops sell items that vary from watches to bags, to unique souvenirs. Items are a little pricier than the usual fare in Korea though."
Embodies designs of the future,"With its futuristic design structure, the DDP embodies building of the future. Some nice shops also add to the experience. "
Cutting Edge Modern Structure,"Dongdaemun Design Plaza also know as DDP is unique structure a blend of traditional buildings and cutting edge modern multicultural facilities. We just walk around the path of DDP and trust me it's worth it. With Lights on.. it looked amazing.Also, opp DDP you can find shopping mall and shopping street with local eatery on road side.Plan a visit at this place after sunset or late evening."
Really nice n worth ,"This place is really nice to visit, is designed by a woman designer , u really need to spend 2-3 hours to explore this place "
Great Public Site,"Enjoyed walking around this vast, amazing structure that concentrates on public welfare and innovation. "
Simplicity Can Be Amazing,"My wife and I stayed at a hotel near the Design Plaza and were intriqued by its beauty and size. As some had mentioned, its lighting at night served to draw walkers to come closer. Seoul has so many attractions, it is difficult to choose the ones to visit, but the Dongdaemun Design Plaza is # one...along with the many historical building such as the Changdeokgung Palace. I truly admire the Korean's preservation of its history alongside its new beauty."
"Great inspiration of the mind,",If interested in architecture and shapes and the blending of the living space this is a must visit. Very futuristic development and the design centre for the country.
Good stop for architecture lovers (and critics),"This is a cool area to explore, especially at night. Take in the plaza and shops for some pleasant browsing. "
Good but not a must see,"I will be honest, I dislike this style of architecture because it feels a little cold and impersonal. I felt the area needed more trees and other plants. There are some cool art exhibits worth seeing (and they frequently change) so check it out if you are in the area but I wouldn't make a special trip to come here. There are a couple small and free museums but they are a bit boring (but you might as well go inside if you are here, there are a couple of interesting exhibits inside)."
Amazing architecture by Zaha Hadid,You will have to spend a whole day in this building. Get a solid camera with wide angels to take in the sights. Or go up to neighbouring buildings to capture more pictures. 
Such a beautiful design by the only female designer to win an award,Must visit place if you're into architecture. It is designed by the only female designer that have ever won an Oscar equivalent award in Architecture 
Amazingly cool work of art,"The building itself is an architectural wonder. The shapes, the lines, the movement -- if you like architecture, this is a must to see. I went on a weekend and there were a number of vendors set up outside selling all manners of stuff: food (even free samples!), honey, jams, flowers, trinkets, handmade jewelry -- all tasteful and nothing kitchy. I should have spent more time inside as it is so different-looking than the outside. The building is so modern in so many ways.There is a wonderful LED flower garden that must be spectacular at night (I saw it during the daytime) and even an archeological site on the grounds, kept fairly intact.The building is on a couple subway lines and also has shops and restaurants galore in the underground arcade. There is loads of shopping in the district around Dongdaemun as well, as this is quite a fashion district of Seoul."
Better view at night,"I love taking picture of it at night time. It looked like a spaceship. When I got there at day time, the feeling was different. It's just next to the metro station. Very convenient and worth to go."
Really cool ,DDP is a really cool area. There are a lot of things to do here. Some of it is free. A trip at night is worth it. There is a $ Childrens area inside called iPlay. It is worth the money especially on a rainy day. There is a subway station and a mall. Plenty of options to eat. 
Spectacular design,Definitely worth a visit to see this very large and spectacular building. Walking in and around the building was easy but we didn't go in to see the exhibition.
Great shopping for those on a budget,The myriads of shops are amazing .. However be prepared for no fitting rooms/ clean toilets / credit card payments/ sign language to bargain ! 
Wonderful architecture,The plazza is a fitting tribute to the departed architectural genius of Zaha Hadid. What an extraordinary building and area created on the site of an old baseball field. I walked around the shop which is filled with products made by local South Korean designers and creators - well worth browsing through and spending some money on something special. At night the plaza is spectacular (i was told this).
Beautiful,Good for relax and take a picture. There are not much to do in this place but you can take a picture with a thousand electric flower.
