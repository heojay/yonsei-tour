The BEST of Korea underground shopping,"A bustling atmosphere, a lot of activity, and a variety of small shops. Prepare to be overwhelmed on Day 1 and go back for Day 2 with better a bigger shopping bag. Leave plenty of room in your suitcase for Goto Mall shopping!"
Fun place for women to shop and prices are very reasonable.,"The Goto mall is an underground shopping plaza easily accessible by metro. The stores primarily cater to women's clothing, shoes, handbags and accessories at a very reasonable price. On my recent trip to Seoul, I did buy quite a few dresses there and after a few wears and washes, they look good and holding up well. The dresses I bought were mostly under $10 and are cute and comfortable. There are a few household item stores and knick knack stores but primarily clothing. Best time to go there would be when it opens (I believe at 9 am- but please do check) as it gets very crowded with time. Overall, I enjoyed my shopping there and cannot complain about any item that I bought. If I return to Seoul, I will definitely make a trip there."
Good for Local Korea Goods esp. Shoes,"this is an underground mall like a hidden gem which is unfortunately not included in the ""Must Visit"" locations in Seoul. If you are looking for local Made in Korea Shoes you can surely find it here."
Huge underground shopping,Nice place to walk and shop around. Reasonable price. Mostly cater to female accessories. Probably one of the largest underground shopping area.
Goto Mall,"The items sold here are cheaper compared to Namdaemun market and any other underground shopping malls.I need to get a new winter outfits as I did not bring any to my Seoul trip.In less than ₩50k you can get a complete outfits, head to toe.I came by bus no 401 from namsan tunnel 3 near Myeongdong. Take the bus stop that heading to the tunnel.The stop is Express Bus Terminal. There are also subway lines that stop at Express Bus Terminal and you need to walk to the mall through the underground shopping pathway.I took bus as it is easy as the stop is just in front of the Gate to the mall-Gate 8-2.There are many entrance but that Gate i found nearer to the bus stop. I came here twice, Unfortunately it was closed during Lunar New Year, and even only a day off some of the shops extended to close esp the flower shopsThe crowds started around 1-2am even the shops opened at 10am. It was a long stretch shops with eateries at the both ends.It was winter and to shop in the warmth and covered mall was soo much convenience."
First stop for shopping,"Goto Mall is a local underground shopping mall and should be your first stop if you are looking for clothes, shoes and bags. Much cheaper than Dongdaemun and Myeongdong. The shopowners will also give you new products and not off the racks,unlike elsewhere."
great for ladies,"The place is long 2 lane of almost 500 meters long selling mostly ladies wear, some phone accessories and electronics very few male clothings available but price is just right and not on the expensive side.."
Shopping in Seoul,"Large number of little shops selling pretty much women's clothes and accessories. All around krw10-15000. All individual local fashion. Cosmetics socks bags and all. Some noodle and coffee shops. It seems most of the locals shop here.Some rest areas for the men with seats while the partners shop. Free WiFi somehow. Actually can't read what it says for sign in to free WiFi but after some blind clicks, I'm in. Catch train to Express bus terminal on line 9. go to exit 8 and follow signs to gotomall. Couple of shopping centres around but that's another story..."
Great place,Many many shops selling relatively cheap stuff. A must visit. Everything is cheap here. One of the best places in Seoul for budget travelers
Good place to spend a rainy day,"Completed indoors and price point is low. You can do all your shopping here when if the weather is bad. The stretch is endless and conveniently located to public transport. But if you are looking for quality, go elsewhere."
Nice place to shop,"This place is easily access by subway. The clothing are relatively cheap, you don't really need to bargain as the price are usually stated and cheap. Not like those in Dongdaemun where the price are usually quoted quite high and you need to bargain with the seller.It's an underground shopping mall, it's good to shop there when weather is cold, hot or raining."
Cheap shopping,"When it comes to cheap clothing, this place tops it all, it has all the usual cosmetic shops and loads of clothing stores, but the quality and the styles are more towards to over 30s. Not too sure about youngsters... "
Express bus terminal,"To get here, you could easily take the subway lines 3, 7 or 9. Take exit 8 for the nearest access to this mall and with a little exploring you are There! "
Best place to shop!,"Been here 4 times and I never fail to get something from this place. The different items offered here is much more than other underground malls in Seoul. Although this is not the biggest underground mall, but i feel that it have the largest variety. They have retailers selling not only clothes and accessories, but household items, paintings, decorative items, etc. Just bring a luggage with you when you go there so that you don't have to carry all the items you buy as they don't give you big bags even if you buy many things."
Average ,"Abit overhyped in my opinion . The goods were cheap but u really do pay for what u get . The quality of clothes were not as good as the ""made in Korea"" ones and appeared to have been imported fromChina . That said, being the shopaholic that I am I did pick up a few items that were really cheap . Prices starts from 5000W onwards "
Best place for shopping in Seoul,"This is definitely the best place for shopping now. I went to Seoul 5 years ago and everyone was going to Dongdaemun for cheap clothes but GOTO is so much better. This would be my first place to go for shopping next time I'm in Seoul. I could easily shop here for 2 days as its massive. When you come out of the subway both sides, left and right has places to shop. Highly recommend! "
Lots of cheap woman cloth,"If you are woman, you won't want to leave this place. All kinds of fashion you can find here with great price."
Women's heaven,"This is women's heaven, with a large variety of clothing at different prices, you must find at least something here. I got 6-7 pieces here at 5000-10000 won each, super good deal. And this place is underground, so not affected by weather at all. Best shopping experience in Seoul was found here."
good range of merchandise at good prices,"Besides clothes and cosmetics, there is also quite an interesting range of household goods like crockery and lovely turkish lamps. And the beautiful flowers( fresh and otherwise) on offer at one end of the mall provide a pleasant respite from all the bargain hunting. This mall is definitely worth a visit."
Super Busy Mall,"Love this mall. It maybe in Gangnam Underground but the merchandise is absolutely varied from shoes, bags,apparel to linens. The prices are better than the shops in Dongdaemun. If you are taking the subway, make sure you don't go home between 6 pm to 8pm. Too many crowds and people are queuing like snakes. "
Really good shopping mall,"You can buy clothes at a Very reasonable price , some tshirt I bought only cost me w$5000, really cheap , Also, very convenient , exit 8 of express bus terminal "
Mall,Lots of things to buy at this mall for reasonable prices. Always packed! Great location by the bus terminal
The place where locals shop!,"Shopping haven for reasonable priced fashion , shoes, bags, faux jewelry, household goods, indoor decorations, fresh flowers and Korean skincare/ makeup . the prices are generally cheaper compared to Itaewon and Namdaemun as it caters to the locals. Easy access via line 3,7 & 9. If you dislike shopping it's still a great place to power walk and burn calories . A complete circuit easily covers 600 m"
"cheap, starts 5000won and even sometimes lower","best place to visit if searching for low end clothing for girls. size is ""all size asian"", meaning it's small. but thankfully these few years trend is on larger oversized clothing. you can also find cheap 10000 won bags herelocated near gangnam. just below seoul station"
Excellent shopping place but ....,"This is really the place to go to for good bargain in Seoul for clothes. This place beats Namdaemun and Dongdaemun in our opinion for affordable and fashionable clothes. The prices are fixed and one can't try any clothes for sizing. We were told specifically that there will be no return and no refund should it not fit.There are quite a number of unfriendly retailers that seems to be particularly cold with foreigners who don't speak their language. This is obviously a place for locals.It's a 5 stars for price and probably 2-3 stars for the attitude of the retailers. Having said that, if shopping is your game, this place is the main."
shop!,"Make this your first stop for serious shopping in Seoul if you are looking for clothes, shoes and accessories. The prices here are the cheapest compared to places like Myeongdong and even Ewha. Worth your time to go through the shops right to the end as most shops sell the same stuff but prices will vary by a few bucks. Try the small eateries right at the end, prices are affordable and food is delicious."
Good place to shop,All the shopaholics should come here before shop in elsewhere. The price in here is much cheaper compared with others place and you can get most of the things you are looking at. The place not to be missed out!!!
Overrated,"It was fairly clean. Had a variety of items, lots of venders, nothing special. If you are looking for a small, trendy, misspelled, nonsense-english sweatshirt, you can find it here. They are really fun. The flower market was so much smaller than I expected but what they had was very nice. They had some Christmas items out that were pricey, but nice; Although, I saw no manger scenes or any religious ornaments. I did not try the food vendors but it looked good. There were some pottery venders that had nice things. Accessories, the same costume stuff as in Namdaemun.I also saw Typical korean linen and bedding shops that are in any village. Location: just under the express bus terminal and Shinsagae department store. The website says it's called GOTO mall but I only saw one sign there that said that. There are two parallel rows of shops, an escalator at the end, food courts at both ends, and I saw one elevator at the end . "
Shopping haven,"Conveniently located at Express Bus Terminal Station Exit 8. Lots of cheap clothings, shoes, accessories. Prefer the Gangnam underground mall which is bigger and has more variety."
Great place to shop!,"Great place to shop for cute clothes, I bought lots of shirts going at 5,000krw to 10,000krw, dresses going at 10,000krw to 15,000 krw. Got some very nice and cute work blouses too. Mostly for females though, shops for male clothing were few and far between. There were a number of cute accessory shops too, relatively cheaper than at other places e.g. Myeondong, Namdaemun,... Another perk is that being indoors, its a great place to hide out when it's raining/ too hot."
Shop till you drop and get the best deal in town,"This mall begins at exit 8 of the Express Bus Terminal Station of Line 3. It has the best deal in town for clothes, shoes, knick knacks. It was quite a strip mall lined with shops and is underground. We spent about 3 hours there and have to leave because the ahops are closing. Must come here for deals!!!!"
This should be in the top 5 attractions!!,"I would always look at trip advisor top 10/top 20 attractions for a city. i did not see this. good thing a local showed this place to us. it is 2km of comfortable, good value, underground, as far as your eyes can see SHOPPING! You will find lots of good buys. it is more comfortable than namdaemun and not as expensive as the department stores."
Loooooooong stretch of shops right under the ground!,"You can shop in comfort in this underground shopping mall and not worry about the weather! You can get almost anything here, from shoes to clothes and accessories, and household items!"
Best shopping in Seoul! Express terminal's go to mall !,"One stop shop! Everything that you see everywhere else is here and likely cheaper too! Mostly local shoppers, stores and stalls as far as the eye can see! Best place to shop in Seoul!"
