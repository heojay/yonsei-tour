Open Air Mall with tons of shops of all kinds!,"Conveniently located right outside Hapjeong station. Easily accessed. Plenty of stores. A couple of pharmacies, and a Homeplus."
Disappointing and empty mall,"Our reason for visiting this mall was to see a place called Liliput which is supposedly great for young kids and toddlers with lots of things to do and food etc. However, aside from what we considered an unreasonable price, we found it far from interesting.The mall itself is depressing, lots of concrete and a few interesting stores and eat places but really depressing. It reminded me of old council flats built in the 1960's back in the UK.It's saving grace I suppose are the colourful umbrellas suspended everywhere that at least gives the place some colour. However, what added to our poor impression of this mall is that there were very few people here, even at lunchtime."
A Calm Respite,"My friend and I stopped by here while touring the larger Hongdae area. It's an interesting place to visit as an American because it's an open-air shopping mall. It also has a nice aesthetic (as evidenced by the colorful umbrellas shown in the picture above, as well as the small gardens and plants throughout the mall. It was surprisingly calm and uncrowded on the Saturday afternoon when we visited. Not worth a trip to for its own sake, but certainly a nice stopover if you're in the area doing other things and need some shade, a bathroom, or just a place to sit for a little."
A desolate-looking mall,"I would name this place a ghost of a mall because there was hardly a crowd... a trickle of shoppers at the individual shops that look deserted. The only place with a handful of shoppers was the supermarket at the basement level. Yet, because it is a mega mart, the supermarket looks desolate too. "
Best shopping center in Hapjung Station.,"Nice place. every thing is there,what you want to buy...I liked this place. Mecenatpolis mal building in so expensive building. i wish i want to bye a flat in this building. Home plus is in underground."
Not worth the trip here,This is an open air mall with the usual brands you could find anywhere. The place was quiet on an afternoon weekday when we visited. This is certainly not a place to come all the way for. 
Friendly and colourful,"I don't think it's underrated, it just attracts a different crowd from the usual expat community, mainly locals and South-Asian tourists. Except for the events the place is almost never crowded, pleasantly lively at best. The mall is connected to Home Plus and other supermarkets that makes it suitable for family outings. It has some of the popular clothing stores and some alternative and luxury ones as well. You can also buy cosmetics here, of course. The variety of the eateries is probably the best thing about this mall; you can choose from western, Korean and Japanese cuisine here. They're scattered all over the mall, however, all the cheap Korean restaurants seem to be concentrated in an alley on floor B1. It has a few nice cozy coffee shops too. I personally like to spend time here alone. It's especially beautiful on sunny days. The architecture is also worthy of note."
Underrated - worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood,"A well missed mall in Seoul. If you should find yourself in the area, with time to spare - it really is worth a visit."
"Small, but fun Mall","There are few places to shop and few good places to eat. It is located right next to Hapjoeng Station and easy to access.Once inside you will need some time to find how to move around. The place is built in style of a maze so you might get lost moving up and down, but after a while you'll be used to the place. The Umbrella Roof is cute"
New big but not much to do!,"It is a landmark in the Hapjeong area, newly built towering over most other buildings in the area. + New chic restaurants and shops (shoes, cosmetics, food candles and design, cinema).+ Great facilities !+ Right next to Hapjeong station!- Not so much to do only has about 3 floors and most of it is for food. If you are looking for genuine Korean food don't come here. - A bit expensive."
