Best Lifestyle Store in Seoul,"The giant Kyobo Book Store in Gwanghwamun stocks great books, music and stationery. For those of you who still music in palpable form, the Hottracks concessionaire has an amazing collection of CDs, DVDs and LPs. Its classical collection is particularly impressive and it stocks many hard-to-find CDs and LPs of Korean classical artistes like Kun Woo Paik and Yeol Eun Son. Its English books selection is small but well stocked. It also has an incredible array of stationery concessionaires who stock a great collection of fountain pens, inks, papers, notebooks and stationery you never thought you needed. For those who are into personalised music, there is an extensive selection of headphones and bluetooth streaming devices. You could spend a whole day there since there is also a restaurant and cafe within the bookstore itself."
Books Books Books,"Kyobo is a chain, so there are stores all over Seoul, but the Gwanghwamun location is my favorite. They sell books and CDs, which reminds me of what the States used to have in the Borders chains, along with even more stuff. There are cafes and restaurants inside, too. There are sections for foreign languages and, depending on your language, there are likely specialty shops elsewhere that will better serve you. The English section is small, but has great editions, like Oxfords World’s Classics, at cheap prices. The literary selection tends to be canonical, but the staff also has a large section devoted to best-sellers and newly published material, most of which is non-fiction, that is a sort of Korean-American cultural filter. There are always lots of families here and people milling about, reading, gathering books, enmeshed in the written word and the real world. Take some time here, slow down, observe, read something, think a few connected thoughts, have something to eat or drink...and enjoy. Over the past five or six years, there has been lots of renovation in the areas adjacent, particularly with high end restaurants and shops behind Kyobo and to the left. Jongno has remained the same and the Gwanghwamun Gwangjang is historical. Several years ago the Korean people protested then President Park Geun-Hye with candlelight vigils and songs on the square, every Saturday, for months. These protests began with small numbers that grew into the thousands, and arguably millions. These protests were part of the success in the removal of Park (December, 2016) and were amazing representations of the civil, non-violent assemblage of people for a cause. Democracies around the world would do well to follow in these Korean footsteps."
Worth A Visit,"This is a huge bookstore, connected to the Gwanghwamun metro station. A must visit for those who likes books, although mostly Korean books. There is also an English section. Do check out their interesting stationery items as well."
"If you love books, don't miss this!","Kyobo bookstore in Jongno-gu (near Gwanghwamun station) is a must-visit for anyone with a passion for books and simply spending time in bookstores. This particular branch (there are others dotted around the city) is, I believe, the largest. It has a vast collection of books in Korean, and sections for a number of other languages, with quite a good selection of books in English. The store also has a stationery section, puzzles and a cafe, and is surrounded by a number of other shops. Unlike so many bookstores these days, Kyobo allows you to spend time simply sitting on the provided comfortable benches, and reading. You'll find the store in the basement, accessible from the station."
If only there were more stores like this,"Without doubt the biggest book store I’ve ever seen, including Barnes & Nobel in the USA.Small English section, but were in Korea.Truly amazing to see how the experience is developed, the cafes, the associated offerings, eg Mont Blanc store. Retail at its best"
Fantastic Bookstore,"This is a big bookstore with many sections. We spent well over an hour in the stationery section alone. Super cute gift items. It's great to see so many people sitting in chairs or standing reading books. This place is a must visit for book lovers, even if you can't read Korean."
Huge book store,"Probably biggest book store what I've seen. Not only books but parfumes, DVD and CD, electronics, coffee shop etc. Basically you can spent whole day in this book store without get bored. Also goid selection of English language books available. "
Kyobo Book Store,"There is a huge variety of books here, in fact same as similar shops everywhere in the world. Possible to find books in English, one good plus. For stationary materials, it is better and cheaper to enter smaller shops specific for stationary. You will lose much less time. Same is valid for other goods such as souvenirs, wallets, bags, toys, etc. If you want to buy only book and have specific list, enter and buy. Otherwise you can become crazy in crowd. As a summary, other than huge variety of books, nothing special."
Ginormous Book Store!,"This Book Store is amazing! It's located at the Basement of the Kyobo Building. The person at the Information Counter was so helpful and efficient. She gave me a print out based on the info which I gave her (Book Titles & ISBN Numbers) in order for me to locate the books that I was looking for. As I was pressed for time, I went to the designated location but was too overwhelmed andI decided to ask their Book Concierge Counter for assistance. The lady was so helpful and found the books which I was looking for very quickly. If you love books, this is a must place to visit! I will definitely go again and spend at least a day in this Book Store!"
Seoul’s 誠品,I stumbled on this while walking out of the Gwanghwamun subway station and was amazed at the range of books and local crowd on a Sunday morning. The English section is located on a corner closer to the cafe. It is one of the largest I have seen in Seoul as English books are not common. Especially for literature on Korean art and culture published by the national cultural institute. There is also a comprehensive list of titles published by Tuttle books on Korean national identity and history. There are also titles on the Korean War as well as current works on North Korea. The store also has a nice cafe and sections devoted to stationery and fine writing instruments. I wish there would be more such stores in Singapore as this reflects the knowledge seeking identity of a nation and I am happy that print is still king in some places. 
Excellent variety !,"We were recommended to visit the bookstore and music store by the Tourist Information Center (I would recommend you to ask them for advice - superb service). We were looking for some KPop albums as well as some specific stationery. Kyoto bookstore (with HotTracks music store inside) are located at the basement and once you get there, you will be amazed. Through costs is relatively more expensive than Malaysia for the same items, there are just a wide variety of things not seen else where - books, Stationeries, music albums."
Huge bookstore like Taipei’s Eslite ,"This bookstore could give Taipei’s Eslite a run for its money. It’s really big with everything from books and stationery to music and lifestyle items and gadgets. Quite a wide selection of English books too. But it was really really crowded on a Sunday afternoon. Great place for browsing and buying, but not so much for hanging out and reading. "
"Amazing bookstore, I could literally move there","Lovely bookstore - you can just find almost anything you need. I went there for a TOPIK book. But also there is an unspeakable number and shape of post it and other sorts of stickers which I also find amazing along with the kids. Staff is friendly and helpful. There is a restaurant there, if you get hungry after having browsed all the stuff. Every time I come to Korea I visit the bookstore, I like it this much. "
Huge,"I made it a point to go there each time I visit Seoul. One of the main reasons was to buy the same book in Singapore, it cost almost three times as much as the amount I paid in Korea. I usually get the Korean language books such as the ones published by TTLK books as they sell it online in USD excluding shipping cost.I also like to look at the various merchandise ranging from stationery to audio accessories and sometimes, you may get good buys."
Great bookstore ,I always make it a point to stop by and inhale the scent of new books. It's a bit short on space to sit and read but the atmosphere is cozy and the staff very helpful. Plus it's right of the square. Great location 
HUGE!,"For me as a book lover, this place is a must visit regardless if they mostly have Korean books, it;s just a MUST VISIT. They even have Japanese selection of books! Though the English section was I guess not that big but there is! You can see almost everything in this huge bookstore, they got the record bar and gadget section and so on, the place is not much of an English friendly place though, but we managed by talking to some customers they are very helpful when it comes to speaking English."
great bookstore,"it's huge! they have also a nice selection in English, I really liked the atmosphere. if your looking for something to read - that is definitely the place!"
Mostly Korean Books - But definitely a happening place,"Most of the selection caters to Korean Readers. That being said the vibe and atmosphere of the place is great. there are several coffee shops and reading tables that make it worthwhile to hang out here. the crowd is a pleasant mix between young professionals and calmer older clientele who is there to relax/read. Children's english section is small - as is grown up english section - but there seems to be a good selection. Well curated and nice. There are also 'Artbox' stationery, office supplies and art supplies areas. that are interesting to explore."
Greatest bookstore in Korea,"The selection of English fiction has greatly improved but still has a long way to go before it will compare with an English speaking country. It does however have a really wide selection of Teaching materials for various languages.The stationery variety available is unbelievable. Whatever your heart desires you will find here. There are also many other things available from jewellery to dolls to music/cds and lots more, too many things to even remember.There is also a wonderfully clean toilet available plus a mothers room.A restaurant and a coffee/juice shop is also there with a fairly large amount of seating. All in all, it is somewhere you can happily spend an afternoon. You will also find many students sitting there reading books they can't afford to buy."
All you could imagine and more ,So much to choose from Great feel Huge wooden table to read at Lots of variety and English books available too 
Nice children books,"I'm a one week trip in Seoul and was looking for English books for my baby. I found this place on nearby attractions on TA's app. It's literally a hidden treasure, as it's located in the basement of a huge skyscraper. They have a huge collection of books and a section for children in English. I bought six beautiful books for my child. I recommend a visit, as the surrounding is also nice with different eateries and cafes. "
Do we have anywhere better than Kyobo ? I don't think so,"I spent my best time in Kyobo when I was student in Korea in 2013-2014 one of best places you should visit if you love books belive me or not, for me the first place I should find in each city is its first and best books store, so for Seoul this is the best one."
A nice hideout from heat and rain,"This place is more than a book store. It is more like a mini-shopping center where you can find not only stationery, books, electrical appliances, gadgets but also toys and bags (Hottracks is inside too). They provide small benches here and there for customers who like to linger around for a little bit. If you are hungry, there is a food court.The store is definitely an excellent place to fend off the afternoon heat and torrential rains. It could get really crowded because of that and also the fact that it is connected to the subway. I have also been to the one in Daegu, too. The Daegu store is smaller and not as crowded. If you decide to do some serious shopping there, make sure that you bring your passport with you for the instant tax returns / credits (spending 30000 won at one time). It would be nice if they have a coffee shop there, just like the one in Barnes and Noble."
Best Place for Book Lover,"The branch in Gwanghwamun is the biggest in the country. From Gwanghwamun metro station you just need to follow the directions because the bookstore also located underground near the station. They have wide range collections of book. Mainly, of course in Korean but their imported or foreign language book sections are okay and quite satisfying. For K-Pop lovers, you can explore the CD and music sections to get the latest K-Pop albums. Korean art-supply store, ARTBOX also available inside the Kyobo. ARTBOX and Kyobo have great collections of office supplies, stationery, and cute stuffs so don't forget to check them out. You can stuff yourself as cafes and restaurants also available with full selections of food. In conclusion, this place is just amazing and definitely time killer! Especially if you are a book lover, I bet you would spend hours here (in my case, I spent 5 hours :D). Make sure to check Kyobo out when you visit Gwanghwamun Square!"
Very big book store,Kyobo book store has been around in Seoul for many years. There are many varieties of books available in the store either in local Korean or English language. You will feel very peaceful inside the store.
The Warmest Underground Location in Seoul,"If you love books and you're in Seoul: Go to Kyobo.I used to looove going here to buy books since I was a kid. Unfortunately, I feel that with the passing of time the foreign book section is subtly becoming smaller and smaller... but nevertheless, it's still the best choice to browse through and buy books. If you are to frequent your visits to the bookstore or if you live in Seoul, I'd recommend getting a Kyobocard for benefits and discounts. They have a big stationery shop and a cafeteria/dining area within the bookstore in the Kyobo Bookstore."
Huge bookstore,"The bookstore is real huge and lotsa book lovers, we don't have such reading culture in Singapore. I am learning basic Korean and don't know where to start. So I went to information counter and asked. They direct me to section F11. I found very interesting Korean comics that teaches daily Korean usage that can't find in textbooks. There is also a section on CD. All the K-pop songs can be found here. Found some Korean songs that I really like. "
Love This Place,"Who doesn't love a good bookstore? The Kyobo Bookstore has been around since . . .well, forever, it seems, and it still pulls me in every time I visit Seoul. The selection of books in Korean is vast, but there is also a very good selection of books in English, both fiction and non-fiction. I never have any difficulty finding something. But even if you are not in the mood to buy, this is an excellent place to kill some time.They have increased the floor space devoted to things like stationery and gifts over the years, but books are still at the heart of what they offer. The stationery section is substantial, and anyone should be able to find something here, from Moleskine notebooks to cutesy pens to everything in between. There is also a mini food court in the corner where I had a surprisingly good bowl of bibimbap (stainless steel bowl, sadly, not stone). There are lots of places to sit in the book area, and pretty much every one one of them was filled with someone reading a book (or doing something on their phone). I can't say how many books were being bought (except the ones I bought), but there was certainly a lot of reading activity going on. The vibe in the Kyobo Bookstore is always a lively one. It has a good feel, a good selection of books and other merchandise, and a good location. Check it out."
Brilliant,Beautiful sensual aroma when you walk in makes you immediately warm to this place. Besides large VBou selection of books there's CDs DVDs hifi gear gifts etc and a cafe and restaurant.
My favorite place in Korea!,"I think this the the one of the biggest book store in the world, really! Whenever I visit Korea, I never fail to visit this bookstore because, literally I could start to swim in the enormous stream of tens of thousands of books. You will be able to find any book you want, name it. And it has a special place for kids also where they can really enjoy with their own books. And, yes it is accompanied with nice cozy cafes also. It is just at the center of Seoul Metropolitan City, very near to the Kyoungbok Palace, which is another 'must-see' attraction. I recommend!"
Worth A Visit If You Love Books & Stationery,"Love this bookstore! You could literally stay there for the whole day, browsing books, magazines, gadgets, music, stationary, interesting knock knacks and toys. The range of English books is adequate, you could have fun browsing through books of other languages too, and especially so if you understand Korean, the range is just amazing! There are lots of seats around the bookstore and it can get pretty packed, but the place is never rowdy or annoyingly noisy, maybe because very the bookstore is very spacious with always enough space for everyone. In the vicinity of the bookstore, there are a couple of food options like a very popular restaurant serving Italian food like pasta and pizza with snaking queues. We had a Korean style hot plate and hot pot and it was affordable and delicious! I would definitely return when I go to Korea. "
편안한 서점,"This is biggest book store in kwanghwamoon seoul. In kyobo bookstore ,you could seat chair or floor and read the book ,what you want, comfortably.also many things to see and buy If you feel hungry or thirsty you can find food court. quite good place to spend time and around kyobo many restaurants and cafe "
Excelent book store,"Kyobo book store is one of the biggest book store I know worldwide. It offers place to read and a wide range of book in English, Spanish and French. From fiction to business books. Prices are also very good, cause it has good promotions all the time. "
Big bookstore in Seoul,"Kyobo Book Store was a big book store in Gwanghwamun, I went there by subway. There were a lot of tourist attractions around the area, hence after visiting the bookstore, I went sight seeing."
Nice and tons of stationery,"It is the place to see how much people in Seoul love to read! Many cute stationery and gifts to buy, too."
massive bookstore,"we pop in after visiting Gwanghwamun Square and this place is massive!for singaporeans, you can relate it to kinokuniya (jap bookstore) that we have in sg and kyobo is almost as big as kino or maybe kyobo is twice in size?there are a wide array of books, mostly in korean though, there is some english books and magazines around.but the thing i'm keen is the vast variety of stationery they have! As i'm a part time student so i naturally have a soft spot to their cute monthly calendars, stickers, korean cartoon related stationery, pens, etc. they are good for souvenirs if you have friends who are still studying or working in office.Especially in the chilling autumn weather, Kyobo also sell heatpack at 500won each (~SGD $0.60) and this could last about 10 hours. as a tropical kid, i really cannot stand cold weather, so i bought 10 packets of heatpack at one shot. ^ ^ the cashier did look at me strangely though..*i seriously think korea heatpack is much larger, warmer & better than those i bought from Singapore Daiso. So this could be an alternative for those looking for heatpack in Korea.come in to take a look and absorb the books culture in korea. i feel this place kinda brings me closer to being a part of korea, than being just a tourist"
Bookstores are a rarity these days in the US...but not in Korea!,"I love Kyobo bookstore because they have a GIGANTIC selection of books, music, stationary, games/toys, etc...you really could spend all day here if you enjoy books. I'm not a fan of the e-reader. I like the feel of turning a page. If you share this feeling, venture into a Kyobo (it's a chain) the next time you're in Korea. Bookstores are a dying industry, at least where I live, so it's truly nice to be in a place with stacks and stacks of books covering a wide range of topics. All the Kyobo bookstores I've been to, including this one at the edge of Gwanghwamun Square, has multiple levels so be sure to visit each level to pick up a book and some kpop CDs and/or stationary to keep you entertained during your travels! "
Great place to spend time,"That's a great place to spend hours and hours. They have tons of books of all areas, korean, japanese, chinese, english and even other languages. They also have a great magazine section. There's also right around there - this is not Kyobo, but it's right in there, I even got lost in the boundaries lol- a great stationary shop, i guess my favorite in Seoul; a CD/DVD store in case you are interested in some films or some kpop stuff; some small electronic shop (i bought instant films there); a cosmetic store... it's all there! Restrooms and water fonts are clean and big - as they usually are in Seoul, actually. And, what surprised me the most, there's a quite small food court, but very efficient, with a little more than a dozen choices of dishes, my friend and I tried some of them and they were all delicious! There's also a baskin robbins for some dessert, a dunkin' donuts and some coffee shop I don't remember which. It's all set for you to spend all day drowned in books, or even if you are coming for any of the attractions in gwanghwamun and decided to take a time off to chill a little bit."
Love this store,"This store is huge. It also has a fairly extensive range of books written in English. I love browsing through their classic's section. I was so excited the last time I went, because Jules Verne's 'around the world in 80 days' was on sale for 3,000￦. "
Looking for books but found so much more,This review is for Gangnam location since I couldn't find one on the trip advisor. We were looking for a couple of books for our kids to learn Korean but found so much more. They have great deals and amount on toys and many small things for gift ideas. Kids enjoyed looking around and throughly enjoyed about 1 to 2 hrs there.
Books and other things,"I love wandering through this book store. The have a decent section of English books and around the outside you can find anything from pens and notebooks to candles, watches, and cool little knickknacks."
Scenes from a reader's life in Seoul,"Huge store in the basement of a building just called Kyobo( that's the name of Korea's biggest bookseller as well as the life insurance company name you see outside the building. If you are fond of reading or sensing how or what another country reads, head to this store. The poetry section and the Korean movies with English subtitles section might disappoint, but all else is great. One can spend a few hours in there, especially with restrooms, cafe, music, stationery section and some other random cool stuff. If you are a native English speaker, get ready to head to the FOREIGN BOOKS section of this bookstore and worry not, their e-kiosks type in English and Korean and they have English speaking Koreans as the Book Concierge."
Very huge,so love..this place....many many books and also other little stalls inside the book store. More korean language book as well. A huge area just for stationeries as well... 
Time flies when I go to Kyobo,"This is one of my favorite places when I visit Seoul (This is my 4th visit). I bought lovely stationary items, CDs and good books. 1 hr is not enough."
"""HEAVEN!!!""","The Kyobo book is a great place to spend your time. Not only do they sell books, you can find stationary stores, home goods, souvenirs, a cafeteria and more inside it. It's also in the Middle of Seoul, so the transportation is really good. And, since it's near Gwanghwamun, after you check out Kyobo, you can go and see a Traditional Korean Palace."
How to spend 3 amazing hours and spend a lot!,"There's a myriad of stationary, home goods and, of course, books. It's an excellent place to buy a nice souvenir from Korea, a local cookbook in English, beautiful stationary (there is a lot, a LOT, it's a heaven for stationary lovers). You can have a nice coffee while enjoying the books you just bought. It's a walking distance from the castle and connected to the metro station. If you are a book lover you can't miss this spot!"
More than just a bookstore.....,"I always make a visit to the bookstores of any city I visit, because I am keen to collect cookbooks written in English by locals. Most of these are usually not available on Amazon or other online bookstores.Kyobo's outlet at Gwanghwamun didn't disappoint. It's large and sprawling, but most of the books are Korean, which is to be expected. As with most brick and mortar bookstores these days, they have cafes, retailers selling pens, art supplies, bags and others to provide some added attraction. They have a respectable English cookbook collection, but also a selection of books on Korean topics in English. There were some locally written cookbooks, and they looked interesting because several of them were written by well known culinary academics. When I was there in November, they had a promotion on Japanese books and you can enjoy a discount on them. They had also put up a nice display featuring a mix of Japanese cookbooks. I really like this feature.What I enjoyed about the bookstore was the chairs and benches they had provided within the store to allow people to browse their selections. There are staff there who speak simple English. They have a green practice of charging for carrier bags (which is good).I'd go back there to check out the cookbooks again. Kyobo is more like Eslite in Taipei (another fabulous bookstore) in its offerings of books and other related products. Kinokuniya in Tokyo is more like the traditional bookstore with a lot more focus on providing books and less on other goods. All are great bookstores, and deserve visits by book lovers."
The biggest book store of South Korea ,"As a book store ,there are many shopping things for you.However there also the best book store in South Korea because of so many books for everyone.And Korean people take care of their children so much that many children with their parents here.Some foreigners also here to buy books,English books and others.All the way,you can come here to find your book."
Paradise for book lovers^^,It's a really huge book store. I think you will need 2 or more day to observe this place well. When i first time came there i was so impressed by it's size because we don't have such HUGE bookstores in our country. Like this place 
Kyobo + Seoul = Only the best fun ever...,"I haven't seen the tripadvisor Kyobo link for Gagnam, so this is a review for the Gangnam location. It's attached directly to Sinnohyeon Subway Station. This place is huge. Like pretty big...huge. If you've ever seen a Virgin Records store or similar, that's what I would compare Kyobo to. I don't speak the language, but that's okay. I just visited to be around books--and there were many! The stationery portion is way better than I've seen in any Barnes & Noble in the U.S. It has items for kids and ""grown up crayons"" for adults. They even had an art section with oil paints, luxury counters selling special writing tools (Mont Blanc, Parker, Faber-Castell), and other mini-vendors selling accessories. I saw a plethora of headphones from Shute, personal speakers from Ultimate Ears, and nice sales as well. The prices are out of this world great, and customer service was levels above what I've seen in most stores in any country. For instance, I was approached quite a few times with a basket to unload all the trinkets I'd been collecting in my hands. I will definitely be going to the Kyobo in Gwanghamun, but one shouldn't rest in their laurels to see the one in Gangnam. Not to mention, that strip in the area is international and fun to people watch. Most customers of the nearby California Pizza Kitchen had bad from Kyobo. Go!"
More than a Bookstore,Spent a whole afternoon in the book store. Has best stationery items. I like the reading area very much. It is part of the places to visit every time I am in Seoul.
Wow!,"This book store is massive! If you are looking for English books, come here. The selection is incredible. New releases to classics, cooking to text books, it's all here. For such a massive store it was interesting the location is not more clear. There is a small sign directing you to B1 at the lobby of the building. "
Great variety of choices,"Pros: Great variety of books.You can shop for souvenirs, notebooks, CDs, DVDs, toys and of course books... written in Korean but also in English, French, Spanish etc.Cons: In the basement of the massive headquerter of Kyobo Building."
Massive! The next level of bookstores!,"This bookstore is unbelievable. It connects to the subway purple line #5 at Gwanghwamun Station. If you are a book worm, stationary lover, music enthusiast, or just plain curious about how big a bookstore can really be I recommend coming here. They have books for everything and also provides an exceptional English section of books. The stationary is so unique and fun while the music section has a great layout and options to pick from. Relax and enjoy the Cafe inside after you've looked around (it gets tiring as there are tons of people there) and then stroll through all the random goods they sell. Definitely a place to stop through before going to Gwanghwamun square and Gyeongbokgung Palace (which are at the same stations). Not your typical bookstore!"
"Amazing bookstore and more (stationery, CDs, booklovers gifts,…)","Whether you speak Korean or not (do not panic, there is a massive foreign books selection, especially in English) this establishment is a real must for book lovers.Obviously 60% of the bookstore is made by Korean titles, but even then, the English and other languages sections are well fed. Besides, there is a incredible huge stationery section with plenty of notebooks ( with much more diversity than the sheer Moleskine you find in any bookstore); and the Hot tracks, a CD and DVD store.It is a pity this bookstore is in the basement of a massive building and not facing the street. Besides, the signalling to get to the bookstore is virtually non existent. But anyhow, a very recommendable stop in a very central location in near the palace Gyeongbokgung."
Awesome! Huge,Gotta conpare the size to Barnes and Noble back home...this place is huge and has it all! I usually go to the kyobo bookstore in Jamsil station which is great too! 
The best bookstore in Korea!,"The sheer size of this place is amazing huge! It has all kinds of books, ststionary and everything else you would expect to find in a bookstore. If you love books you have to come here!My problem was that when I was there no one spoke English, even the lady who was stationed at the English speakig desk couldn't spwak English. And the prices are a bit high. Otherwise it is the place to buy books in Korea! "
Very big books & stationary store !!!,"If you are ""Books & Stationary Lover"", don't miss this place. There are a lot of books & stationary to buy. All of the stationary are good quality and not expensive. A lot of cute & lovely things to bring back home. "
Wide variety of English books and lots of nice stationery,Huge bookstore with a large English section. Lots and lots of nice stationery. There are also cafes and food outlets within the bookstore. Enjoyable experience. 
books and beyond,"There's definitely not enough signs for the bookstore from the outside, but it definitely worth looking for (underground). Plenty of books in foreign languages and wide variety of stationery brands. Awesome bathroom too =)))"
Books galore,"This is by far the most popular and well known bookstore in Korea. It takes up an entire lower floor of a building. If you don't read Korea, they do have a huge selection of Korean to English and other language translated section."
