Good ride,The ride in Namsan cable car provide a great view of Seoul when you are riding up and down. Would suggest to take the cable car during night as the view is great.
Wonderful view of the city,This cable car ride ends with a beautiful view of old and new seoul. It's a shirt 3 minute ride but the niew from the top is beautiful.
"Few hours to kill, nothing better.","Enjoyed the trip to Seoul Tower via cable car. Likely queueing for cable car but moves well and will let you know queueing time when purchasing ticket. Lovely views of the city, clear blue sky’s. If traveling with partner bring a lock! "
Short,Shortest way to reach namsan park or tower is to use the cable car. It's a short ride to the top of the hill.
Expensive and not worth it,Short ride and nothing to see. Yet we paid so much. Disappointed....Truly disappointed with the experience. Better to take a bus or taxi up than the cable car.
Good but loads of people to a car,We thought the easiest and most fun way of getting to the top of the hill and the tower! They do cram you in but it’s ok you can still move at least to bring your arms up to take a photo. The views are cool enough. They have windows just around the top half of the car.
Disappointing and Expensive,"I took the cable car down with my 3 year old son (we walked up), and we looked forward to the views, but the queues are long, the staff are pretty rude, and you’re rammed in to the cars. It’s pure luck if you’re next to a window with enough room to get your camera out and take a photo. It’s definitely not worth the money (everyone over 3 pays). The walk up was really lovely - even on a warm-ish day in late May. There are also several buses that run you up to the Tower, which I’d definitely recommend over the cable car. I wish we’d walked back down."
Sum up of seoul city! Read till end for surprise:),"You probably see a lot reviews saying packed cable car, can't see much etc. Well cause you expecting it at the wrong place!Not there yet.. The aim getting Namsan Cable Car is to reach at the top, Namsan Tower. And it is fine if you can hardly see the view along the way cause the best view is on the top later! Breathtaking view and have few fav spots for your instagram feed. hehe. Got convenience store, cafe & souvenir shops too upthere. But i suggest you can packed your own sandwich then. save! haha.Tips: Personally I highly suggest you guys to buy one way ticket. Go for a walk when going down from the top. Another forgetful view and hidden insta spots beside the love locks.LOL. thank me later!"
Worth the visit on a sunny spring day ,"Gone up and down the hill by cable car. They charge a small fee to use it which was all acceptable. We booked a return so we could also get back down. The cabin was not air conditioned and they stuff quite a lot of ppl into the cabin. But it’s only a 3 min ride. We didn’t have to Quere please note this. Up the hill there are love locks - like the ones in Paris where u can leave a message and then seal it at the fence. Nice idea . You can Bring your pwn lock or buy one locally. You find the tower, food and drinks nice views over the city and some shows up there. Well worth the visit!Definitely recommend!!"
Bonding time with my family,"First time in this place, and we finally get to see all these padlocks that we see in a lot of k-dramas. Perfect cool weather this time of the year! "
Not an option,"Pay 7$ just to be pressed inside the cabin with lots of people after a big line to enter. You can hardly move, forget about taking photos. My advice is to take a bus (see on naver map: 02, 03, 05) to get there, they're going from all main places nearby, it's cheaper and even more comfortable. "
Love queing its for you,"We spent 50 minutes cramped in a line with coughing wheezing sweaty Koreans waiting for a cable car to the Seoul tower. Believe me it's not worth the hassle or stress.No air conditioning and this is only April. God help people when the Sumner arrives. All because of a technical fault, which sums up Korea. Promises so much delivers little.You are then crammed into a small box for the 2 minute trip and are greeted by a long queue that you will have to join to get back down. All this to go up Seoul Tower where you cannot see out off if the Sun is shining as the windows have not been cleaned for years.Complete waste of time and money, which sums up Seoul."
Not that good,The distance of boarding to the nearest metro station is far. You will need to walk up hill.They will squeeze everybody in one car. Literally pack. There wont be enough space to even take pictures.
"Convenient cable-car, but not worth a visit in itself","The cable-car is convenient, and not particularly expensive, however not worth a visit in itself, and if steps or time are not a problem (of if the line is long), I would recommend just taking the stairs up to the N-Tower at the top of the hill, which makes for a very nice stroll."
Too crowded for 1 cable car,This cable car we must stand up with tons of people... not the same with the BBF movies... lil bit disappointed
Wheelchair Access,"This visit to Namsan, I noticed that there were lift access for wheelchair visitors which is good knowledge if we were to bring parents next round!Autumn is one of the most beautiful periods to visit."
Highly recommended transport to go Namsam,Firstly is to enjoy the city view of Myeongdong city - take a free slanted lift from ground to Cable Car station (foot of Namsan)Slanted lift station is about 8~10 minutes walk from Myeongdong station.Secondly is the mid~high view of colourful forest along the ride in Cable Car.Thirdly is from the highest view on Namsam.It’s also recommended to take stairs from cable car station (foot of Namsam) to ground... Enjoy the last beautiful scene under fresh air in the city ^ ^
Exciting Way to Reach The Top,"The queue was long but it was fast-moving. When we were able to finall ride in the Cable Car, it was thrilling to see the view of Seoul from the top. Going down, it wasn't that long for the queue anymore, and the city lights were very cool to stare at while the machine is going down the line."
Average ,"The cable is not a must do. I would say to think of it as a way to get to the top but not necessarily a must do activity. There doesn’t seem to have more than two carts running at a time,so I can imagine at peaks times the line will be very long. They pack way too many people onto one cart so the journey is not enjoyable and you might not even get a decent view to look out. I would recommend the cable car if you just want a way to get up to the top but don’t expect anything special. If I was to go again,I would either walk up or take the bus. "
Easy way to get to the top of Namsan,"We got the cable car to the top of Namsan. We walked from the Myeongdong metro station & there were plenty of street signs that pointed the way to the cable car. We got there at 9:55am, bought our tickets and were on the first cable car at 10:00am. Definitely recommend going at opening time to beat the queue. The cable car has good views, it's a convenient way to get up the mountain and we're glad we did it, but it's not a must-see attraction like the peak tram in Hong Kong."
If You Have Time,"Like most large cities, cable car attractions are expensive and if you enjoy taking in the cityscape without wasting time and energy, the Namsan Cable Car is recommended. Otherwise, you may hike or take an alternative but longer route to get to the top."
If you're lazy or unfit this is the best way to the N Seoul Tower.,"I was gallivanting about all over Seoul one day recently and decided that as it was so sunny and clear then I should take a look at the city from a high point - the North Seoul Tower, for example. I got close and realised that it could be quite a climb to the top of the Namsan hill on which the Tower is perched. Then I spied the signs to the cable car so decided to take the lazy option and headed over to the entrance. For the princely sum of 9.500 Won an adult can purchase a return ticket on this contraption which can, apparently transport 50 (small) people. Actually the ride is over quite quickly - I guess around 5 minutes and it's not the optimal place to enjoy the views. But I was grateful to avoid an arduous climb. Only later I discovered that you can also take a bus to the Tower which I guess is considerably more economic. Oh, well..."
Amazing city views,Well worth it! Nice up close view of the tower and amazing view of the city. Come just before sunset for a breath taking view. The city lights at night is also amazing. The cable car ride is usually full pack so do not expect the ride to be a scenic ride. It's just a ride to your final destination.
One of the ride one must do in Seoul,"We went to this lovely Cable Car ride coming down.It is perfect way to see the beautiful city of Seoul sky line.Only issue is ,it done so quickly and have to be lucky to have clear day.We had some cloudy day.You can do either going up or down."
Fastest way to N seoul tower,It’s the fastest way to N seoul tower. located at the bottom of the hill. Cable car can accommodate about 50 pax per trip. Pay round trip ticket if you opt to use it going back down. Nice view to the city while on transit.
Convenient way to get to N Seoul Tower and Namsan Park,"Namsan Cable Car is the easiest and fastest way for you to visit N Seoul Tower. It is located 10 to 20 minutes walk away from Myeongdong area and the ticket is quite affordable at 8,500 won for adult return trip.The cable car journey however is short, at around 10 minutes journey if I am not mistaken and takes you straight to the foot of N Seoul Tower. Quite a seamless experience but do take note that the cable car is not operational during bad weather. Nothing really special except as a convenient way to visit Seoul Tower and Namsan Park."
Romantic night view to and from Namsan Tower,"(I say romantic but I went with my friends so that we could go to Namsan Tower. ) We went around 7:00 PM from Myeongdong Station. We noticed it was very popular with couples. Going at night is better than day time to see the city lights I think. It was worth it for us because we had already been shopping for hours in Myeongdong and walking to the cable car station was a very steep 15 minute walk uphill from Myeongdong Station Exit 2 or 3. When you buy the ticket for the cable car, there is a short line to get inside the cable cars. Beware the long line for the ride back at night."
Scenic Way to N Seoul Tower,"Roundtrip ticket costs 8500 Won. I walked from my hotel in Myeongdong to the Namsan Cable Car station. It was a bit of a walk uphill since the Namsan Outdoor Escalator wasn’t working. There was no air conditioning in the cable car. It was crowded going up but it wasn’t crowded going down. Once the cable car reached the top, you still need to walk up several flights of steps to the N Seoul Tower. The cable car ride was about 3 minutes long."
Great views!,This is definitely not to be missed if you are in Seoul! The views are spectacular and there are lots of things to see and do - we even tried VR for the first time!
Taxi is convenient,We took a taxi from Itaewon straight to the Cable Car station as we heard it's a very long walk uphill. It was a weekday and there was no queue. The waiting area was air-conditioned so that wasnt too bad. Strollers have to be folded while you are in the cable car. Each time a ride can fit about 20 people. 
Cable Cars are the easy way to the top,"I have walked up the hill to the Namsan tower before. In fact, I walked it several times before trying the cable cars. The cable cars are the way to go! There are still many steps to go up after getting off the cable car. If you are not use to walking uphill on a steep incline you will want to wait for the cable car. It also offers very scenic views to the top."
Caution when using the shuttle from Myeong-dong,"If exiting at the Myeong-dong metro station, exit via exit 1 (NOT 7/8!!!) and wait on the sidewalk. The shuttle bus stop is NOT signposted. "
Good view and awesome ride!,"Great view from Namsan cable car, good ride and shortest way up to continue your walk to seoul tower"
Good ride,"Namsan cable car is the best way to get to tje Namsan seoul tower if you do not want to get tired. A round trip fare of 8,500kw for adult and 5,500 for kids and 6,000 for single journey. See picture for reference. If you are going to try this on holidays, you will experience a long time of waiting for the ride. We tried it during childrens day and we waited for about 1 hour. Probably if it is not holiday or weekend, only few people will ride. About 3 or 4 min of ride and you will enjoy the cable car and the beautiful view of seoul. "
No hiking shoes? Tram it!,"Great price, well maintained, efficient staff. Save your steps for more sight-seeing while in Seoul."
No better way to see the mountain in fall or spring colors,"While the line for the cable car can be long & crowded, it is worth the wait for the panoramic views of Namsan. Go during the peak of fall foliage or spring cherry blossoms for the best views! Make sure to check the visibility index before you go."
Good to try when Namsan has a great view,"The old cable car which represents Namsan and Seoul.It's nothing special comparing to brand new ones in the country.But, visitors would better try when Namsan is covered with snow, cherry blossoms or fall foliages.Considering the distance, people may complain it's expensive. But, it doesn't require lots of money anyway.Trying during Chuseok or Seolnal isn't recommended because there'll be a crazy number of people."
Very crowded,Took the cable car going up to N Seoul Tower. We were greeted with long lines. Rode the bus on our way back to Myeongdong which was easier. Don’t get the round trip tickets and take the bus on your way down.
Get there early,We arrived soon after they opened and had no wait to get in a cable car. For 8500 you get a return ride. Which on a cold spring day seemed more appealing than walking! Worth it if there is no wait. However on a warmer day I would walk the gentle slopes.
You will be faster by foot,When you are healthy and don't have kids or older people with you: Save your time and money and walk up the hill. You will wait at the queue longer than you need to walk up. And you save some money.
Namsan Cable Car,A short duration ride up to Namsan Park by this cable car is possible. Climbing up by walking is also possible. I guess cable car cost is a bit expensive.
Great views.,"We went in March so the queues were minimal. The tickets were relatively cheap (return ticket) but do not include entry to the tower (you buy this once you get to the top). The cable car trip lasts for about 2-3 minutes and the views were pretty amazing, you can see for miles! The love locks at the top of the hill by the tower are worth a visit, take your own with you though as they charge a lot if you want to buy one. The tower itself was quite pricey and the view from the LOTTE world tower is much better for a similar price. I can imagine that the walk down from the tower would be great, steep but enjoyable!Worth checking the weather before you head up there as if its windy the cable cars don't operate!"
Try it for the experience,"Namsan cable car is just a few walks away from Pacific Hotel, the road is quite uphill so I dont really suggest it to older people. We only took the trip going to N Seoul Tower (one way ticket), cause it's just a quick 3-4 min ride up and seeing Seoul's view once is good. BUT, please walk and admire the beautiful scenery once you go down from the Park, you'll see more. there's another photozone that's not crowded and closer to the view :)"
If you have the time and energy... walk.,"High price, long queue (often in the elements) and then crammed on to the vehicle worrying if the weight limit is exceeded, not my idea of a fun tourist attraction. They even charge a premium for car parking."
"Long waits, is it worth it?","Our accommodation was just a short walk from the Cable Car. We got there and it was long wait, 40 minutes, slowly progressing in the queue. There were time estimates provided when you first purchased tickets, so we were happy enough with that, to wait is an informed decision!Good views from the cable car at night. When you've walked all day, the cable car is the sensible option for getting to the Tower."
Citylights,"Hi guys, i just get back from seoul and since its still fresh in my memory, hopefully i can gives you all the detail of the ride. This cable car connect us to Namsan tower or you might find other name which is N Seoul tower, you need to come to Namsan oreumi elevator to get inline to get to Namsan cable car. May i inform you during winter you need to get your hotpack / coat and also patience ready since there will be long queues from entrance gate to namsan cable car. I go there at sunday night and my waiting time was 45 min for 5 min ride, while on the way back slightly less ( maybe because its already late). So if you have tight schedule pls consider the timing. So many attraction there at Namsan tower. Aside love lock site for your photo portfolio You can get package for your wishes attraction ( you can see in the ticketing). There was hellokitty island, observer deck, hanbok rental, gift shop n many other shop. Mine was hello kitty island and its cuteness overload although its quite expensive for small spaces (cost around usd 8) but fine with me. And the other i can tell you was the city light n the namsan tower itself, must have list on your photo portfolio."
The only way to see the heart of Seoul,"It's very connivence to have a better opion rather than walking the whole way beside it's very cheap( 6,700 won) per adult which is about 7 dollars consider the experience. The only thing we disliked is that the ""Cart"" location itself, it's pretty far to walk to there from the subway station but despite that the service is very good."
Coolest way to get to the tower!,"My sister and I had a crazy time trying to find this place. It is definitely accessible once you get off Myeongdong exit 4. There is a hotel I think is Pacific Hotel that sits between 2 roads, left and right. We decided to follow the advice of one of the reviews on here and go LEFT at the intersection, HOWEVER we regretted that decision quickly. We went up several steep hills and super steep streets that seemed to go on forever. We had to ask an elderly man for some help and thankfully my sister can speak some hangul so could communicate and he pointed us in the direction. We ended up at the top of the street and because we couldn't see anything that alluded to cable car but could see the tower, we proceeded to walk up 8 sets of stairs. I was frozen and about ready to throw up my dinner. By the time we got up to the stairs we saw the cable car going in the direction we just came from hahaha. We had to walk down and we saw that the cable car was at the top of the street. The ride only lasts a short while like my man, but it was so cool at night! The lights are EPIC. And I got a feel for one of my favourite kdramas Boys over Flowers as this was where Gu Jyn Pyo (LEE MIN HO) shot the scene with Jandi! Yass. Last admission was 10:30pm I think and we made it there around 10:15pm paying around $20AUD for a return trip. DO NOT GO LEFT AT THE INTERSECTION GUYS!!! Unless you want a cardio workout. Go RIGHT! Then go up the set of stairs and you will be right there!"
"Amazing view, go early to avoid the queue","We used Cable Car when we visited N Seoul Tower. The easiest way is just walk straight from Myeongdong exit 4 and turn to the left at the intersection. Then walk about 300 meters to Namsan Oreumi. Then you can use the elevator to reach Cable Car station. To avoid the long queue on weekend, you can go on Saturday morning. From the Cable Car, you can see the view of the city. "
"Namsan Cable Car, a scenic route to N Seoul Tower!","We took the Namsan Cable Car to N Seoul Tower. It was a bit of a walk from Myeongdong Station. Upon Seeing Price Hotel, we took the most direct route there."
Amazing view of the city,"U can walk up to the tower, I saw many people walking down on my way up from the cable car but the weather was so cold at that time. Plus the night view of the city from the cable car was a pretty one. "
fastest way to reach Namsan tower,i bought the round trip ticket for 2 person. It was a good view when heading to N tower. Good for take it especially when winter time.
Namsan Tower in Winter,"Two ways to get up there and is good to be there just before the sun set. Winter sunset about 4-5pm. You can take the cable car or taxi or drive if you rent a car. Note that the cable car fee is not the fee to the Namsan tower. Adult return ticket 8,500 won Adult one-way ticket 6,000 won Children return ticket 5,500 wonNamsan Tower ticket - 10,000 won for Adult. There is Hello Kitty place which you have to get a ticket too to enter. But its optional.Many eateries available at Namsan Tower. The view is Superp!. Nice place to chill. You don't have to go up the Namsan Tower if you don't want to. At the base of Namsan Tower is good enough to hang out and shoot some photos."
Go in the morning,"We visited on a late afternoon in Fall and the queue to purchase tickets was at least 1hr long and then another 30-45min to board the cable car which lasted less than 5min. So we decided to come back in the morning at 11am and lo and behold, there was no queue for boarding the cable car. There were only 2-3 cable cars in operation due to the short distance.Tickets purchase-able for the cable car has several different combinations such as return tickets, or tickets with meals at the italian restaurant etc.Also note that if visiting with the intention of riding the outdoor elevator to the cable car station form street level, the elevator is shut on Mondays and queues can get up to 45min wait. The alternate walk/climb from street level to cable car station is not that exhausting if taken at a relaxed pace. The climb is only 10-15min to get to the cable car station.Alternative method to get up to Namsan is hike or taxi."
Cool way to get to N Seoul tower,"Very cool way to go to N Seoul tower. The ride isn’t very long, and it’s also quite cheap. Would recommend to go here when it’s not so many people. "
Good views of Seoul from the cable car,"The Namsan Cable Car takes you up to the N Seoul Tower Complex. The cable cars give you an all round view of the city as you ascend to the mountain top. To get to the cable cars from street level at Namsan third tunnel, there is a funicular elevator that goes up the short distance to the cable car station – and this takes about two minutes. The funicular is free. The maximum capacity is 20 people and operating hours are 10:00-23:30 to match the operatings of Namsan Cable Car.The ticket price for the Namsan cable car is 8,500 Won return ticket for an adult (equivalent to about GBP 6.00 Aug 2017). The queues build up during the late afternoon/early evening times as a lot of visitors travel during these times to get a daytime and nighttime view of the N Seoul tower. If you wish to avoid the queues, you should go in the mornings. The cable car operates from 10am to 11pm."
Don't do it; just walk up to the tower...,"As we wanted to see the sun going down, we went here around 16.00 (on a work day in autumn), to be surprised by a long queue. This turned out to only be the line for the cable cart; a 45 minute wait to get your tickets and another 45 minute wait to get up to the carts themselfs. The cable cart was only a disappointing 3 minutes, so I recommend walking up to the tower. Going back down with the cable cars additionally was an half hour queue."
Lazy way to go up,The price for cable car is a little bit expensive but you are served with beautiful trees scenery along the way. Plus you don't have to hike. Shuttle from Seoul Station to the cable car station is available.
"Nice cool ride, good views........","This cable car ( actually, it is a big single ropeway car like those in Japan) takes you all the way up to the mountain top of Namsan Park. Seems they only have 2 Ropecars- one going up & other on the way down). Long wait.Surprisingly as the car ascends, you will notice it is quite high up. The views along the ascend & descend were very nice. Especially with the beautiful sun setting in the horizon.This is the best way up to Namsan Park unless you want to hike up on alternative route. ( not sure if there is)Don't come on weekends or holidays. As it is, the queues today ( weekday) for tickets stretches all the way from ground floor to 3/4floors where the boarding area is. There is also an even longer queue on the Ormi Elevator ( see review of Namsan Park)."
Nice,"Cost 8500 won for a return cable car ride.Takes around 2 mins to go to the top.Luckily the sky was cleared today, you can see miles away.The multi colour of the tree leaves in November was so special.Highly recommended if the weather is nice and sunny."
Easy way to get to N tower ,"If you are tired or can’t walk uphill, this a salvation to get to N tower, takes a while to do the line, but sometimes even it is crowded you can get it in matter of minutes "
Good for one time,Good for one time. I visited with a friend on sunday and it was very crowded so we had to wait for quite a long time. The ride was short but it was fun. You can see some parts of Seoul during the ride. Not breathtaking but a nice experience overall.
Great views on the way up and crazy arcade at the top,"We queued for about 30 mins and so got up just as the sun was going down. The views of the city from where the cable car drops you are largely obscured by the trees but you could climb the tower to get better ones. However the views on the way up are stunning and at the top are various bars, restaurants and even a games arcade. This felt wonderfully incongruous but we had a lovely time enjoying it. Well worth checking out."
Easy way up Namsan with great views,This is a great way to see Seoul from the top. I would suggest taking the cable car up (one-way) and then walking down on the way back. A lot of people were walking up but I personally don't like the steep steps up!Restaurants and shopping at the top if you are into that.
Almost 2 hours waiting time,"If you travel during peak session do expect to wait for 1 - 2 hours. Normal time should be within 30 minutes. Restaurant and mart available inside the station.Walking distance from Myeongdong area, about 15 - 30 minutes by foot to reach the cable station. Round trip price for adult 8500w & 5500w for children."
Go early or WAIT,After midday you'll be looking at a long wait. Each car can get like 40 people in but they only run every 10 mins. I was there 10.30 and waited about 15 mins including ticket. I recommend the cable car up and walk down. Cost for adult 6000 KRW
"Convenient, Exciting Ride",You have to queue long for this short ride but it's worth it. The view is beautiful at night but I believe it will look even more splendid during the day in spring. Ride up from Myeondeong!!
early morning jog,close in the morning. maybe opening hours is 10am. but nice to go up and see the view of seoul. good exercise going from myeongdong to namsan cable car.
Best way to get to the tower,"It might be a bit crowded, but it is worth taking the cable car in the hot summer days instead of walking to the hilltop. It is not that pricey and it is fast."
Expensive and inconvenient,"The cable car journey is short. The cable car station is located at the mid of the hill. That is, we need to walk up the hill before you get a ride to cable car. After we arrive the hill top station, we still to walk up many stairs in order to get to N Tower. From transportation view, it is bad.The fare is expensive and not worthy.Since the journey is short, we can see the Seoul city view but the time available is very short."
love the city view,For $8 you can take the convenient cable ride up to Namsan Park I would recommend going on a sunny day because then you'll get most of the view of the city below and see the lovely mountains surrounding the cable car it's definitely worth a trip get there quickly so you can get a good view in the train. 
Convenient ,"Namsan Cable Car runs from the base of Namsam Mountain up to Namsam Park. It is the easiest and most convenient way to get up to the N Seoul Tower. Glass on ALL four sides giving riders a wider view of the surrounding cityscape. The entrance fee is 8,000 Korea won. "
Famous movie/ TV Series Shooting site,"It is worthwhile visiting N Seoul Tower. I was quite excited by the fact visiting the movie/ TV shooting site, incluing Boys over flowers/ The Legend of the Blue Sea. Time everday 10 am - 11 pm. On the top of Namsan, the scenry is beautiful. Day & NIght both good, different. From Myeongdong subway station - 12 - 15 minutes on foot, alternatively by taxi - 3 - 5 minutes, depending upon traffic. Return FareS - Adult KRW 8.500 (approximately USD 7.50) Children KRW 5,500 (USD 4.92)"
not impressive,"I sure am glad I went during a quiet time and had only a minimal wait - especially after reading other reviews talking about 2 hour waits for this underwhelming 3 minute cable car ride. I would have been furious to wait that long for this banal experience.If I hadn't done the Bukhansan hike the day before, I probably would have just walked up but I was feeling lazy. In future I think I'd either walk up or take a taxi.Not sure why the cable car runs only every ten minutes. Seems like it could go more frequently than that and cut down on waiting times.If you arrive and there's a long queue, I'd highly recommend making other arrangements to get to the top of the hill."
The easiest way to get to N seoul Tower,"Visit N seoul tower which is located at altitude, using Cable car this is one of the right choice. To go to cable car location can use public transportation from myeongdong station or use Namsan Ormi. Avoid coming to visit on weekends, because the queue will be quite long to buy tickets ( but If lucky enough, the queue could be quite short as we got on the weekend time). on weekend, in addition to foreign tourists, many local residents also use this cable car to visit N seoul Tower."
Best choice to namsan tower,Very crowded although week day and must waiting too long. The best to see seoul at night very beautiful. 
The obvious choice if you are going to N Seoul Tower,"To reach N Seoul Tower, the choice is simple - put some leg work up the hill or take the cable car. Most will choose the latter for obvious reasons. The cable car station can be reached by another interesting mode of transport.... a funicular elevator. Go there on a weekday to avoid the crowds and long queue. "
Essential on a hot day,"This cable car will take you from Namsan park to the base of the Seoul Tower. Don't become blasé about how long and hard the walk is if you do not take the cable car. You must be super fit to attempt the walk. The cable car is safe and takes about 7 minutes to go up and vice versa. There is a limit to people getting in so when its full you wait until the next one. If you do not want to attempt the Seoul Tower then this is a good ride to take as you will get to the bottom of the tower and there is plenty to do there. Restaurants, ice cream stuff for the adults and kids alike. A great photo taking opportunity from the top of the cable car and along the way."
Going to Namsan Cable Car from Starria Hostel,"We stayed in Starria Hostel when we spent out holiday in Korea.Starria Hostel.located in Myeongdong which is many hotels,guest houses,hostels, restaurant,mall,etc.Myeongdong have a popular place for travellers.it called Myeongdong Market.many shops offer cosmetics,food street,fashion,etc.And in Myeongdong Area/District we can find Myeongdong Cathedral,on of UNESCO's Heritage Building in Korea.From Starria we walk to the south,along this road,until you find upstair which connected to another road.Walk 10 -20 mins you will find Namsan Cable Car.That place can bring you to the top of Namsan Tower without walking from bottom to Tower. We didnt use Cable Car..but we dont use Cable Car to Namsan Tower. We walk to the Top of Namsan Tower.From Namsan Cable Car we can walk 10 minutes to Namsan Park and continue walking to the top due to about 1 hour.The Cable Car will stop around The Tower.there are many locks which we call them Love Lock.it means that your love is locked and you must throw away the key of the lock."
Waiting for so long ,"My first time to Seoul tower was taking a bus, and this time we wanna try the other way, so we took cable car! It's not on vacation, but I was surprised that so many people lining up there! It took us almost 30 mins to get on the cable car. The view was not that amazing as I expected, and it's quite fast!( 10 mins to N tower) Well, it took me so much time for waiting! I would like to take a bus if I go next time. "
Crowded during holidays ,"Avoid taking the cable during holidays or weekends, you'll have to queue for hours. You can take the cable car one-way up and hike down , it won't take much time or effort and you'll enjoy the scenery as well. "
Trip to Seoul,Be prepared to wait for at least 1 hour to take cable car to the mountain peak. Adult ticket is 8500 won while children below 3 years old to elementary is 5500 won.
Very enjoyable experience,"This was a nice way to avoid the endless amounts of steps on the way to the top of the tower. It's very clean and safe. Although I do not know Korean, I had no problems interacting with the ticket counter folks or other employees."
Large cable car,Quite long Que but the cable car can occupy about 30-40 people at one time and the cable car arrives within 5-10min... so the long Que is quickly shorten
Long que,Visit this tower during winter. Long que start from staircase from ground floor to 4th floor (if im not mistaken) for the cable car. We have to wait about 2 hours. Nice view but its too cold with strong wind from top and im not really enjoy my trip because i had infant with me.
Very busy on the weekends,The best time to use the cable car is during the week because the line is very winding and even stretches outside for just the ticket booth. Once you get your ticket you have more winding lines to wait for the cable car. Try to get a spot on the windows of the car for great views.
Easy to find and good for winter :)),"As per the title of the review, it's very near and easy to find from Myeondong stn exit 3. And in the cable car, you can see beautiful view. One point to note is that they will squeeze the cable car fully. FULLY. So if you wanna take photo on the way up, it's a pretty hard. But if you are going to go to Namsan Tower Observatory, you can even more beautiful scenery there :)) "
Only Transport to the Tower,"Don't take the cable car for the experience, take it as a means of transport to the tower. It was not even a weekend and we had a 40 minute wait and then squashed into the cable car like sardines. Same on the return trip, but you have to queue outside and it is freezing. They split you off into groups of the maximum number of people and then open the door. If you get a chance get to the back of the cable car on the way up and the front on the way down as that is the best view. You will probably have to give the glass a quick clean to get any clear photos. w6000 one way, w8500 rtn."
One good way to reach Namsan Tower,This cable car take you from the car parking lot and drop you at the Namsam tower square in less then 5 minutes. It costs Krw 8500 for one adult round trip. The city view from there very nice and you can take pictures from inside.
Good service,"This cablecar terminal is within 10 minutes walking distance from subway station. There's taxi provided just outside the terminal. But if you're bringing old fella or little children, it's recommended that you take a taxi or bus from subway station to the terminal."
Be early to avoid long queue,"We were here on the last day of the year. Be early to avoid long queue, unless you are interested for the evening view of Seoul. Buy a return ticket for more value of your money."
"Fun, useful but crowded",The Namsan hill is very steep so that makes this cable cart very useful. The views are nice but the carts are way too crowded so it will be hard to enjoy the view. Luckily the ride only costa a few Euros and it saves up a lot of time.
Average experience,"As others have said, this is used to get up the hill without walking, but not much more. It was not as packed when we arrived at around 4:00 pm, but the view from the car is secondary to the view from the top and the top of the tower. Really just saves a walk up hill, which was key with our kids. "
Take the stairs!,"This is your typical cable car like there are so many, with a nice view along the way that quickly brings you to the N Seoul Tower. However, I was there on a Saturday evening and it was very crowded - had to wait for an hour. You'd be better of taking the stairs: you don't have to wait, it is free, you can take time to enjoy the views along the way, it is not that far in the end and you'll get a great workout while climbing!"
Cable car,Very cool! You can see the whole city from up there which is huge. The tower is beautiful as well...
Take the bus to N Seoul Tower,"Don't waste your time or money (8500 won roundtrip!) taking the Namsan cable car up to N Seoul Tower. Take the bus instead at a much lower cost and it also saves you time! You will not miss anything by just taking the bus.I was initially tricked into taking the cable car. I waited for the N Seoul Tower bus in Myeongdong. A bus came by indicating that it would take me to the N Seoul Tower. I asked the bus driver and he said it would go to the N Seoul Tower. I was a bit wary as the side of the bus indicated the Namsan cable car, but the driver insisted that he would go to the N Seoul Tower. I was a bit angry when it only took me to the Namsan Cable Car station. This is a pure ripoff as the cable car is much more expensive than the bus up to N Seoul Tower.I made the best of it by then buying the cable car tickets. Unfortunately, the wait was nearly 30-45 minutes, with the line snaking through the building and at times hidden from view! It is made like a Disney theme park line so it's hard to tell the wait - and the customer service doesn't tell you the wait time!The cable car itself is quite disappointing. It is standing room only (suffocating at times). It was sunset when we took the cable car and unfortunately, the views are also quite disappointing as you don't get a large panoramic view as the view is actually fairly limiting. The ride is only three minutes in length.Also beware that if you return to the cable car station after 8:30 PM, the complimentary bus stops running after 8:30 PM! That's what happened to me and I was forced to take a taxi back to Myeongdong. The taxi driver charged me upfront 20000 won for a short ride back to Myeongdong. I eventually reported the driver to the Seoul government complaint website and supposedly the driver was disciplined (even though I doubt it and the driver will probably do it again).All in all, don't waste your time in dealing with these deceptive practices being run by the cable car company."
"Namsan Cable car in Seoul, South Korea","Our taxi driver dropped us here when we asked about how to get to the Seoul tower and we took the cable car to get to the top. It is a quick ride to where the tower is and it's a good chance to see the city from above. Return ticket will cost slightly less than single ride tickets. (Ok, avoid this place if you are afraid of heights, just saying...)"
Come earlier to avoid long Queue,Came here on Sat afternoon. We followed prev reviews to go up the slope near Pacific hotel but missed the part to turn right. We walk up all the way and its a a pretty steep slope. At the end after the stairs we turn right and walked along the path next to the shops area towards namsan cable car. We came around 1-2pm and queue was 40mins long. When we came down around 4-5pm the queue was all the way till outside the building.. super long.And we realise that if u have walked along the roadside from myeondong station there is actually a lift at the bottom that will take you to the cable car station. This easier option is much recommended than the steep climb.
Used this to get to N Tower.,Nothing spectacular. Consider this as a convenient way and in expensive way to get up to N Tower. WE bought a couple ticket which gave us 2 dinners and round trip tickets for 30000 KRW (round trip ticket itself cost about 8500krw per person)..
The view before reaching the tower...,Took cable car to reach the Namsan Tower where you can experience the view that breathtaking. Be patience because the queue can be long but it's worth waiting.
One of kind experience,It was just a ten minute walk from our hotel but as expected when I arrived the line to get a ticket was too long. But the view when your in the cable car was worth the wait.
Great view of Seoul ,The Namsan cable car is a great way to kill a couple hours while enjoying the great view of Seoul. There are two options to get up to the top. You can pay right $8 one way to ride the sort cable car that takes roughly 5 mins to get to the top. Or you can walk up the stairs for free. The area at the top is huge so there are plenty of places to walk to enjoy a different view of the city. 
very nice view,you can see the whole city is beautiful i did cable car to go up and use starway to go down so i can see both way is its along walking down but if you ask me would i do it again my answer is YES!!!!
Squashed in like sardines,"We took the cable car to the Seoul tower. It was a week day night and quite busy. The cable car didn't leave until it was packed full of people. I'm sure the view was great but being short, I couldn't see a thing as I was jammed into the middle. Make sure you push your way to the windows, where you can see the view, and you get some fresh air. There was either no air conditioning or it wasn't working. Made for an uncomfortable journey. Thankfully it's a short one!!"
Cable Ride,For the lazy ones like us and does not like the hike up and on time constraint--- try the ride. It cost around 8000won return ticket. Its a little difficult to appreciate the view since a lot of people cramp in a little space. 
Sardines in a can,"Uncomfortably crammed into each cable car on the way up and the way down. If you're fortunate enough to have your face pressed against the glass, then you can get a decent view of the city. It serves a purpose as an easy way to the N Seoul Tower but I think it was quite pricey for the experience. "
There is a big line!,"In the same price I could take a taxi.The ride it self is pretty short, and you really ""pay"" by waiting. It would be nice if they told you there is a big line to get on the cable car(and it is not visible when you are on the other line to get the ticket). It was two floors line, took 20 minutes to get on the cable car. Also be aware that there is a line on the way down too(little bit shorter, but maybe it was because of the hour)"
Don't use the cable car for anything except getting to the top.,"The cable cars have glass all around htat gives you some decent views, but nothing compared to the views you get at the top of Namsan Tower or at the top of the hill. But it is worth the cost round trip if you don't feel like hiking. I didn't have time for the hike."
Scenic Ride ,After the tower you can take the cable car down by the road to pick up a taxi. It's about a 2 min ride and costs 6000 WON per person. Views are good too. 
Pleasurable,"We got the cable car because it was too hot to walk up the massive hill. It wasn't too busy and cost 6,000KRW per person. The views are really lovely- just make sure you are by the window! We ended up walking down rather than taking the cable car though, beautiful views."
Very nice ,If you come early around 11:00 you should not have any problems. The views are great and it's a great place to visit for couple of hours.
Gateway to the Tower,"We chose to do the cable car going up to visit the tower. It was a short wait for a ticket, and then a longer wait to get on the car.You are squeezed like sardines and very few people can see the view .There is an elevator up the stairs for the elderly and disabled / mothers with strollers.Even though it's expensive and little bit uncomfortable, you can go to the Namsan tower much easily."
Pleasurable Experience,"We chose to do the cable car going up to visit the tower. It was a short wait for a ticket, and then a longer wait to get on the car. Our trip up was at night and offered a fabulous view of the park and the city. It was a smooth ride up. We chose to walk down and were very glad for it as the line to go back down was very long."
Average,"Just 12.000 won for a one way ticket, and this crowded cable car will get you to the bottom of Seoul tower. The views are not that spectacular."
crammed into the cable car,"I visited on a weekday at around 11 am, the queue to buy the cable car ticket was long but moved quite fast. I didn't really like the experience of queuing to ride the cable car though, the attendants pack everyone in like sardines, and people just push their way into it for the window view. I will rather take the bus and hike up to Namsan Tower."
Go on weekdays and before dark ,No waiting time nice and fast. We skipped the tower so it took us around an hour for a round trip That's all I have to say 100 char limit 
Very long waiting time - choose day wisely,"We tried to go to the N Tower twice. We wanted to see Seoul at night so we got to the cable car 9pm on Saturday - BIG MISTAKE. the queue was so long that we would not make it in time to get back (cable car closes 11pm while the N Tower is open till midnight). We returned Sunday at 7:30pm and the waiting time to buy the ticket was 5 mins (plus another 30 mins to actually get into the wagon). You are squeezed like sardines and very few people can see the view (I was lucky to see it). Round ticket for adult is 8,500₩. You can see a lot of the city from the car itself if you are by the window so not sure if really worth paying additional 10,000₩ for the N Tower admission. It's a close walk the Namsanog Hanok Village and they have some food stands at the top."
Whhhhyyyyyyy?!?!,"Wait for car is long (when you get to the point it says 60minutes, add another 30). Cars are large and people are packed in like cattle. There is an elevator up the stairs for the elderly and disabled / mothers with strollers, however, in my experience my wife was allowed to go up with the stroller whisky I was left to carry the bay up the stairs ( good hour long epic). This ,ah be the best way up the mountain, but by international standards, it's a poor,y designed and organised experience. Cable car building has very dirty stairwell. Looks like it's very rarely cleaned. "
Geumosan Cable Car,"Explore another place..from the cable car you can see alot of cherry blossom,yess it bcoz autumn in seoul.."
Worth the money ,"This location is a 20 minute walk uphill from Namsangol Hanok Village, or a short cab ride for 3,000 won. The cost of 8,500 won was worth it to me for a round trip ticket in the cable car. It cut time down instead of trying to walk up the hill. The day I went was gloomy and sprinkling but the cable car was still running. While visiting in the afternoon, very busy with tourists so you will be packed like sardines in the cable car. Lots of restaurants outside of entrance of cable car. Highly recommend to save time and shoe leather. "
Gateway to the N Tower,"if you don't like making a walk up the mountain, the cable car is a very cheap alternative for a round-trip ride up to the N Tower."
Now it's OK,"Even though it's expensive and little bit uncomfortable, you can go to the Namsan tower much easily :)"
Crammed into a car,"The car saved us from walking up to the tower, but the ride was not pleasant, with way too many people in the cable car than comfortable. People also push to get their way to the edge of the car for selfies with the window view. It was not a cheap journey either!"
An easy way to reach the N Seoul Tower,"Of course a bit more expensive way than using stairs, but it gives you an exhilarating thrilling feeling when the cable car goes up from the lower station. We did both ways and they are worth doing. Be aware that evening rides may be crowded and you have to wait a long time before having your turn."
Long lines during peak times - consider walking it for a challenge!,"We went around 4 PM so the lines to buy tickets and board the cable car were about 2 hours long. Once up to the base of the tower by cable car, there are shops and a few things to see, but there are a lot of people awaiting their elevator time slot so it can be crowded. The views from the top are nice and the city lights are very pretty. The line to come down can get long so be careful you aren't stuck at the top near closing time, as you have to remember you need to take not only the elevator down but the cable car (or a long walk down the stairs). I would say it is worth it but budget enough time. (at least 4-5 hours if starting n the late afternoon/evening"
Fun way to get to the tower,"it was expensive, but i wanted to try at least for once. Instead of walking up the hill I took the cable car, the summer view was great. "
Save your knees and relax ,"I walked namsan park from Seoul Train station so I'd already had a pretty good workout following the Seoul city wall. It's worth the 8,500 ₩....yes it is. You get a return trip for that price. Be aware you do get crammed in. 7,000 ₩ if you want a one way trip. Pretty nice views on the way....be prepared for a little swaying as people seem to like moving around in the car!"
Worth at least a one-way trip,"The Namsan cable cars were worth the purchase. During my visit to the N Seoul Tower in January the cold was almost unbearable, so my friend and I opted for a round trip just to get out of the cold. That was the best decision as we got to see some nice views from the car. Unfortunately it was really crowded inside, so picture taking and moving to another side of the car was almost impossible. The ride is pretty short as well. "
Cable car up to namsan,Round trip ticket cost 8500won. Waiting time is acceptable if u avoid peak hour (: each cable car come every 5mins.
Nice ride and easy access to N Seoul Tower!,"We were there on sunny Sunday (plus there was some kind of local festival in Namsan Park), so there was a lot of people and we had to wait to get into the car, but it was expected.Raid itself was fast and if you are next to the window (like we had the luck to be the first ones to get into the car) you will see a nice panorama of the Seoul :)"
Don't get fooled by locals: Take the cable car!,There are 2 ways to get to the top of the hill: 1) Walking 2) Cable car.A local told us that it was just a few minutes walking up or a long wait for the cable car. Don't ever belief a local if telling this! It was a long climb up and hardly a wait for the cable car (we saw that on the way back). It is certainly worth the money if you want to up the hill.
Nice ride on a clear day,"Easy to access and the ride take you up the fast way. For the bravest, you can take the stairs on the right that goes from that point to the Seoul Tower. Can be crowdy, but at the time of our visit at the end of November, not that many people."
was visited seoul early novermber this year..i was stay at I-House GuestHouse and 2 minutes walk up to namsan tower,u willl able to see a view from cable car. very nice especially during autumn & spring. there's a restaurant too on top of the hill. but quite expensive. there are so many restaurants down the hill and much cheaper.
"Cool views, if you can see!","They pack people in like sardines, but otherwise, it's a good experience. Best way to get up to the tower, unless you want to walk!!"
Easiest way up to Seoul Tower,Pretty standard cable ride up. It's obviously a short one. I highly recommend taking one way up and walking down. It's a very pleasant 30 minutes walk. I came at around 10:30am and there were not many people. It was easier to get there via taxi.
Worth doing but wave loads of time to queue!,Went here a couple of days ago and didn't really rate it. We waited 70 minutes just to get on and you are literally on it for just 2 minutes. There are only 2 cable cars. 1 goes up while the other Comes back down so the line moves very very slowly. You can walk up to the top of the hill which would be loads quicker but it is a fairly steep hill
Great view of Seoul,You'll have to take the Namsan Cable Car up to the N Seoul Tower. We decided to go up at night. Wasn't disappointed. The view was amazing.
Short ride,This is a short little ride of less than five minutes. Good for older people and kids.Otherwise you may enjoy a little hike up.The cable cars end at around 11pm and tower doesn't allow to go up after 10:30pm so make sure to time your ride correctly.
"Great but short lived view, very slow service","The view of Seoul from the cable car is great if you can get a good spot. Very, very long wait as only two cable cars service the mountain and are ten minutes between journeys. They cram way too many people in, so if you don't get a good spot around the windows you might not get to see much and the whole trip will have been wasted. Will definitely be walking up the mountain next time. "
An easy journey to the top!,Buy your ticket to go to the top and then walk down. It takes about a five minutes journey and is very busy. I was packed in and couldn't take any photos!
Good value,"There was a long line when we arrived but it moved pretty quickly, you can't possible expect there not to be a wait on a major attraction like this. It was not over priced and the staff were very efficient. The ride up was smooth and fast. We were all very happy."
Convenient service,"Definitely a must if you are planning to go Namsan Tower! I went to Seoul during Summer 2014. We took quite some time walking from the Train Station to Namsan Cable Car with such a hot weather. Instead of taking another walk to the tower, we choose to take the cable car with affordable price instead. The journey is less than 10 minutes. "
Only if you are tired.,"Walk up to N. Seoul Tower if you have the energy. Or take a bus up. The line is soooooooo long. It took me almost 2 hours to walk from myeongdong to the outside elevator that takes you up to here (the elevator also had a line but not as long as the cable car line). Then another 2 hours to get on the cable car.It was nice though. But very crowded. Tip for future visitors. If you want to use the cable car and see the sunset at N. Seoul Tower, COME HERE AT LEAST 4 HOURS BEFORE SUNSENT."
very nice ride,"we enjoyed our ride to the N tower using the cable car. Although it is slow and takes time queuing on the ground but each cable car can accommodate around 20 people, and you will enjoy the scenery view."
Useful transport - once you find it!,"Walking from Myeongdong, I found it very hard to find where the cable car station was located even with the official Seoul Visitors Map as my guide. Once I found a very handy lift that takes you from the top of a long staircase up from street-level to the cable car station, I didn't have any more problems. I bought a return ticket and only had short waits each time for the car to come. Both trips were somewhat crowded, so I had limited ability to take in the impressive views of Seoul below."
Waited forever,"Decided to go up to see the sunset, so we were there an hour before the sunset- bad idea. The wait took us 3 HOURS!!! The queue was just not moving at all and we didn't realise at that time that apparently theres also a bus going up?! The ride is decent price but not worth the view, the cable cars are packed of people, so you won't see much- and everything you see, you will have a better view up at the hill anyway.. Maybe we just had bad luck, but oh my god how annoying it was to wait in a crowded humid room with no vacant seats.."
Longest wait of my life,The wait took 30 minutes. So we decide just to take the one way up because the wait was to long. But the prices are great. If you dont like heights+moving cable car do not try this! The people we rode with were walking and jumping around like crazy!
Good service,Very good service. The cars arrives in maximum 10 minutes. The price is not high and you can if want up and down or only one. Have a waiting room and restaurants. Perfect view in the way.
Expensive and very busy,"The cable car starts from Myeongdong and the ride takes 5 mins max.It is often very busy and thus the queues can be long, very long. One way costs the $6 USD, which is twice of what a taxi will cost. The views on the way are ok, but nicer once on the top."
Night at Namsan Tower,"A very good place to see Seoul especially at night. A place to vow your love with your love lock! Bring your own love lock and written message to lock it there! But of course if you have forgotten to bring your padlock, you still can buy the lock there! "
Amazing place with a very nice view,Very nice place from where you can city the city of seoul . It's better to go before the sunset and stay after to see the charm of the city in day time and night time.
"Great for Kids, Parents in Their 60s, Couples on Honeymoon, & Those Who Want To See Seoul From Inside A Cable Car :)","I didn't plan on going on the cable car but my knees and feet were still sore after my hike up to Hallasan in Jeju before I went to Seoul. So I skipped walk to the N Seoul Tower and bought myself a return ticket for the cable car ride. As expected, everything was very well organized and maintained. Buying the ticket was super fast. No problem finding the way to the cable car. No problem getting into the cable car although a huge crowd was slowly queueing up - no drama, no unsatisfied customers making a scene because they had to wait too long, nothing. Everything went smoothly.The ride was short but I did get a good view of beautiful Seoul from inside the cable car. The announcements were also made in English. Clean. reliable schedule, professional staffs,the toilets were clean, there's a cafe/mini convenience store to get a cuppa and what have yous. A good experience all in all."
Use this if you have limited time,"It was a bit expensive ($6 for one way, and $8,5 for two ways), but if you are too lazy to climb up the hill, or too afraid of going down, or don't have much time, I recommend you to use since it only took less than 5 minutes to reach the tower. But it based on luck because normally you have to queue."
Nice view of Seoul,The cable car ride was a nice view of Seoul. We went on the weekday morning and didn't have to wait too long to get on a cable car.Glad that we took the car ride up. We still had a nice walk up to get to the Namsan tower platform area.
Avoid,"Super long queue, (waited for more than an hour) and then a very short ride. Avoid! Best to hike to the top."
skip it,"The ride is so short and unless you get a standing window view, it's very unmemorable. Overpriced for the short ride, too. My second time up. First time was 20 years ago. This experience was a bit worse because the lines are longer now. Take the scenic hike up or down if you can."
Long queue,"Had read about long queue's on the weekend. It's true! After eventually finding the escalator and queing for that, we got to the ticket counter where the sign said 60 minute wait...ended up being just under 2hrs. Sardine style 3 min ride"
Clean and Helpful,"Fastest way to reach Namsan Seoul Tower. The Cable Car Station is easy to reach from Myeongdong but the road is quite an uphill, so you better use Namsan Orumi if you think it will be hard for you to walk on an uphill road."
Use your legs instead ,You are paying to stand in a long long line that will lead you by their coffeeshop. Tourist doesn't like to wait so they will push and show no concern about others than themselves. When you finally arrive to the cable cart you won't be able to see anything because they stuff the cart with people like a stuffed thanksgiving turkey. Save your money and walk up
Great Experience,"It's near the Myeondong Shopping Area, it's actually walking distance & accessible by bus & cab. :) 1 cable car can fit 15-20 people. :)"
Nice ride. A bit tricky to get there. ,"The cable car experience itself was great. Speedy, stable and a lovely view. The downside for us was the website for the cable car. It mentioned the free ascending elevator service to get to the cable car from a lower street, but the directions to get to it were not clear. We wandered quite a bit to find it from Myeongding station. The tourist info at the station had no idea of a free elevator service. Anyway, we did manage to get in and then enjoyed our Namsan experience. "
Fun way to get up to Seoul Tower,Did a round trip fare on the Cable Car and it's a more relaxing/fun way to ride to the top as opposed to walking or bus. Nice if you've never done it before.
Hi View,"If you want to see Seoul 360'..You Should goThe Namsan Cable Car is one of the many ways to get up to the Namsan Park. First, you'll have to take a small tram leading to the cable car station and buy your tickets"
Exciting with Good View,"If you want to go to the N Seoul Tower, try taking the Namsan Cable Car which will take you at he base of the tower. You can opt not to go up the tower. The view of Seoul at the base is already fantastic. Although from the nearest station, you have to walk a bit uphill to get to the 'terminal'. We went there on a weekday night so there are less crowd and no long queues."
One way to get to N Seoul Tower,A convenient way to get to the N Seoul Tower. You can access to the cable car station via the Namsan Oreumi (sidewalk elevator). Beware that the staff will try to squeeze as many passengers as possible into the car!
Exciting ride!,"The Namsan Cable Car is one of the many ways to get up to the Namsan Park. First, you'll have to take a small tram leading to the cable car station and buy your tickets. The round trip ticket is much more worth than the single journey ones. The cable car fits more than 30 people at a time and it will only depart when the number of people is enough so you might have to wait a while if there are not enough people. The 3-minute ride itself enables you to have a fantastic view of the city so make sure to get your camera ready. As for the safety aspect, I have no complains as there is a staff in the cable car who controls the journey and ensures a smooth ride. The next time you are going up to Namsan Park, make sure you take the cable car ride up."
super crowded,its super crowded on the namsan on Saturday night.. its full of couple :)the view is amazing..and its soo romantic :)
Looong wait!,"Avoid weekend evening/nights at all costs!We went on a non-holiday weekend Saturday night and it was PACKED! We had to wait 2 hours to get on the cable car but there were no signs outside warning us of the expected wait. It wasn't until we had bought our tickets that we found out it was going to ""up to 2 hours wait""Be careful not to get trapped like we did with non-refundable tickets by following the simple rule of thumb. If there is a lineup outside the actually building, take a taxi up. Besides, the view isn't amazing from the cable car."
An OK cable car.,"The nearest Metro station to the cable car is Myeongdong.It's a good 700 meters walk (partially up hill).Upon arrival, you take an inclined elevator to the entrance and from there the fun begin.""Fun"" is a relative thing, that it.While there was no queue while we visited, the ride itself (9 US$ return ticket) was not very eventful nor long.The view is a big meh, and is mostly made up of residential and office buildings.The hill itself is beautiful and looks just great while passing above it.Is it worth the time and effort? Well, the climb is rather steep and is almost impossible while the stairs are slippery, so yes, while not a ""must"", it's an ok experience."
Terrible... waste of time.,"Waited ages to get on the cable car and they pack you in so tightly, you can't see anything going up unless you're up against a window. Very poorly planned. Only 2 cars going back and forth. Very disappointing especially having experienced other cable car rides in other countries. Would have given it zero stars if I would. "
"Waste of time, money, and inconvenient","I've visited Namsan Tower four or five times in my nearly two years in Seoul. Today, for the first time, I took the cable car. Normally, I walk up the trails to the top, but this time I was with my 77 year old mother. For her sake I figured taking the cable car would be easier since it drops you off right at the base of the tower. Bad call.I didn't realize that the walk to the cable car building was going to be long and up a steep incline from the Myeongdong subway station. Normally I wouldn't care, but since I thought it would ease my mother's burden, I figured this was the best option for getting to the top. Isn't the point of a cable car to save you the energy of walking up a hill/mountain? Why not start it lower down the hill and give the riders a longer ride. Speaking of longer ride, the whole trip up is about three minutes! 6,000 won one way for only that? Not worth it at all. This is even coming from someone who had a good view on the cable car and only had to wait about 20 minutes in line. I know most people have to wait an hour or more and often times have a bad view in the car. If that was our case, I'd feel very angry and cheated. I still feel that way, just to a lesser degree. Overall, hike up the mountain and don't take the cable car. With someone who isn't capable of that? It still may be easier to get the bus to the Seoul Tower stop and walk the final half kilometer or so up the hill."
Nice ride but long queues ,"The wait is too long. Nothing wrong with the ride itself, it was fun, but you have to queue both to get to and from the park. I recommend other forms of transport if you don't like standing in the queue. "
"Without Doubt, Waste money and time!","I had waited for around 1 hr until taking cable car. But when my turn came, I was very surprised because it looked like public bus. It was not comportable and there are to many people in a cable car. They said max capacity is 48 people. So I could not see outside. It was a just transportation.DO NOT TRY THIS. WASTE TIME AND MONEY!!!"
Good quick way up to Namsam Tower,Easy to get tickets took four kids (between 3to 8) & two adults was fab way to get to the top of Namsam loads walks down to whichever area. Went on a bank hols and was not busy if you get there before 10am.
Beautiful,"Although you have to wait in line for a couple of hours ( we wanted to take it at night ) it's worth every penny. If you are a Kdrama lover, you will be reviving Boys Over Flower's JanDi and Joon Pyo sleepover in the car. Just breathtaking views."
Nice ride,"A return trip on this cable car cost 8,500 won. It's a fast and fun way to arrive at N Seoul Tower. To arrive at this cable car, you need to alight at Myeongdong subway then hike up the road to this place. It's quite taxing due to the elevated road but worth it.At peak hours, the cable car can be too crammed but still okay."
"Great views, Great experience!","If you're heading up to the Namsan tower, why not take the cable car for a great affordable experience! Awesome views of Seoul!Instead of taking the cab to the tower, grab the cable car instead! It was awesome and i definitely think its worth it!"
A good way to get to N Seoul Tower quickly,"If you want to visit the Seoul Tower and must do it in a rush, then take a taxi. But if you have some time and do not mind standing in a potential long queue, then this can be a good choice. The ride cost 8500 won return ticket and takes just a couple of minutes, which is good since it will most likely be very crowded. If you are in good shape and can spare a day or so, try hiking up instead through Namsan park and use the money for lunch or an extra beer."
A must do while in Seoul,"Wonderful city views provided from the Car and once atop Namsan (Mount Mongmyeok) where, if you are with your lover, you can purchase a lock and throw away the key, symbolically locking your hearts to each other there on a fence/lock wall. Its a lovely idea. You can also get dressed in traditional Korean clothing and have your photo taken. If you want to save some money, bring your own lock. :)"
